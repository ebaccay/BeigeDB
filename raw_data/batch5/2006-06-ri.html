      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity grew more slowly in recent weeks, as a continued 
  decrease in housing activity was joined by some downshifting in the manufacturing 
  and retail sectors. District housing markets, while still relatively strong, 
  continued to soften as sales slowed in many areas; real estate agents anticipated 
  a further downward drift in prices. In May, factory output nearly flattened 
  following several months of growth, with new orders decelerating sharply as 
  well. Services firms and tourist establishments noted somewhat faster growth 
  in their revenues, but retailers reported weaker sales. Despite evidence of 
  softening economic activity, District labor markets remained strong outside 
  of decreased hiring by factories. On the price front, upward pressures pulled 
  back somewhat in May, though manufacturers told us that sharply higher input 
  prices squeezed margins and many would attempt to raise their prices going forward. 
  On District farms, generally dry weather assisted planting efforts but had little 
  negative impact on crops as yet.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenues at services firms grew at a faster pace since our last report. Financial 
  services contacts in Richmond, Va., and Baltimore, Md., told us that business 
  remained strong, though they noted increasing caution among their clients as 
  interest rates rose and real estate markets slowed. A North Carolina-based trucking 
  contact said customer demand remained solid and that a new distribution center 
  near Greensboro would likely boost the area's economy going forward. Turning 
  to prices, contacts at service-producing businesses reported that the pace of 
  increase moderated somewhat in May, but they looked for price growth to quicken 
  in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally grew at a slower pace in May, though some contacts noted 
  that sales began to pick up at mid month as warmer weather took hold. In South 
  Carolina, contacts at two large building supply businesses said the pace of 
  sales declined in May as construction activity slowed and energy prices rose. 
  A chain department store manager in Virginia Beach, Va., said business at her 
  store had been good, but that stores at other locations had not done well in 
  May. In contrast, a central North Carolina department store manager noted that 
  his sales firmed around Mothers Day and continued strong for the remainder of 
  the month, leaving his non-seasonal inventory "a little light." And 
  a contact at a regional hardware and building supply chain added that his late 
  May revenues were boosted by sales of generators and shatter-resistant windows 
  ahead of the hurricane season. Contacts reported that retail price growth eased 
  slightly in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity flattened in May following a marked pickup in 
  March and April. Shipments, new orders, and capacity utilization grew more slowly 
  last month, while employment and order backlogs contracted. Among industries, 
  furniture, rubber and plastics, and transportation equipment reported the biggest 
  declines in output. Manufacturers noted a softening in hiring after several 
  months of moderate payroll increases. In addition, the average workweek declined, 
  although wages maintained the solid trend of recent months. Contacts said raw 
  materials and finished goods prices increased less rapidly than in our last 
  report. But manufacturers remained alert to increasing price pressures, and 
  many planned to raise their prices in coming months. A North Carolina plastics 
  producer, for example, said that his company's margin was too thin and the firm 
  would work to get their prices up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers reported a dichotomy between residential and commercial lending. 
  Demand for residential mortgages decreased while commercial lending remained 
  strong. Most mortgage lenders attributed the deceleration in residential demand 
  to rising interest rates. A Charleston, S.C., banker noted that increasing mortgage 
  interest rates had slowed lending, especially on second mortgages and re-financings. 
  In contrast, commercial lenders reported activity remained fairly robust, noting 
  that loan pricing remained highly competitive. Typical of the reports was that 
  of a Charleston, W.Va., lender who said that his bank "sacrificed some on the 
  yields in order to maintain market share."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate agents across the Fifth District reported that housing 
  markets remained generally strong, though sales, traffic, and prices continued 
  to slow in some areas. Real estate agents in Odenton, Md., and in Washington, 
  D.C., each reported slower home sales. The Washington, D.C., agent reported 
  a continued decline in contracts and in buyer traffic. He told us that residential 
  re-sales were down sharply, and that market inventory had tripled from year-ago 
  levels. In contrast, a realtor in Greensboro, N.C., reported that home sales 
  remained "pretty good," and Richmond and Virginia Beach, Va., agents reported 
  healthy activity though the properties were not moving as quickly as a year 
  ago. Most real estate agents told us that prices were holding steady although 
  there was some indication that softening was becoming a bit more widespread. 
  Low- to middle-price homes continued to be the best sellers throughout the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate agents reported continued growth in leasing activity. 
  Gains were generally concentrated in the industrial sector, with office and 
  retail leasing also remaining fairly strong. Agents reported little change in 
  vacancy rates, which continued to be tight across the District. A retail contact 
  in Richmond, Va., reported that there had been "a lot of absorption due to a 
  lack of major projects." Agents also noted an increase in rent, especially for 
  office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. Contacts at hotels along 
  the District's coast told us that bookings for the Memorial Day weekend--aided 
  by near-perfect beach weather--were much stronger than a year ago. Tourism at 
  mountain resorts in Virginia and West Virginia was also stronger. A manager 
  at a mountain resort in Virginia said demand remains so strong, they are offering 
  fewer discounts. In contrast, a hotelier at Virginia Beach indicated that she 
  had to offer more discounts on selected rooms in order to fill their hotel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary employment firms in the District generally reported stronger demand 
  for workers in April and May. An agent that serves Washington, D.C., and Maryland 
  continued to report that they experience a "generally hot economy," making it 
  more difficult to find qualified workers. Likewise, in Raleigh, N.C., an agent 
  told us that a pick-up in the local economy had boosted the demand facing his 
  firm, but a lack of qualified workers could hamper their ability to ramp up 
  production. High-end administrative and specialty skills, clerical, and forklift 
  skills were highly sought.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Dryer-than-normal weather widened the planting window for District crops in 
  recent weeks. Cantaloupe, tomato, and watermelon plantings were well ahead of 
  schedule in South Carolina, and great progress was made in planting peanuts 
  and soybeans in Virginia. Despite the dry conditions in some areas of Virginia 
  and the Carolinas, agricultural analysts characterized crop conditions as "fair 
  to good" throughout the District. In addition, with drier conditions, livestock 
  and pasture conditions deteriorated somewhat in South Carolina but were reported 
  to be good in West Virginia.
