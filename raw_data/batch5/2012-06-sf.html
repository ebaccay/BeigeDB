      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to grow at a moderate pace   during the reporting period of April through late May. Price increases for final   goods and services were very modest, and upward wage pressures were quite   limited overall. Sales of retail items rose, as did demand for consumer and   business services. District manufacturing activity picked up further. Sales   remained robust for agricultural producers, while conditions were mixed for   providers of energy resources. Demand rose modestly for residential real estate   and also improved a bit for commercial real estate. District banking contacts   reported that overall loan demand edged up, and they noted further slight   improvements in credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation remained quite limited   for most final goods and services. Contacts noted price declines for energy   inputs, particularly oil, and for an assortment of food items at the retail   level. More generally, upward price pressures were quite modest, as suppliers of   final goods and services were readily able to meet the existing modest growth in   demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts reported that upward wage pressures were quite limited overall. High   unemployment and modest demand for new hires continued to hold down compensation   gains for workers in most industries and occupations. However, wage and   compensation gains remained substantial in various industries and regions for   workers with specialized skills in the application of information technology.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales grew modestly on   balance. Gains were reported by traditional department stores and discount   chains alike, although contacts noted a slightly slower pace of growth compared   with the prior reporting period. Inventories generally were at or near desired   levels given the current pace of sales. Demand growth slowed for retailers of   home furnishings and major appliances, resulting in mostly flat sales. Demand   was largely unchanged for grocers. Sales of new automobiles rose during the   reporting period, although the pace of growth has moderated from that seen in   the most recent reporting periods. Demand remained strong for used vehicles and   combined with tight inventories to keep prices elevated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business and consumer services rose a bit further on balance.   Activity was largely flat for professional services such as legal services and   accounting, as well as for health-care services. By contrast, demand improved   for transportation services such as trucking. Sales rose at a modest pace for   providers of technology services, with the pace held down in part by weaker   sales to European buyers; however, contacts continue to anticipate that growth   will pick up in the second half of the year. Activity expanded further for radio   and television broadcasters, spurred by rising demand for advertising slots.   Sales activity improved further for restaurants and other food-service   providers. District travel activity continued to pick up, with contacts in major   markets such as Southern California, Hawaii, and Nevada highlighting ongoing   improvements in visitor counts and hotel occupancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity rose   further during the reporting period of April through late May. New orders   continued to improve for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology   products, and inventories were reported to be at appropriate levels given the   prevailing pace of sales. Contacts in the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector   reported robust demand. Orders grew a bit for makers of commercial aircraft and   parts, driven primarily by demand for fuel-efficient aircraft, and an extensive   order backlog kept production rates at very high levels. For petroleum refiners,   strong global demand supported an uptick in capacity utilization rates. Demand   improved slightly for steel manufacturers but remained depressed for   manufacturers of wood products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for   agricultural products remained robust, while extraction activity for energy   resources continued to be uneven. Orders and sales expanded further for most   crop and livestock products, spurred in part by strong growth in overseas   exports. However, contacts noted that the costs of energy inputs remained quite   high, and they cited renewed concerns that drought in some areas may undermine   growing conditions in coming months. For energy resources, elevated price levels   continued to support a pickup in oil extraction activity. By contrast, price   declines for natural gas resulted in a further reduction of extraction activity,   primarily at sites for which the extracted amount of valuable liquid byproducts   is low.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District home demand   improved a bit further overall, and demand for commercial real estate picked up   slightly on balance. Sales of new and existing homes ticked up in many areas,   although the pace remained well below its historical average. The pickup was   supported in part by slight improvements in financing availability, which has   been an important factor holding down sales in the recent past. Faster sales   reduced the inventory of available homes, which in turn caused home construction   activity to rise slightly in some areas. By contrast, home prices remained   largely flat. On the commercial side, vacancy rates for office and industrial   space stayed elevated throughout many parts of the District. However, contacts   noted widening signs of improved demand. The San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle   markets continued to benefit from growth in the technology sector, which is   prompting rapid absorption of commercial space and encouraging new construction.   Contacts noted improved demand for office and retail space in other areas as   well, such as Boise, Idaho.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand showed further slight gains overall.   Although businesses remained very cautious in their capital spending plans,   demand edged up a bit further for new commercial and industrial loans.   Furthermore, reports from most sectors suggested that capital spending is likely   to increase modestly in the second half of the year compared with the first.   Demand for consumer credit appeared largely unchanged. Further improvement in   overall credit quality was noted, and continued fierce competition to extend   credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses has kept a lid on   loan rates and fees. Overall, however, lending standards remained somewhat   restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans.
