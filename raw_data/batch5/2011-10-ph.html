      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Third District has remained mixed, with more   positive sectors than negative ones compared with the previous Beige Book. In   late August and early September, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee left   dozens of people injured or dead, damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, and   cost hundreds of millions of dollars in disruption and damage throughout much of   the Third District. Since the last Beige Book, manufacturing activity has   declined further, but at a slower rate. Retailers reported flat to slightly down   year-over-year sales. Motor vehicle dealers provided a bright spot with stronger   year-over-year sales. Third District banks have reported little overall change   in loan volume outstanding since the last Beige Book. On balance, residential   real estate and construction activity have been slightly stronger since the last   Beige Book, which was released soon after the debt-ceiling turmoil. Commercial   real estate contacts have continued to report steady to slightly improved market   conditions in most parts of the Third District. Service-sector firms reported   generally flat to modest growth. Price pressures have moderated for many sectors   but continue to strain profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Third District business contacts had already lowered their expectations   over the past few months--projecting slow to flat growth through year-end.   Ongoing uncertainty since the previous Beige Book has not significantly altered   their outlook. Manufacturers still expect a modest rise in shipments and orders   during the next six months. Retailers are hopeful for stronger sales, and auto   dealers are uncertain; both have lean inventory plans. Most banking and   residential real estate contacts had lowered their expectations before the last   Beige Book. Commercial real estate contacts and service-sector firms continue to   plan for slow growth; however, uncertainty has increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers reported further decreases in new orders and shipments; however,   the rate of slowdown has lessened and is less widespread. The makers of primary   metals, fabricated metals, and electronic equipment reported declining product   demand. However, growing product demand was reported by makers of food products,   lumber and wood products, industrial machinery, and instruments, and by printers   and publishers. Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee were mentioned positively   (as a source of increased demand for cleanup, repairs, and emergency equipment)   and negatively (for flooding, harvesting problems, and shipment delays) by   almost equal numbers of firms. However, most firms were unaffected. Two key   firms that supply or service manufacturers and other broad sectors have reported   steady modest growth since the last Beige Book. Both anticipate stable growth   from most of their clients (except defense-related firms) for the remainder of   the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve   during the next six months, despite expressing significant uncertainty. Since   the last Beige Book, the general outlook has improved substantially, with nearly   one-third more firms expecting an improvement and one-third fewer firms   expecting a decline. Capital spending plans among area manufacturers remain   slightly positive; however, significant uncertainty has been expressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For most of August and September, Third District   retailers reported that sales were flat to down compared with a year earlier.   However, "October started off with a bang," said one department store chain   manager. Low consumer confidence and rising uncertainty were widely cited as   reasons for maintaining low inventory levels as the holiday season approached.   Missed profit opportunities may result if the holiday sales prove stronger than   last year, but a flat to down season could force further retail store   closings.
                Auto sales picked up in August and September, according to Third   District auto dealers. Sales growth meant market share losses for Honda and   Toyota, which have resumed full production, but whose dealer inventory may not   be fully replenished until early 2012. Inventories remain lean and used cars   remain scarce, leading to strong prices for dealers. Limited rehiring may ensue,   if sales growth continues.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      At most of the Third District banks contacted for   this report, total outstanding loan volume has been roughly level since the   previous Beige Book. Overall, commercial and industrial loans and commercial   real estate loans have contracted somewhat. Bankers anticipate continued low   consumer loan demand due to high unemployment rates and ongoing deleveraging,   which has accelerated with the recent surge in refinancings. Credit quality,   along with growing corporate and household cash balances, is improving. The   outlook among Third District bankers interviewed in September is that total loan   volume will expand only slightly over the remainder of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity in the Third District has been mixed with sales rising, then falling   since the previous Beige Book, and with builders reporting slight gains in   activity. August sales figures finished up over the year, but agents reported   that September would be off last year's pace. Properties are moving, but   inventory remains very high. Overall, 2011 sales are expected to be lower than   2010 in all three Third District states. While trends and timing varied across   states, builders reported somewhat stronger activity overall, since some   distance has passed since the debt-ceiling debate. Still, sales remain   difficult, and buyers noncommittal, as economic uncertainty increases. "People   are really scared," said one builder. Labor and material costs have flattened,   but list pricing has, as well; therefore, builders are struggling to hold   margins. The industry remains cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      Caution guides the commercial and industrial real estate sector as well, but   the sector is less susceptible to the news cycle. Since the last Beige Book,   continued slow growth has been observed, with select markets beginning to   tighten. In those markets, vacancy rates tend to drop, rents rise, and   concessions disappear. Investor interest has picked up, but deals remain   difficult to close. New construction or renovation plans are mostly limited to   institutional, life sciences, multifamily, and warehousing sectors in selected   markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District service-sector firms have   reported flat to modest growth since the last Beige Book. A logistics firm   reported above-average improvement, noting some growth was seasonal. A staffing   firm noted that its flat activity was marked by relatively greater interest in   workers with high skills or low skills and little or no interest in workers with   medium skills. The debt-ceiling agreement has increased caution for   defense-related firms and may be a cause of future layoffs. These firms as well   as several other large service firms reported greater efforts to expand their   overseas markets, where their growth rates have been stronger. Firms remain   generally positive, but very cautious, reporting that their own customers often   delay decisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the previous Beige Book, general   price levels remain contained. Price pressures have flattened or lessened   further for retailers, service-sector firms, and builders for most factor   prices; however, margins remain very tight. Retailers did note increases for   cotton products. Manufacturers have been reporting slightly greater price   pressures and modestly greater success at passing along those costs. Rents are   rising in a few select markets, but house prices remain soft or are falling, and   wages pressures are low. However, reports of shortages of skilled labor may   reflect unrealistically low wage offers.
