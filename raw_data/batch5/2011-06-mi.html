      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Ninth District grew steadily since the last report.   Increased activity was noted in consumer spending, tourism, services, commercial   construction, manufacturing, and energy and mining. Residential construction and   real estate and agricultural activity decreased, while commercial real estate   activity was flat. The job market continued to strengthen moderately since the   last report, while wage increases continued to be modest. Significant price   increases were noted for wholesale items, but retail price increases were   moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending grew   moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   March and April increased 2 percent compared with a year earlier. Sales and   traffic have generally been higher than a year ago at a Montana mall, but were   softer in mid-May. Sales and traffic are about even with a year ago at a South   Dakota mall, according to the manager; cool weather seems to have slowed apparel   sales. An auto dealers association in North Dakota forecasts a 10 percent   increase in vehicle sales for 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      While spring tourism activity was soft in many areas due to cold and rainy   weather, tourism officials were optimistic for the summer season. Based on   summer reservation levels, the outlook for Minnesota tourism businesses was   upbeat. Spring tourism activity was slow in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, but   inquiries for summer travel options were up, according to an official.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction   activity increased in April. The value of commercial building permits in April   increased from the same period a year earlier in both the Sioux Falls, S.D., and   Fargo, N.D., areas. A data center in the Minneapolis area plans an expansion due   to strong demand. Residential construction decreased from last year. The value   of residential building permits in April dropped 27 percent from the same period   a year earlier in the Sioux Falls area; in Minneapolis-St. Paul, the value of   permits dropped significantly from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets were steady since the last report. According   to industry analysts in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, office vacancy rates   declined slightly, retail vacancy was flat and industrial vacancy rates did not   change much. Home sales during mid-May in Minneapolis-St. Paul were down from   last year's tax-credit-driven sales, while new listings increased. April home   sales in Billings, Mont., also decreased from last year's tax-credit-driven   sales, while the number of homes available for sale increased. Meanwhile, the   number of homes for sale in both Sioux Falls and Fargo was down from a year ago.   The inventory of homes held by lenders in Minneapolis also increased.   Multifamily housing vacancy rates declined, and rents increased over the past   few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Professional business services firms reported   increased activity since the last report. Preliminary results of a mid-year   business outlook poll by the Minneapolis Fed found that professional services   respondents expect to increase sales and profits over the next year after gains   during the past 12 months. The survey also revealed that access to bank credit   over the past three months has improved, leading businesses to plan expansions   and increase capital expenditures. An environmental consulting firm noted a   strong increase in orders from the public sector and slight increases from the   private sector. Information technology contacts noted an increase in activity   over the past two months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity increased since the   last report. A May survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota and   North Dakota. A Sioux Falls manufacturer of electronics and aerospace products   is expanding its operations. A bank director reported that manufacturers saw   higher productivity and increased their equipment purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Late-May oil exploration activity   increased from early April, and two natural gas processing plants are planned in   North Dakota. Wind-energy development projects continued since the last report;   however, a $400 million wind-power project in North Dakota was canceled because   of potential threats to endangered birds. Iron ore mines in northern Minnesota   are operating at full capacity. A mining company is in the early stages of   exploring a potential $1.5 billion taconite mine and processing plant in   northern Wisconsin. Metals prices remained strong, and Montana mines were   operating at near capacity. A potential gold/zinc mine in Michigan's Upper   Peninsula is under consideration.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District agricultural producers were hampered   by continued poor weather conditions. Wet fields kept spring plantings of corn,   wheat, soybeans and sugar beets well behind their five-year averages in   late-May. Prices for most District agricultural commodities increased since the   last report, including corn, wheat, cattle, hogs, eggs and soybeans. Poultry   prices were flat, and dairy prices decreased slightly. Of respondents to the   Minneapolis Federal Reserve's first quarter (April) Agricultural Credit   Conditions Survey, 83 percent reported increased farm incomes in the previous   three months; 57 percent thought incomes would increase in the next three   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The job market continued to   strengthen moderately since the last report. According to the preliminary   results of the Minneapolis Fed's mid-year outlook poll, 30 percent expect to   increase full-time employment at their firms over the next 12 months, while 22   percent will decrease staff. Some district companies reported difficulty finding   workers to fill information technology jobs, certain health care occupations and   skilled manufacturing positions. A North Dakota agricultural producer noted a   short supply of qualified agricultural implement mechanics and technicians. An   online retailer will add 200 jobs in North Dakota. In Minnesota, a   communications firm announced plans to hire 450 workers for a new call center, a   health care company will hire 100 more employees and a power generation firm   will add 90 employees. In contrast, a defense contractor said it will close an   operation affecting 100 workers, a meat producer will lay off 90 employees and a   health care organization will lay off 70 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases continued to be modest. According to the preliminary results   of the Minneapolis Fed's mid-year outlook poll, 66 percent expect wages to   increase 2 percent or less. Two placement agencies in Montana reported that   while demand for employment services is up, most wage increases have remained   below 3 percent. However, some Minnesota small businesses were facing increased   wage pressures for professional and skilled labor, but not for unskilled   labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Significant price increases were noted for wholesale items, but retail price   increases were moderate. Bank directors reported a number of input price   increases, including petroleum-based products, some metals, rubber, health   insurance and food. Prices of large tires for mining and farm machinery   increased over 50 percent recently. Minnesota gasoline prices were down from   recent peaks, but were still over $1 per gallon more than a year earlier.
