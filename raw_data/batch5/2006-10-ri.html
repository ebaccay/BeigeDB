      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District expanded at a moderate pace in late 
  August and September, as firmer factory output and somewhat stronger store sales 
  were balanced against a continued weakening in housing markets. Manufacturing 
  shipments and new orders rebounded in September following a soft patch in August. 
  Retail sales increased more quickly outside of housing-related categories and 
  domestic automobiles. Revenues at services firms continued to expand on pace 
  with a notable pickup at computer-related businesses. Both construction and 
  sales of houses softened further in most markets, though activity edged higher 
  in a few areas. In banking, mortgage lending weakened, while commercial lending 
  was steady. Tourist activity was temporarily dented in early September by Hurricane 
  Ernesto, but held up in areas away from the coast. Labor markets remained generally 
  tight, with hiring increasing modestly at factories and services firms. Skilled 
  workers remained difficult to find, and some upward wage pressures were noted. 
  Price pressures were more pronounced in manufacturing, but the pace of increase 
  moderated in the services sector. In agriculture, substantial crop damage was 
  inflicted by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but subsequent weather conditions 
  have been favorable for harvesting activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported that home-related sales slowed, though retailers 
  in other categories said their sales grew more quickly in late August and September. 
  Executives at two building supply chains told us sales growth at District stores 
  eased as new residential construction softened. The pace of sales also cooled 
  at furniture and home accessories stores in central Virginia, according to an 
  industry contact in Richmond, Va. In contrast, a contact at a chain department 
  store reported increased sales growth at District locations. Additionally, the 
  manager of a chain department store near Charlotte, N.C., said sales at his 
  store have been "going strong," as area manufacturing jobs expanded. 
  In the eastern panhandle of West Virginia, the manager of a discount department 
  store told us that the pace of sales has picked up since our last report. District 
  automobile dealers said the overall pace of sales steadied during the last four 
  weeks despite softer domestic automobile sales in some areas. In labor markets, 
  retailers continued to trim employee levels, although retail wages rose sharply 
  in the last four weeks. Contacts indicated that price growth in retail was moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenues at service-producing firms grew more quickly since our last report. 
  Contacts at professional, scientific, and technical firms indicated that demand 
  strengthened over the period, particularly at computer and web-related businesses. 
  An executive at a financial services firm in Baltimore, Md., attributed his 
  clients' bullishness in part to the recent drops in energy prices. In addition, 
  District airports recorded an increase in air travel, although one airport manager 
  said more people are driving instead of flying for short trips because of the 
  "hassle factor" of security related to air travel. Hiring at services 
  firms picked up slightly in recent weeks; wage and price growth moderated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity picked up in September. Manufacturers told us that shipments 
  grew briskly following a contraction in August, while new orders gained momentum 
  and employment growth remained on pace. Contacts in the electronic, plastics, 
  and printing and publishing industries reported particularly strong growth in 
  demand since our last report. A printing and publishing manufacturer in South 
  Carolina, for example, said that some firming of local economic and employment 
  conditions helped boost their revenues. A plastics producer reported that they 
  were "still busy with good projects," and an electronic equipment 
  manufacturer in Maryland indicated that their sales were notably stronger than 
  a year ago. In contrast, a producer of residential doors in North Carolina reported 
  a substantial decrease in orders. Factory hiring expanded on pace with recent 
  months and wages increased somewhat more quickly. Manufacturers told us that 
  raw material prices jumped higher in September and that prices for finished 
  goods rose moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers reported some softening in lending activity in September. Mortgage 
  lending was particularly weak. A banker from Charleston, S.C., noted that "September 
  loan volume looks like it is going to be about the same as August. Typically, 
  we see a pickup in September, but not this year." Commercial lending, 
  however, held up since our last report. A banker from Charleston, W.Va., for 
  example, said that his bank was able to maintain its lending volume by competing 
  harder. "There is a lot of hunger out there for the good deals, and we 
  have to be more aggressive to get the new deals and keep the old deals," 
  he said.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate agents across the District noted generally slower home 
  sales in September. A Washington, D.C., agent described that area's housing 
  market as "horrible," adding that sales volume was down 25 percent 
  from a year earlier. Additionally, he reported that home inventories had risen 
  sharply and that some sellers were trimming asking prices. In Virginia Beach, 
  Va., an agent also noted weaker home sales, saying that buyers were being more 
  selective. Many District agents told us that inventories in their housing markets 
  continued to rise and that buyer traffic had slowed. In contrast, contacts described 
  the Charlotte, N.C., market as strong, and an agent in Greenville, S.C., reported 
  good local housing market conditions. Also, a Fairfax, Va., agent reported renewed 
  sales activity in September, though he was not optimistic that it would hold 
  through year's end. He noted more interest by investors in purchasing 
  properties to hold, "for a while." Modest decreases in home prices 
  were noted by contacts in many areas, and an agent in Richmond, Va., told us 
  that sellers were offering more incentives to prospective buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate agents across the Fifth District reported that leasing 
  activity remained steady in recent weeks. An agent in Richmond, Va., said that 
  client interest and inquiries increased, though actual activity had yet to improve. 
  A contact in Washington, D.C., however, noted a slowdown in retail leasing. 
  He speculated that a reduction of consumers' wealth had forced area retailers 
  to curb their expansion plans. On balance, there was little change in new construction 
  reported across the District. In addition, little change in vacancy and rental 
  rates was noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity changed little on balance since our last report. Contacts in 
  coastal areas said that bookings declined in early September in the wake of 
  Hurricane Ernesto, but that activity rebounded later in the month. A contact 
  on North Carolina's Outer Banks said that the construction of rental homes 
  had leveled off but noted continued brisk remodeling activity. She also indicated 
  that consumer spending had increased as gas prices declined. Contacts at mountain 
  resorts in Virginia told us business had picked up and that timeshare sales 
  were particularly strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary employment agencies in the District generally reported firmer demand 
  for workers. An agent in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area indicated continued 
  strong demand for temporary workers in all skill areas--especially in the warehouse, 
  distribution, and manufacturing industries. In Richmond, Va., an agent reported 
  that some additional strengthening in the area's economy helped boost 
  demand for employees fluent in Spanish, especially in the transportation and 
  healthcare industries. Most agents continued to have difficulty finding skilled 
  workers. Temporary workers' wages remained steady across much of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tropical storm Ernesto brought much-needed rainfall to the Fifth District in 
  early September, but hindered field work and damaged crops in low-lying fields 
  in coastal regions. Analysts in North Carolina told us that tobacco farmers 
  in the state lost 25 percent of their crops because of flooding from Ernesto, 
  and incurred $76 million of crop damage across 19 counties. In South Carolina, 
  crop and other farm damage from Ernesto was estimated at $11.5 million. In contrast, 
  drier weather returned to the District during the latter part of September, 
  allowing farmers to keep harvesting activity on schedule. In Maryland, farmers 
  were beginning to harvest their soybean crops; the harvesting of corn and sowing 
  of barley were progressing well in Virginia, and the apple harvest was ahead 
  of schedule in West Virginia.
