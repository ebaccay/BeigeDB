      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eighth District has continued to expand at a modest   pace since the previous survey. Manufacturing activity has continued to   increase, and activity in the services sector has also increased. Residential   real estate activity has continued to decline, while commercial real estate   market conditions have been mixed. Overall lending at a sample of large District   banks saw little change during the fourth quarter of 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in   January and early February were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier   levels. Half of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 37 percent saw   decreases and 13 percent saw no changes. Roughly 71 percent of the retailers   reported that sales levels met their expectations, 17 percent reported that   sales were below expectations, and 12 percent reported that sales were above   expectations. About 21 percent of the retailers reported that their inventories   were too high, while 12 percent reported that their inventories were too low.   The sales outlook for March and April was mostly optimistic: 65 percent of the   retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 13 percent expect   sales to decrease and 22 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's   sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that sales in January and early February   were up slightly, on average, compared with last year's sales. About 48 percent   of the car dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 32 percent saw   decreases and 20 percent saw no changes. Twenty-eight percent of the car dealers   reported that used car sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 24   percent reported the opposite. Thirty-two percent of contacts reported an   increase in sales of low-end vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while 8   percent reported the opposite. Thirty-two percent of the car dealers surveyed   reported that their inventories were too low, while 24 percent reported that   their inventories were too high. The sales outlook for March and April was   mostly optimistic: 76 percent of the car dealers expect sales to increase over   2011 levels, while just 4 percent expect sales to decrease and 20 percent expect   sales to be similar to last year's sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several   manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near   future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or   decrease operations. Firms in the furniture, automobile, food, stone product,   air conditioning component, and medical device manufacturing industries   announced plans to increase existing operations and hire new workers.   Additionally, firms in the automobile parts and primary metal manufacturing   industries announced plans to open new plants and hire workers. In contrast,   firms in the faucet, chemical, paper product, and lawn mower manufacturing   industries announced plans to close plants and lay off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the District's services sector has continued to increase since   our previous report. Firms in information technology services, pest control   services, distribution services, health services, and leisure services announced   plans to expand operations and hire new workers. In contrast, contacts in   freight transportation services, education services, government services, and   business support services announced plans to decrease operations and lay off   workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales continued to   decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with 2010, total 2011   home sales were down 2 percent in Memphis, 3 percent in St. Louis, 4 percent in   Louisville, and 6 percent in Little Rock. Residential construction also   continued to decrease throughout the District. Total 2011 single-family housing   permits decreased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with   2010. Permits decreased 15 percent in Louisville, 20 percent in Little Rock, and   21 percent in St. Louis. However, permits increased 1 percent in Memphis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate conditions were mixed throughout the   Eighth District. Contacts in Memphis reported weak commercial real estate loan   demand but stable industrial real estate activity. Contacts in Louisville   reported that commercial real estate activity has increased since December 2011   while contacts in St. Louis noted an increase in fourth-quarter 2011 office and   industrial vacancy rates compared with the third quarter of 2011. Commercial and   industrial construction also varied throughout the District. Contacts in south   central Kentucky noted that commercial construction is showing improved activity   with recent business additions and relocations in the region. Contacts in   western Kentucky, however, noted that construction projects are very scarce,   with the exception of Owensboro-Daviess County, which has a significant number   of public and private projects underway. Contacts in northwest Arkansas noted an   increase in commercial building construction in the Bentonville area, while   contacts in Little Rock continued to report overall weak construction   activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity   during the fourth quarter of 2011. During this period, credit standards and   demand for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged. Credit standards   for commercial real estate loans also remained unchanged. Demand for these loans   ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards for   consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand ranged from moderately weaker to   about the same. Credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans ranged   from unchanged to somewhat eased, while demand for these loans ranged from about   the same to moderately stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Yields for corn,   sorghum, hay, soybeans, and cotton were lower in 2011 compared with 2010, while   yields for winter wheat, rice, and tobacco showed positive gains. Monthly output   of commercial red meat for December 2011 decreased compared with November 2011;   the District's total live weight and number of chickens slaughtered also   decreased during the same period. The District's coal production for January   2012 was 1 percent lower compared with January 2011. Similarly, as of early   February, year-to-date coal production was 4.2 percent lower than the same   period in 2011.
