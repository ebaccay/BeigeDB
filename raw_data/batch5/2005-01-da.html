     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace 

  from mid-November to early January. While still mixed, manufacturing activity 

  strengthened some, particularly for chemicals and energy-related products. Service 

  sector activity was still strong, but there was some softening in demand for 

  temporary workers. Retail sales were mixed, while construction and real estate 

  activity picked up slightly. Energy activity continued to strengthen. Overall 

  lending and deposit activity continued to grow, and credit quality remains stable. 

  Agricultural conditions have been favorable.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Energy prices fell during the period but still remained relatively high in comparison 

  to 2002 and 2003. Crude oil prices are down since November, and crude inventories 

  moved above the five-year average in December, after being below the five-year 

  average all year. Heating oil and retail gasoline prices have also fallen. Inventories 

  of heating oil remained near the bottom of their five-year range, but inventories 

  of gasoline returned to normal. Natural gas inventories are more than 10 percent 

  above normal, and prices have fallen but remain very high compared to average 

  prices in 2002 and 2003.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers continued to be concerned about input cost pressures. Several 

  industries said high energy prices have pushed selling prices up more than is 

  typical for this time of year. Declines in the value of the dollar have increased 

  the cost of some inputs, such as fabricated metals. Stiff competition is limiting 

  the ability to pass along cost increases. Rising prices for coke, coal, steel 

  and aluminum have led to slight increases in selling prices for some primary 

  metals. Higher input costs for paper products have pushed up selling prices 

  for toilet paper, tissues and paper towels, but stiff competition is putting 

  downward pressure on prices of corrugated boxes. China's demand for aluminum 

  has raised selling prices here, according to contacts. Rising cost pressures 

  are also a concern for contacts in the service sector. Some firms are able to 

  pass these cost increases onto their customers, but in other industries, contacts 

  say stiff competition limits their ability to raise selling prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Market
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor markets remain quite soft overall, but appear to be slowly improving. 

  Hiring continues to gradually strengthen in the service sector, with scattered 

  reports of difficulty finding qualified workers in some occupations. Some manufacturing 

  firms continued to report limited hiring or additional layoffs. Contacts in 

  the lumber industry, however, report plans to increase employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There were more signs of strengthening in the manufacturing sector from mid-November 

  to early January. Demand for construction-related manufactured products has 

  been stronger than usual for this time of year, partly because late fall rains 

  pushed construction work into December. Lumber sales remained at high levels 

  and producers of stone, clay and glass said demand was higher. Holiday demand 

  for food products was stronger than usual, according to contacts, who said this 

  was a very strong year for the food industry. District apparel manufacturers 

  report no change in demand. Producers of paper and paper products also reported 

  no change in demand over the past few weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales growth increased slightly for semiconductor manufacturers. Producers 

  noted continued gains in productivity and little overall job growth. Inventories 

  were reported to be in good shape. Demand for consumer communications equipment 

  slowed slightly at the end of the year after very strong growth in the first 

  three quarters of 2004. Producers noted that demand for products, such as cell 

  phones and personal communication devices, was strongest from markets outside 

  the United States, such as from Asia and Europe. Demand picked up slightly for 

  industrial communications equipment, such as switches and power sources, and 

  growth is now about the same as a year ago. These firms say demand from businesses 

  has improved recently but consumer activity has been unchanged over the past 

  year. Further layoffs are anticipated as a result of investments in productivity-enhancing 

  capital equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for primary and fabricated metals was unchanged from mid-November to 

  early January. Sales of primary metals continued to be slower than in the third 

  quarter--for some metals substantially slower. Contacts continued to cite lower 

  levels of consumer confidence and foreign trade competition as possible reasons 

  for slower activity, expressing concerns that China may become a net exporter 

  of steel. While overall employment has been unchanged, employees are working 

  shorter hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical producers continued to report strong increases in activity. Domestic 

  and international demand has been strong for chlorine, caustic soda, ethylene 

  and olefin products. Contacts say that record exports were stimulated by gains 

  in the price of oil relative to natural gas, as well as a drop in the value 

  of the dollar. Demand for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) also remained strong, although 

  rising ethylene prices have squeezed margins. A major new PVC and chlor-alkali 

  complex was announced on the Gulf Coast, the first major expansion announcement 

  since the late 1990s. Gulf Coast refiners have finally returned to high levels 

  of operation following hurricane-related downtime.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Temporary staffing activity softened slightly in the six weeks since our last 

  report. Demand from light industrial manufacturing remained strong while demand 

  for clerical workers slowed. Contacts said they are concerned about being unable 

  to raise fees to completely offset an increase in their state unemployment tax 

  rates. Demand for accounting services remained very strong. Activity was still 

  mostly to support requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. Contacts say 

  firms are hoping to be more efficient complying with regulations this year because 

  they have experience with the new rules. Accounting companies are still hiring 

  "a lot of new people," and one contact said his firm had to turn away work for 

  a lack of professionals to staff the project. Demand for legal services has 

  been strong, driven by both transaction and litigation work. Hiring is up, and 

  fees for legal services are rising, but not dramatically. Costs are largely 

  unchanged, they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroads reported strong demand and rising prices. The trucking industry 

  reported steady demand. Contacts say profits are being squeezed by high fuel 

  prices and medical insurance costs because intense competition limits their 

  ability to pass on cost increases to selling prices. Demand for air travel was 

  up over a year ago, and airline industry contacts said planes have been flying 

  fuller. Still, excess capacity is putting downward pressure on prices, keeping 

  airlines focused on cutting costs to improve their balance sheet positions. 

  Further layoffs are expected at some carriers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales reports were mixed. The Christmas season started slowly, but sales 

  growth picked up as the holiday approached and were strong in the days after. 

  Stiff competition and weak sales early on led to significant discounting at 

  some stores, but other contacts reported good margins. Only a few retailers 

  were left with excess inventory. Auto dealers reported sluggish sales and inventories 

  are higher than desired. Selling prices and profits are down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for housing picked up from mid-November to early January, following a 

  cooling that was reported in the last Beige Book. Realtors and home builders 

  expect a slightly slower year in 2005, and remain focused on the need for job 

  growth to stimulate activity. Multifamily contacts said Austin's market continues 

  on the road to recovery, but Houston and Dallas' apartment markets have been 

  overbuilt and may not see improvement until mid-2005. There is still a lot of 

  vacant commercial space, but contacts said office leasing continued to pick 

  up at a slow, steady pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Lending activity continues to increase, with the strongest loan growth in commercial 

  and industrial categories. Mortgage lending is showing serious signs of slowing, 

  according to contacts. Deposit growth was reported to be stable to good, and 

  credit quality was unchanged. There are concerns, however, that credit quality 

  could begin to suffer in a few quarters due to competitive rate pressures between 

  the large number of banks in the larger Texas cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Land drilling has been mostly unchanged, but there was a pick up in offshore 

  activity, with the number of rigs working in the Gulf of Mexico rising above 

  100 for the first time since a year ago. The increase is in oil-directed, deep-water 

  drilling, with little change in shallow waters. Rates have been rising for deepwater 

  rigs for several months, but long-term contracts have been limiting availability. 

  Some contacts expressed the view that the recent leveling of drilling in the 

  U.S. reflects a shortage of land rigs. Demand for oil services has increased 

  with drilling. Contacts expect capital expenditures by oil producers to increase 

  as much as 10 percent next year. Some contacts said such expansion plans might 

  be constrained by shortages of equipment and/or workers with needed skills and 

  that would lead to increases in the costs of these inputs rather than increased 

  activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Soil moisture is adequate, but late fall rains delayed cotton harvest in the 

  Plains, and cotton gins are expected to run through March, which is unusually 

  late. Ranchers have expressed concerns about plans to re-open live cattle trade 

  with Canada.
