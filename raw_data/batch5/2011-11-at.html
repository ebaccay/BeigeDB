      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Sixth District business contacts described the economy as expanding at a   modest pace in October through mid-November. Retailers noted sluggish sales   growth compared with September; however, auto dealers continued to experience   robust sales. Tourism activity remained a bright spot for most of the District.   According to homebuilders and real estate brokers, sales of new and existing   homes remained weak, and home prices continued to decline compared with   September. Commercial real estate contractors and brokers noted a slight   improvement in nonresidential activity. Manufacturers reported an increase in   new orders but a modest decline in production. Lending conditions remained   constrained as weak loan demand from businesses and consumers persisted. Reports   from businesses suggest that hiring plans continue to be subdued and remain   weighted toward hiring temporary or part-time labor. Most businesses reported a   moderation in input cost pressures, but also noted limited ability to pass on   increases in commodity and other input prices from earlier in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The majority of District   retailers reported weaker activity in October through mid-November compared with   September. However, most merchants said sales were flat to slightly up compared   with a year ago. Inventory levels remained largely unchanged as stores have   continued with tight inventory management practices. Retailers anticipate   holiday sales to be flat to slightly up compared to the same time last year.   Auto sales advanced further, with dealers noting double-digit growth compared   with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism activity remained strong across the District. Hotel occupancy and   room rates were up and convention bookings remained steady. Cruise line contacts   reported full occupancy and increased onboard spending; however, advanced   bookings were down as people made reservations closer to departure dates. In   Florida, international tourists continued to bolster activity with increases in   Latin American visitors offsetting declines in European vacationers. Overall,   hospitality firms maintained an optimistic outlook regarding the upcoming   holiday season.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential brokers   indicated that sales softened in October through mid-November compared with   September, but were flat to slightly up compared with weak levels from last   year. Several brokers noted that potential buyers continued to face challenges   securing financing, while others said that deals were falling through because of   changes to appraised values or negative inspection results. Contacts continued   to report declining home inventories; however, despite fewer available homes,   foreclosures and elevated levels of bank-owned properties continued to put   downward pressure on home prices. District brokers anticipate sales growth to be   flat over the next several months.
      </p>
      <p>
       District homebuilders indicated that new home sales and construction activity   were flat to slightly down from the previous month and were slightly below weak   levels from a year ago. Homebuilders continued to report that new home prices   were largely unchanged compared with the previous month and a year ago. Builders   anticipate single-family home construction activity to remain flat over the next   several months. New activity in multifamily construction was reported in several   District states. Contacts in South Florida signaled that condominium development   was expected to get underway soon because of strong demand from foreign   investors, many of whom pay with cash. Developers plan to cover costs by   requiring a significant upfront payment from the purchasers before construction   begins. The outlook for new home sales growth over the next several months was   flat to slightly up compared with last year's weak levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of District commercial real estate contacts noted modest   improvement in nonresidential construction and leasing activity. Brokers   reported that vacancy rates declined and that rents have begun to stabilize   across much of the District. Contractors cited a small improvement in   construction activity from earlier in the year. Most anticipate commercial real   estate conditions to remain largely unchanged over the next several   quarters.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Transportation
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall, District   manufacturing activity weakened slightly from October through mid-November.   Contacts reported a slight increase in new orders, and production improved   modestly. Logistics firms noted that retailers had adopted vendor-managed   inventories, requiring the supplier to hold inventories until products were   ready to be sold. Some manufacturers indicated they were more likely to produce   and distribute on a made-to-order basis rather than taking the chance of being   caught with excess inventory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Transportation companies reported that demand flattened across most   industries. Few expect a significant increase in shipment volumes for the   holidays compared with last year. Railway firms cited strong automotive   shipments and very strong levels of coal cargoes destined for export. Air cargo   carriers noted that they have lowered freight projections for the year because   of lower demand and higher fuel costs. A few contacts anticipated modest   capacity cuts in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Banking contacts described lending   conditions as weak because of a combination of soft loan demand from qualified   borrowers and strict regulatory requirements. Companies continued to reduce   their debt loads and limited expansion plans and capital improvements.
      </p>
      <p>
       An informal poll of our small business contacts revealed that a slim majority   of mature firms received all or most of the full amount of money requested,   while many young businesses reported applying for credit to expand their   business but were either denied or offered unacceptable credit terms. Others   were discouraged from applying for credit because of the expectation that they   would either be denied or be offered unfavorable terms. Overall, 38 percent of   all small businesses polled applied for credit, compared with 32 percent in our   Q2 survey.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts suggest that employment   plans remained subdued across much of the District. Employers expect hiring to   be modest, mostly to fill seasonal positions or critical vacancies caused by   attrition. Many contacts noted plans to continue using temporary employees until   there is a significant and sustained pickup in demand. Companies also indicated   that they did not have any plans to cut employment further; employers felt that   they had streamlined their operations as much as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firms did express having trouble filling both some low-skilled and highly   specialized positions. Regarding the former, many contacts noted that   entry-level positions were not being filled because applicants were unable to   pass aptitude tests or background checks. As for the latter, many indicated   recruiting top performers from other firms instead of drawing from the   unemployed population. Overall, there was growing concern that the skills of the   unemployed were deteriorating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from some reports of increases for highly skilled trades, wage growth   remained subdued. Businesses reported a moderation in input cost pressures   during October through mid-November. However, with the exceptions of   manufacturing and some consumer goods markets, most noted limited ability to   pass on increases in commodity and other input prices from earlier in the year.   Margins remained tight, as contacts continued to characterize their customers as   being very sensitive to upward price adjustments. As a result, most businesses   continued to attempt to manage margins by focusing on minimizing their   costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Natural Resources and Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Energy industry firms   indicated that plans to invest in increased production capacity were proceeding.   New drilling technologies have reduced costs and increased extraction   capabilities for both oil and gas. In particular, contacts expressed that the   cost of unconventional drilling continued to drop, allowing for more   efficiencies and the ability to find and extract oil and gas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts reported strong overseas demand for proteins and related feeds. Farm   land values in the District were mixed; crop land values changed slightly, while   pasture land declined in some areas. To varying degrees, drought conditions   persisted in much of Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, and the panhandle of Florida.   In Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee cotton harvesting was ahead of   the five-year average, while Alabama was slightly below the average.
