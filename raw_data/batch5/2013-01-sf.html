      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 2013
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Twelfth District economic activity expanded at a modest pace during the   reporting period of mid-November through December. Upward price pressures were   limited overall, and upward wage pressures were quite modest. Sales of retail   items this holiday season were similar to or up slightly from last year, and   most business and consumer services gained. District manufacturing activity was   mixed across sectors but generally appeared to move up. Demand for agricultural   products increased, and extraction activity rose for providers of energy   resources. Housing demand trended up further, and conditions were largely stable   for commercial real estate. Contacts from financial institutions reported that   loan demand was unchanged or up somewhat, and credit quality improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures were limited on   balance during the reporting period. Price movements for energy items were   mixed: retail gasoline prices fell, and electricity prices rose in some areas.   Prices for some intermediate materials used in the construction sector, such as   drywall and steel rebar, ticked up, while log and pulp prices remained flat.   Prices of grapes and nuts increased, and higher prices for grains and corn due   to the drought earlier in the year boosted prices of grocery dairy and meat   items. A restaurant chain reported menu price increases in the 2 to 3 percent   range.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in most sectors reported that upward wage pressures were modest.   Limited hiring plans and ready worker availability in most sectors and regions   have held down increases in wages and compensation. However, wages increased for   some information technology workers who possess advanced skills and are in low   supply. The market for technically trained workers for the petroleum industry   remains tight. A few contacts expect wage hikes in 2013 in response to the   expiration of multiyear, company-wide salary freezes. Health-care benefit cost   increases are expected to accelerate and outpace wage increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were on a par with   or up slightly from last year's holiday season, but generally did not meet   vendors' expectations. Online retailers experienced more robust sales growth   than traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Inventories generally were at or   near desired levels given the pace of sales, although some retailers reported   having an excess of winter apparel due to relatively mild weather conditions,   while others ran short on certain consumer technology products. Contacts in the   information technology sector indicated strong sales of newer hardware and   games, but relatively weak sales of established goods as well as some Internet   and digital media products. Both sales and margins were soft for grocers. New   automobile sales remained solid, running well above levels from 12 months   earlier, with year-end gains expected to be sizeable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for most business and consumer services rose. Contacts pointed to   solid sales of various technology services, due mostly to typical year-end   business spending increases. Revenues continued to expand for food service   providers. Tourism and travel activity in the District was robust, with strong   growth of visitor counts and spending reported in both Hawaii and Southern   California. However, demand for health-care services remained relatively weak,   with some reports of consumers continuing to opt out of elective procedures and   health-care providers having excess capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity was mixed   across sectors but expanded overall during the reporting period of mid-November   through December. With healthy demand for fuel efficient planes and a sustained   backlog of orders, production activity for commercial aircraft and parts has   been running well above levels from last year. Demand continued to grow at a   modest pace for pharmaceutical and wood product manufacturers. By contrast,   capacity utilization remained relatively low for manufacturers of technology   equipment, and defense manufacturers have been trimming payrolls due to expected   federal spending reductions. While demand for scrap metal remained somewhat weak   by historical standards, that for steel products used in automotive   manufacturing and in infrastructure and nonresidential construction improved.   Contacts indicated that production activity picked up at petroleum refineries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural   output gained further, and extraction activity of natural resources used for   energy production continued to expand. Demand for most crop and livestock   products continued to advance and was met in part through more intensive use of   capital equipment. Extraction activity expanded on balance for petroleum and   natural gas, and natural gas inventories remained at historically high levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing demand in the   District strengthened further, while demand for commercial real estate was   largely stable. Both prices and sales transactions of homes climbed in most   areas, stimulating continued growth in home construction activity. In some   regional markets, activity ratcheted up for higher-priced homes. Construction   activity for multifamily residential projects grew further, in response to   rising rents and tight availability of lower-priced homes. Demand for   nonresidential space was largely stable. However, contacts reported that in   select geographic areas of the District, substantial growth of technology firms   has boosted demand for office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts from financial   institutions reported that loan demand was unchanged or up somewhat. Business   loan demand was characterized as moderate. Banking contacts continued to   highlight ample liquidity and generally stiff competition among lenders to   provide credit to well-qualified business loan applicants, with community banks   facing increasing competition from larger national banks for small business   lending. Although owner-occupied commercial real estate financing is readily   available, banks in most regions remain reluctant to lend to real estate   investors outside of the multifamily residential sector. Contacts noted a slight   slowdown in IPO, venture capital, and private equity activity in the District's   technology, Internet, and digital media subsectors. Consumer lending expanded   further, primarily for automobile purchases and new or refinanced home   mortgages. Reports indicated that credit quality for both business and consumer   loans has continued to improve, albeit at a slow pace.
