      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Fourth District have shown little change since our   last report; overall activity is sluggish and the recovery remains fragile.   Reports from factories indicated that production was flat or up slightly, with   increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal demand. New home sales   proceeded at a slow pace, while commercial and industrial construction was very   sluggish. Financing remains a major issue for residential and commercial   builders. Sales by District retailers and auto dealers were generally flat.   Declines in coal production have leveled out, with oil and gas output holding   steady. Reports indicated little change in freight transport volume. Business   and consumer lending weakened further, while core deposits continued to   grow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large scale employment reductions have flattened out across most sectors,   with some companies recalling a small number of workers. Staffing firm   representatives reported an uptick in job openings across a wide spectrum of   industries. Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. We heard   many reports of fluctuating commodity prices, especially from manufacturers and   food producers. Otherwise, construction materials and product pricing were   relatively stable. Capital spending and inventories remain under very tight   control.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most reports from District factories showed   that production was flat or up slightly during the past six weeks, with   increases being attributed to new orders and seasonal demand. About half of our   contacts told us that production has increased moderately on a year-over-year   basis, while others said that factory output remains depressed when compared to   year-ago levels. Producers are uncertain about the near-term, and they expect   only modest improvements at best. Steel shipments were in line with   expectations, though volume reports varied widely. Contacts reporting increased   volume attributed it mainly to rebuilding auto inventories. Our steel contacts   expect slow growth and are uncertain about which industries will drive demand.   District auto production rose modestly during October on a month-over-month   basis. Increases are attributed to automakers continuing to restock dealer   inventories. Vehicle production (domestic and foreign nameplate) in the District   remains well below year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers reported that they have either completed rebalancing their   inventories or continue to cut back. Capacity utilization is holding steady, but   at rates substantially below pre-recession levels. While little incentive exists   to invest in capital projects at this time, about a third of our respondents   indicated that they would consider increasing spending in 2010 if warranted by   more favorable business conditions. We heard many reports of fluctuating   commodity prices, especially for metals. However, most affected manufacturers   held back on raising their own prices. On net, there was little change in   staffing levels, and wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports show there has been little change in   new home construction during the past six weeks, while sales on a year-over-year   basis are comparable or up slightly. Purchases of entry-level homes continue to   do relatively well, and builders reported some improvement in the move-up   category. Looking forward to 2010, contractors see new home construction   proceeding at a slow pace. Although builders are somewhat encouraged by the   extension of the first-time home buyer tax credit, all of our respondents   reported that banks are unwilling to lend any money, especially for spec houses.   While most builders have not increased list prices, they are moving away from   offering discounts. Construction material costs are steady. General contractors   continue to operate with skeleton crews, and many subcontractors are struggling   to stay in business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) construction continues to be very   sluggish, though activity in public works projects is relatively stable. Most of   our respondents said that business has fallen substantially on a year-over-year   basis. Inquiries are coming in at a slow pace, while several builders reported   having nearly depleted their backlogs. Looking forward, contractors involved in   public works projects are cautiously optimistic, while their C&amp;I   counterparts expect very slow activity through mid-2011. We continue to hear   numerous accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing, resulting in some   projects being postponed or cancelled. On net, there has been little change in   construction material costs. About half of our respondents reported reducing   employment as they pare down their backlogs. Many subcontractors are struggling   to find work and are contracting below cost just to stay busy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that   October sales were generally flat or showed a slight improvement. Results of a   year-over-year sales comparison were mixed, but tended toward the down side.   Consumers continue to focus on purchasing necessities rather than discretionary   items and are very price sensitive. Expectations going into 2010 are for sales   to remain flat or begin a slow upward trend. Vendor pricing has been relatively   stable, while we heard a few reports of rollbacks in store prices and only minor   promotional activity. Retail inventories continued on the lean side. Auto   dealers said that new-vehicle sales were flat in October and are much slower   since the cash-for-clunkers program (C4C) ended. Used-vehicle purchases were   characterized as good, if not better, than new-vehicle sales. Vehicle   inventories remain low but have improved somewhat since C4C ended. Most dealers   expect future sales to track seasonal trends, but at a lower level. Dealers   reported that incentives and promotions are less effective than earlier in the   year. Difficulty in obtaining financing remains a serious issue for buyers and   dealers. There has been little change in staffing levels other than seasonal   hiring by retailers and job losses at dealerships that closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business lending has flattened out or weakened   further across most industry sectors. Bankers experiencing increased loan volume   attributed it to refinancing existing debt from other institutions. Interest   rates and spreads were steady to slightly up. On the consumer side, conventional   loan demand was characterized as flat to down, while activity in the residential   mortgage market has tapered off a bit. Several of our contacts noted that the   share of new purchase mortgage applications is starting to grow. Core deposits   continued to experience growth, even though bankers say that they are no longer   competing on rates. Lending standards remain very tight, which may negatively   impact commercial real estate borrowers seeking to refinance. Reports on the   credit quality of business and consumer loan applicants were decidedly mixed.   Generally speaking, the number of delinquencies has leveled off or come down   somewhat, though several bankers are still seeing an upward trend in   delinquencies tied to commercial and residential real estate loans. About half   of our respondents said there has been some decline in the number of bank   employees, though most of it is through controlled attrition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Coal executives reported that the sharp decline in   production has flattened out; however, no upturn is expected during the next few   months due to large stockpiling and weak demand. Little change in oil and gas   output was cited, with production expected to remain steady or begin a slow   decline. Reports showed that prices received for oil were up a little, while   those for natural gas were down slightly due to abundant supplies. For the most   part, the cost of production equipment and materials has leveled off or dropped   slightly. Capital expenditures by coal producers remain negligible, while those   by oil and gas producers were close to plan. Employment in the oil and gas   industry held steady, while coal executives reported some additional workforce   reductions. Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport executives reported   little change in shipping volume since our last report, with most fluctuations   being attributed to seasonal factors. Profit margins remain under pressure. Most   of our contacts are uncertain about near-term activity and expect only modest   improvements in volume at best. Several noted that the industry needs to cut   additional capacity. Rising fuel prices were reported by a majority of trucking   companies; however, passing through the increases to customers has been met with   a mixed degree of success. Capital spending remains soft, though some pickup is   anticipated during 2010. Two trucking executives reported that they are   committed to purchasing replacement equipment during the next 12 months. On the   labor front, all hiring is for replacement only.
