      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        The economy in the Fourth District grew at a slow pace during the past six   weeks, with many of our contacts downgrading their near-term outlooks.   Manufacturers reported stable production but a decline in new orders and   backlogs. Freight transport volume trended slightly higher. Retailers said that   their sales were on or ahead of plan and new-car purchases increased. Energy   companies noted little change in output. New-home construction remains sluggish,   and inquiries made to nonresidential builders have dropped off. The demand for   business credit picked up, while consumer lending was weak.
       </p>
       <p>
        Modest increases   in payrolls were mainly limited to the manufacturing and energy sectors.   Staffing-firm representatives noted moderate growth in the number of new job   openings, with vacancies concentrated in technical occupations and healthcare.   Almost all openings were for experienced workers. Wage pressures are contained.   Prices for raw materials used by manufacturers and construction materials have   generally stabilized or declined slightly.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Production at District factories was stable   during the past six weeks, although reports indicated declines in new orders and   backlogs. Many of our contacts expect additional slowing in demand, which they   attributed to uncertainty and caution on the part of their customers. Almost all   steel producers and service centers reported that the weakening in shipping   volume that began during the second quarter has continued. However, some of our   contacts are looking for a pickup in new orders due to low supply chain   inventories. Steel shipments are being driven primarily by transportation- and   energy-related industries. District auto production decreased in July on a   month-over-month basis, due to normal seasonal retooling for model changeovers.   Year-over-year production also fell, but declines were limited to foreign   nameplates, as supply disruptions caused by events in Japan persist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers remain committed to their capital spending plans for 2011, with   half of our contacts expecting to increase outlays in the upcoming months   relative to prior-year levels. Little movement was seen in capacity utilization   rates. Reports on raw materials indicated that prices have stabilized or   declined slightly. Product pricing was fairly steady. Several of our respondents   expect steel prices to begin rising in the near future. Hiring continued at a   modest pace, with some manufacturers reporting difficulty in finding   high-skilled workers. Wage pressures are contained.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Single-family home construction remains at a   low level, with purchases mainly in the move-up buyer categories. Contractors   reported that a lack of confidence is keeping potential buyers on the   side-lines, even with mortgage interest rates at very low levels. A few of our   contacts noted that multi-family construction and remodeling now accounts for a   substantial part of their backlogs. Expectations call for little change in   residential building in the near term. List prices of new homes held steady,   while builders shifted away from discounting. The upward pressure on building   material prices that was seen in early summer has diminished. Two builders   reported some easing in credit restrictions for financing multi-family and spec   construction. Aggressive pricing on the part of subcontractors was widespread.   One contact reported that monies from the 2009 stimulus package earmarked for   home weatherization programs have been exhausted, which could lead to further   job cutbacks in residential construction. General contractors continue to work   with lean crews.
       </p>
       <p>
        Activity in nonresidential construction has weakened slightly since our last   report. Although the number of inquiries has dropped off, several builders noted   that they have recently added to their backlogs. One contractor reported that   the rising incidence of stop-work orders on federal projects is contributing to   marketplace uncertainty. Most construction was contracted with manufacturers,   energy producers, or for infrastructure projects. Looking forward, several of   our contacts remain cautiously optimistic, while others believe an industry   rebound will not occur until 2013. Building material prices were mainly steady.   Little change in construction payrolls was noted, while union negotiations led   to a small increase in wages. Accounts of subcontractors struggling to stay in   business were common.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Retailers reported that sales for the   period from early July through mid-August were on or ahead of plan, and that   transactions increased in single-digits relative to year-ago levels. Many of our   contacts said that rising sales included necessities and discretionary items,   especially for new and innovative products. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter,   most contacts expect their sales to rise in the low- to mid-single digits on a   year-over-year basis. However, grocers we spoke with anticipate little   improvement in sales volume for the remainder of this year. We continue to hear   about upward pressure on supplier prices, although it mainly affects meat and   dairy products and items produced from cotton. Retailers attributed some of the   pressure to higher costs for transportation, packaging, and certain commodities.   Grocers passed through the increases to their customers, while other retailers   were more selective in adjusting prices. Reports on profit margins were mixed.   Capital outlays remain on plan. Half of our contacts said that they are in the   process of expanding the number of their retail outlets. However, no change in   payrolls is expected at existing stores.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most auto dealers reported that new-vehicle sales from early July through   mid-August were higher than the previous six-week period. On a year-over-year   basis, vehicle purchases improved for almost all of our contacts, with a few   noting double-digit increases. Demand for fuel-efficient, less-expensive cars   continued to grow, although the market for smaller SUVs remains stable.   Inventories are still at low levels, especially for Japanese brands. Dealers are   cautious in their outlook due to uncertainty about the economy and the   availability of vehicles that consumers want to buy. Demand for used cars   remained fairly strong; however, scarce inventory is contributing to higher   prices. We heard a few reports of some easing in credit restrictions, while the   use of leasing continues to grow. Many dealers are in the process of initiating   factory-mandated programs for showroom upgrades and reimaging, and two contacts   said that they are expanding their current facilities. The number of dealers who   are hiring sales and service personnel has picked up slightly since our last   report.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Banking
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Overall demand for business loans showed a modest   improvement, with requests coming from a broad range of industries. Reports   indicated downward pressure on interest rates for business credit. Consumer   credit was driven by indirect auto lending and home equity lines of credit.   Other installment loan categories remained weak. Applications for residential   mortgages have picked up, with bankers citing falling interest rates as the   reason. Submissions were fairly mixed but leaned toward refinancing. Core   deposits continued to increase, driven by inflows from business customers.   Several bankers commented that the rate of growth in consumer deposits has   weakened. Credit standards were largely unchanged. Delinquencies declined across   all loan categories. No significant changes in employment levels were cited, and   little new hiring is expected in the near-term.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Energy
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Conventional oil and natural gas drilling and   production were stable during the past six weeks, while activity in Marcellus   and Utica shales continued to expand. Shale gas produced in Pennsylvania grew by   almost 60 percent in the first six months of 2011 relative to the prior   six-month period. Wellhead prices paid to independent producers declined   slightly. Little change in coal output is anticipated for the remainder of this   year. Rising demand for coal in overseas markets has been offset by a lessening   in demand from domestic utilities and production constraints due to increased   governmental oversight in permitting and environmental compliance. Spot prices   for coal increased between 1 percent and 3 percent. Capital outlays are on   target, with moderate increases projected by oil and gas companies in the   upcoming months for drilling new wells. The cost of production equipment and   materials was fairly stable; however, prices increased for tubular products and   tires. A modest rise in payrolls was reported.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Transportation
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Overall, freight transport volume   continued on a slight upward trend, although a few of our contacts characterized   volume over the past couple of months as inconsistent. As a result, they revised   their near-term growth projections down slightly. Several respondents have   successfully increased their shipping rates as customer contracts came up for   renewal. Prices for diesel fuel have been trending lower, while maintenance   costs are rising, especially for tires. Capital outlays have accelerated during   2011 relative to prior-year levels. Spending is mainly to replace aging   transport equipment and to support demand growth from energy customers. Hiring   has been largely for driver replacement; however, we heard two reports about   carriers adding capacity. Wage pressures are emerging due to a tightening of the   driver pool.
