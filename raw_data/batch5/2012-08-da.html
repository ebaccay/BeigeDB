      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy grew at a moderate pace over the past six weeks.   Manufacturing activity continued to expand, demand for business services   remained solid, and transportation services activity increased. Respondents said   retail sales edged up, while automobile sales held steady. The housing and   commercial real estate markets remained healthy. Financial firms noted softening   loan demand. Energy activity remained robust, and agricultural conditions   improved slightly. Employment levels were steady to slightly higher. Wage and   price pressures were modest. Most contacts noted that European debt issues and   the upcoming national elections added uncertainty to their outlooks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most contacts said prices held steady, although   some construction-related and vehicle manufacturers noted slight increases, and   accounting and staffing firms reported a modest rise in billing rates. Paper   product manufacturers and shipping firms noted plans to implement price   increases in the near term. Overall, input costs were flat to up during the   reporting period. Prices for scrap metal, steel and grains rose. Contacts   reported that the rising cost of labor and land prices have increased builders'   costs, and some were raising prices on new homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of WTI rose from $85 in early July to $94 in mid-August. Natural   gas prices remained depressed. The price of diesel and gasoline climbed about 30   cents, and prices of petrochemical products were flat to up over the reporting   period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Employment levels edged up or held steady at   most responding firms. Staffing firms reported demand softened slightly from   high levels and noted rising demand for mortgage refinance specialists, sales   professionals and plastic product manufacturing workers. Reports of slight   employment increases came from some automobile dealers, construction-related   products manufacturers, transportation equipment producers and transportation   service firms. A few respondents noted difficulty filling vacant positions   because of employment opportunities available in the energy sector, and contacts   reported delays in housing starts because of labor shortages. Wage pressures   remained minimal, although upward pressure was reported for construction   workers, truck drivers and accountants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Overall demand for construction-related   products held steady or edged up since the last report, but outlooks were   cautious. A cement producer noted that increased residential construction   activity, particularly in South Texas, had improved demand. Fabricated metals   producers noted an uptick in orders, largely stemming from both public   infrastructure projects and private construction activity such as high rise   residential buildings and warehouse facilities. Demand for primary metals was   steady over the past six weeks, and expectations were for business to remain   flat through year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      High-tech manufacturers said orders were flat to slightly up over the   reporting period. Contacts reported that conditions in the semiconductor   industry were better in the U.S. than in other parts of the world. This is   largely because U.S. production centers on logic devices that are experiencing   stronger demand than memory devices, which are primarily produced outside of the   U.S. Most respondents noted that increased uncertainty will likely be a drag on   demand through year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for paper products remained steady, although contacts were uncertain   about what will happen over the next few months, particularly with regard to   potential tax changes after the November election. Food producers said demand   experienced a seasonal increase over the past month, but sales were lower than a   year ago. Overall, transportation equipment manufacturers said demand was flat   to up over the past six weeks. Demand for aviation equipment held steady at low   levels. Outlooks were less optimistic compared with the last report partly due   to continued weakness in demand for parts and repair of existing aircraft. A   producer of recreational vehicles noted a pickup in sales, and an emergency   vehicle manufacturer reported continued strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemicals producers reported steady demand. Demand for PVC, tied to   residential construction, improved domestically, and exports continued to be a   major source of sales. Exports of caustic soda remained strong as U.S. prices   are very competitive due to lower electricity costs. Chlorine demand edged up,   while demand for propylene weakened. Gulf Coast refiners said operating rates   remained high at 90 percent. Robust export demand for gasoline and distillates   kept inventories low, and refiners' margins remained healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retail sales grew slightly over the   reporting period and were up from a year ago. Particular strength was seen in   sales of accessories, cosmetics and women's and children's apparel. Sales growth   in the Eleventh District remained stronger than the nation, on average,   according to two large retailers. Retailers expect a seasonal pickup in demand   in the fourth quarter, although sales will likely be down from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales were mostly flat since the last report, but were up from   year ago levels. Inventories were lighter than desired. Contacts said political   uncertainty was hampering consumer confidence, and outlooks were cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Staffing firms said demand slowed slightly over   the past six weeks. Still, activity remained at high levels and business was   stronger compared with last year. Outlooks remained positive, yet there was   concern among contacts about uncertainty stemming from the upcoming presidential   election. Accounting firms noted continued seasonal weakness in overall demand   but said activity related to the energy industry remained a bright spot, and   outlooks for energy-focused areas were particularly upbeat. Legal firms reported   a continued pickup in demand, with sustained strength in intellectual property   litigation, energy and real estate-related services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from transportation service firms suggested a slight increase in   activity. Trucking firms said cargo volumes increased over the reporting period,   partly due to more oil and gas-related business. Railroads said volumes   increased since the last report. Contacts noted shipments of two of the largest   categories for rail cargo--grain and coal--declined, while volumes for lumber,   petroleum products and motor vehicles increased. Container volumes and small   parcel shipments picked up during the reporting period, while air freight   activity declined in part due to a slowdown in international cargo volumes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Airlines noted slight softening in passenger demand in part due to   seasonality and a decline in travel to Europe. Demand for travel to Mexico   picked up, while travel to Latin America and Asia held steady. Domestic demand   remained strong for both leisure and business travel. Contacts expect weaker   passenger demand over the next few months but noted it will likely remain near   last year's levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Housing activity remained   strong since the last report. Contacts said sales of new and existing homes   continued at a good pace and were well above expectations. Builders noted strong   traffic and reported rising backlogs, while realtors said shrinking inventories   had led to price gains. Apartment demand remained strong, and contacts noted   rising construction activity as investors continue to be attracted to the   market. Housing outlooks remain positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office and industrial real estate fundamentals remained healthy over the past   six weeks. Leasing activity continued at a good pace and some contacts noted a   pick-up in property sales. Outlooks were optimistic but cautious. Since the last   report, there were a few signs that investors were becoming less aggressive in   pursuing commercial real estate deals, outside of multifamily.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Overall, loan demand softened somewhat   during the reporting period. Corporate lending activity remained weak, while   residential real estate loan demand rose strongly. Loan pricing remained   competitive and deposits continued to grow. The quality of outstanding loans   continued to improve slowly as nonperforming loans declined. Outlooks were   positive, but contacts expressed concern about European debt issues, new   regulations for community banks and the upcoming national elections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Respondents at energy-related firms said overall   activity remained at high levels, with long lead times and growing backlogs.   Drilling activity continued to shift from dry natural gas to oil and natural gas   liquids. While the shift has not affected overall activity levels, contacts   expect a plateau in the growth of rig activity through year-end, in part due to   recent weakness in the price of natural gas liquids. Oil-related activity   continues to be strong, and contacts expect continued improvement in offshore   drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Drought conditions improved slightly due to   scattered rainfall in July. Crops remained mostly in fair to good shape, with   the exception of dryland cotton crop in the Texas High Plains region which   suffered due to lack of moisture. Overall, crop conditions were much better than   a year ago. Drought in the Midwest has caused grain prices to climb sharply,   squeezing margins for ranchers by driving up feed costs for livestock.
