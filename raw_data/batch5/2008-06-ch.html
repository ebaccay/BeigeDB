      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the  Seventh District expanded in April and May, but at a slower pace than in the  previous reporting period.  Consumer  spending was sluggish, and labor market conditions weakened some, although they  continued to vary by industry and location.   Residential construction showed signs of stabilizing and nonresidential  construction steadily increased.   Manufacturing activity weakened slightly, but business conditions  remained solid.  Consumer lending  declined, while business lending remained strong.  Cost pressures from rising material and  energy prices increased significantly from the previous reporting period, while  wage pressures remained low.  Delays in planting crops led to expectations of small losses in yield.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending remained sluggish in April  and May.  Higher food and energy prices  coupled with a weakening labor market in some areas of the District limited  consumer demand.  Retail sales were  steady, but margins were squeezed for many retailers as low pricing power  combined with higher wholesale prices created a tough business environment. Gasoline  sales were down as was tourism and business travel.  As a result, activity in the hotel and food  service industries weakened considerably. Light vehicle sales also slowed, although  inventory levels remained at comfortable levels.  Dealers observed that the composition of  demand was increasingly shifting toward smaller, fuel efficient cars and used  vehicles as consumer budgets tightened and gasoline prices continued to move  higher.  Several contacts in this  industry also mentioned a decline in auto loan quality in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The pace of business spending was little changed from the  previous reporting period.  However,  several manufacturing contacts reported plans to take advantage of more  favorable terms of trade and avoid rising transportation costs by bringing back  production from overseas.  Employment  conditions in the District weakened slightly, with Michigan  and Wisconsin exhibiting larger  declines.  The demand for labor was weak  in the construction, retail trade, and hotel and food service industries.  Lay-offs were reported in the manufacturing, automotive, and financial services  industries.  Professional and business  services and health care remained bright spots for hiring, and the demand for  skilled labor remained strong as shortages of such workers continued to be  reported.  Staffing firms' billable hours  were stable from the 
  previous reporting period.   However, a contact in this industry continued to report unwillingness on  the part of small to mid-size clients to agree to longer term contracts due to  the uncertainty surrounding the current business environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The pace of  construction stabilized from the previous reporting period.  The decline in residential construction  slowed in April and May for much of the District, and several contacts  expressed the belief that it may be approaching a bottom for the Midwest.  Absorption rates of residential housing  remained low, but began to increase in many areas as cancellations declined and  prices showed signs of stabilizing.  However, credit availability for new developments remained tight, and many builders  continued to suffer losses on existing projects. Demand slowly returned to some  markets as inquiries were reported to have increased, particularly among  first-time home buyers.  However, many potential  buyers were finding it difficult to obtain a mortgage.  Nonresidential development and construction steadily  increased outside of Michigan,  reflecting mostly major infrastructure projects.  Several contacts noted that declining credit  availability for medium- and large-scale projects, such as hotels, was  significantly reducing the project pipeline and would be limiting growth going  forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity  in the District weakened slightly from the previous reporting period; but,  overall, business conditions remained favorable.  Activity continued to be robust in the  domestic steel industry.  Production was  running near full capacity and contacts in several downstream industries  reported limited availability of steel-related materials.  Demand for heavy machinery in areas such as  large-scale agriculture, oil and gas extraction, mining, and aircraft also  remained strong.  Export-oriented  industries continued to flourish, with many contacts citing advantageous terms  of trade. However, demand continued to be soft for manufacturers with close  ties to residential housing, particularly the building materials and home  appliance industries. Automakers reported domestic sales were below  expectations as price discounts were insufficient to move larger vehicles.  Contacts in the auto industry also expressed  concern about falling consumer confidence and the fact that activity was  approaching levels not seen for over twenty-five years. Production cuts have  been implemented, and it was reported that lost production from the recent  American Axle strike would not be made up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, credit market conditions in the District  were little changed from the previous reporting period.  Consumer loan demand continued to decline and  lenders marginally 
  tightened standards.  Loan quality, however, appeared to be stabilizing.  Home equity loans increased and home equity  lines of credit were flat, although both remained below levels typical for the  current pricing environment.  Mortgage refinancing  decreased and mortgage originations were low, and contacts reported that  lending remained concentrated among fixed-rate and conforming mortgage  products.  Business loan demand increased  slightly, particularly for commercial and industrial loans.  However, concerns about  the commercial real estate sector and the inability of banks to syndicate  these loans continued to limit the availability of credit to this market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Price and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Costs rose substantially  for a variety of inputs from the previous reporting period.  Rising costs for commodity and energy inputs  were cited by contacts in numerous industries, and there were several reports  of pass-through of the higher costs to other prices.  A contact in the financial services industry  noted that many commodity traders were extending positions out to five years in  anticipation of even higher commodity prices. Many contacts cited the rising  price of steel and related metals as a significant factor in their costs, with  one manufacturing contact noting that steel surcharges had surpassed the base  material costs.  Retailers reported that  they were finding it more difficult to limit the pass-through of higher wholesale  food and energy prices to consumers.   Rising fuel prices were also reported as contributing to higher  transportation costs and a reduction in labor mobility.  Conversely, a contact in the construction  industry reported that wallboard prices had declined to the degree that they no  longer covered production costs.  Wage  pressures were limited outside of the skilled labor positions that continue to  experience shortages and a report of union wage demands from some skilled  trades in the construction industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet and cool weather resulted in widespread planting  delays during April and May. Nonetheless, by the end of the reporting period corn  planting was nearing completion and soybean planting was well underway. As a  result, the emergence of corn and soybean plants was behind the normal pace in  most of the District. However, contacts expected relatively small losses in  yield, though some ground will require replanting. On the plus side, high  levels of subsoil moisture provide some insurance against drought this summer.  Corn prices drifted lower during the reporting period, while soybean prices  picked up again. These price movements and high input costs for corn held back  the shift toward extra corn acres. Milk, cattle, and hog prices 
  increased. Margins of livestock  producers remained tight due to rising feed costs, which also were reported to  be causing producers to pare back herds.
