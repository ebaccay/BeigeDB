      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic expansion in the Eleventh  District continued to soften in late April and May, although activity in  regions dominated by the energy industry remained robust. Businesses with  national sales reported that economic growth in Texas is stronger than in the rest of the  country.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales growth continued to be  weak, and service sector activity softened. Manufacturing was mixed but  improved some. Construction and real estate activity weakened further. Financial  service firms reported that loan demand is growing faster than deposits. Agricultural  activity improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside the energy industry, record high  costs are weighing heavily on profits and leading firms to be less optimistic  about the outlook for growth through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Higher  input prices, including those for energy, are pushing up production costs for  most products and services. Rising energy costs put upward price pressure on a  wide range of chemicals and plastics. Producers report high or rising prices  for most raw materials, including copper, coal, steel, titanium and aluminum. A  few producers are stockpiling materials to hedge against higher prices. Food  prices continued to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      These developments are putting upward  pressure on selling prices for many products, and some firms are struggling to  raise selling prices, increase fees or reduce costs to survive. In the near term,  retailers say competitive pressure will remain intense as weaker players go out  of business and liquidate inventory. However, retailers say sizable input cost  increases are projected and are expected to push up selling prices next year. Selling  prices remained soft for most materials used in residential construction because  demand is weak and inventories high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The  labor market remained relatively tight. There are still reports of difficulty  hiring and skill shortages, such as for engineers, mechanics and administrative  positions. There has been little change in wage pressures, with the notable  exception of increases for some truck drivers. However, some firms said they  have already experienced or anticipate upward pressure from lower income workers  who commute long distances and are being squeezed by high fuel costs. Several  industries noted an increase in health insurance costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Producers of materials used in home construction--such as brick, stone and  lumber--reported a slight uptick in activity, but overall demand remained weak  and significantly below last year. Inventory levels are high for some products,  and those manufacturers are cutting back on production and adjusting workforce  levels. While brisk and above year-ago levels, demand for commercial  construction materials continued to soften and is expected to steadily weaken.  High prices are damping sales for some metals. Fabricated metals producers say  smaller construction projects are going forward but big deals that require a  significant amount of leverage are not. Domestic steel sales are slowing, but there  is strong demand from outside the United States, and producers say it has become  more profitable to export than to sell domestically.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall semiconductor sales have been  flat over the past thirty days. Demand from Europe and Asia remained strong, but U.S. sales have been weak. Demand for  solar technology is hot, but much of the production is occurring overseas.  Semiconductor equipment producers say recent signs of stabilization suggest the  worst of the downturn in this cycle may be over.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of food products were  unchanged, although higher prices have changed the mix of products and  customers. Demand for transportation equipment remained strong, with good sales  to supply the defense, aircraft and energy industries. Improved margins and an  end to the maintenance season have led refiners to ramp up production and  capacity utilization. Chemical production has also increased. Weak domestic  demand has been partly offset by a surge in exports that has created a shipping  logjam. Export demand is strongest for chemicals, such as ethylene, that are domestically  produced with natural gas and have a cost advantage over oil-based production  in other parts of the world.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Gains in retail sales continued to be slower than last year.  Retailers said growth has been weaker than they hoped because high fuel costs  are limiting discretionary spending. Stores that extend credit reported a deterioration  in timely payments. Stimulus checks have increased spending at discount stores.  Contacts say shoppers are looking for value, and sales growth is expected to  remain weak for several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile  sales weakened slightly and remained below year-ago levels. Inventories have increased  for trucks and SUVs but are very low for fuel-efficient vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for temporary staffing services was flat over the past six weeks at  about the same level as a year ago. Orders were strongest for professional and  technical workers in IT, accounting, energy and engineering services. Activity  from the manufacturing sector edged up, but demand for entry level financial  services and commercial real estate have slowed some.
     </p>
     <p>
      Legal activity continued to be strong,  but the mix of work suggests slower economic activity. Real estate transactions  declined, but there has been an increase in litigation and bankruptcy work. Oil  and gas-related activity also remained brisk. The accounting industry reported  moderate sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising fuel costs are straining the  transportation industry. Intermodal shipping volumes continued at a level that  is softer than earlier this year and a year ago. Exports have increased but not  enough to offset the substantial decline in imports. Truckers say diesel prices  have become too high to be fully covered by fuel surcharges and, in some  instances, drivers have stopped their trucks or are leaving the industry. A few  manufacturers said a shortage of truckers has caused delayed shipments and  inventory buildup. The rate of contraction in small parcel cargo shipping is  slowing. Demand is stronger for leisure air travel than for business.  International travel is stronger than domestic. Air fares are rising, and some  carriers have reduced capacity in anticipation of reduced travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Housing activity continued to decline. New and existing home  sales fell further, and some builders are abandoning planned developments.  Existing home inventories inched up, but remained low enough to keep median  home prices from falling by much. Apartment demand was solid, but there is  increasing concern about oversupply in Houston and Austin, where construction  activity has spiked.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office  demand slowed, except in areas dominated by the energy industry, such as Houston and Fort Worth. Industrial demand continued to  weaken. Commercial construction levels are still high, but contacts say there  are few new projects being initiated because it is difficult to obtain  financing, particularly for large investments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Partly reflecting reduced credit availability at nonbank lenders, loan  demand at banks is growing faster than deposits, and banks have tightened  standards to increase interest rate spreads. Community banks reported a strong  increase in real estate loan requests because other lenders are no longer  funding these borrowers. Overall, past due loans remain low, and there has been  no significant decline in credit quality, although respondents expect  deterioration.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit growth has been weaker than desired,  and banks are turning to other sources of liquidity. Contacts reported some  improvement in bank funding in recent weeks, with more access to a broader  maturity range, but said conditions are not yet normal, and funding is  expensive. Respondents indicated that there currently is sufficient liquidity  to finance quality deals, but expressed some concern that this may not continue  into the future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Optimism  about high oil and natural gas prices has pushed drilling to the highest level  in 20 years. So far, supplies of equipment and services have been sufficient to  keep their price increases at bay.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Rain improved conditions in most areas, but poor moisture in the Texas High  Plains has led to lower projections for wheat yields. Livestock are in good condition.  Supplemental feeding continued in drier areas. High fuel and fertilizer costs  are leading farmers to plant soybeans instead of corn. Costs are rising, and  farmers hope prices will be favorable at harvest time. Producers say market volatility  has made it harder to use forward contracts to lock in crop prices.
