      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Second District's economy has continued to grow slowly since the last   report, while the labor market has generally been stable. Manufacturers report   that general business conditions and employment levels have been steady in   recent weeks but that they plan to add workers in the months ahead. Consumer   spending has continued to expand at a moderate pace: auto dealers report that   sales were steady to stronger in October, non-auto retail contacts report that   sales have been on or ahead of plan, and tourism activity has been generally   robust. Home sales and prices have generally held steady since the last report,   though rental markets continued to strengthen. Commercial real estate markets   have shown slight signs of softening. New York City financial firms continue to   face adverse business conditions and have announced impending layoffs. Finally,   bankers report a pickup in demand for commercial mortgage loans, continued   tightening in credit standards, and lower delinquency rates on commercial and   industrial loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Non-auto retailers report that same   store sales were mostly on or ahead of plan in October and the first half of   November but little changed from a year earlier. Contacts at major malls in   upstate New York indicate that sales activity was mixed in October but appeared   to improve in the early part of November. One large retail chain indicates that   sales in the region were down slightly from a year earlier in October and early   November but still somewhat ahead of plan. Retail inventories are generally said   to be at desired levels, while prices are reported to be flat to down slightly.   Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales were steady to stronger in   October and that dealers' service and parts departments continue to perform   well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer confidence has weakened noticeably since the last report. Both Siena   College's October survey of New York State residents and the Conference Board's   survey covering the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) show consumer confidence   falling to its lowest level in more than a year. Tourism activity has been   generally robust since the last report. Albany-area hotels report strong   improvement in occupancy rates in September. New York City hotels report that   occupancy rates were steady at about 90 percent in September and October--up   modestly from 2010 levels; room rates were up roughly 4 percent from a year   earlier in October and total revenues were up about 6 percent. However, Broadway   theaters report that attendance fell 5-10 percent below year ago levels in   October and early November--in part reflecting fewer shows open this year.   Still, total revenues have continued to run ahead of 2010 levels, reflecting   double-digit percentage increases in revenues per show.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate   markets have been stable, on balance, since the last report, while home   construction activity remains low--particularly for single-family homes. New   York City's rental market continues to strengthen: asking rents remained on an   upward trend up in October and were up 5 to 10 percent from comparable 2010   levels. Scattered reports from elsewhere in the District also point to   strengthening rental markets. Co-op and condo prices in Manhattan and Brooklyn   were mostly steady since the last report, while transactions activity dipped in   October but turned up in early November. In northern New Jersey, home prices are   reported to be down modestly, hampered by a glut of distressed properties; while   fewer home mortgages are moving into delinquency status recently, there remains   a large overhang of distressed properties. New home construction remains at a   low level, with multi-family rental buildings accounting for most new   development--in both New York City and northern New Jersey. Buffalo-area   Realtors report steady home sales activity but some downward drift in prices;   they also note a pickup in traffic at open houses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets have been steady to slightly weaker since the   last report. Office vacancy rates in both midtown and downtown Manhattan ticked   up in October; the average asking rent continued to climb, but this is   attributed to the fact that much of the space recently coming on the market is   in high-priced buildings. A contact in western New York State reports that   commercial leasing activity remains flat, while commercial construction activity   has picked up slightly but remains sluggish; credit availability continues to be   a restraining factor for the market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       According to an industry contact,   financial sector conditions remain adverse, with several thousand layoffs   reportedly in the pipeline in the New York City area. This contact notes that   regulatory uncertainty is hampering planning and causing shifts in resources   among areas. While securities firms are reducing headcounts overall, they are   still hiring in the legal and compliance areas. A major New York City employment   agency reports that the job market has held steady since the last report with   hiring activity described as moderate in October. Starting salaries have   remained stable over the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both manufacturers and service-sector firms continue to report stable   employment levels but indicate plans to increase headcounts, on balance, over   the next six months. Manufacturing firms across New York State report that   general business conditions have held steady over the past month, and they   express increased optimism about the near term outlook. Non-manufacturing   contacts are also increasingly optimistic about the near-term outlook, though   less so than manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Small to medium-sized banks in the   District report increased demand for commercial mortgages but no change in   demand in other loan categories. Bankers also reported an increase in the demand   for refinancing. Respondents report tightening credit standards in all   categories except residential mortgages, for which they indicate no change.   Tightening of standards was most prevalent for commercial mortgages. Contacts   report decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan   categories. Respondents also indicate widespread decreases in average deposit   rates. Bankers report declining delinquency rates for commercial and industrial   loans, but no change in delinquencies for the other loan categories.
