      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded at a moderate pace during 
  late August and September. Consumer spending continued to increase modestly, 
  and business spending expanded again. Labor market conditions were little changed, 
  with small gains in employment on net. Residential construction and real estate 
  activity declined again in most areas, while nonresidential construction advanced 
  at a steady pace. Manufacturing activity expanded again, though at a modestly 
  slower pace than in the previous reporting period. Mortgage lending declined, 
  while commercial lending increased at a slightly slower rate than in the previous 
  reporting period. Nonenergy price pressures and overall wage increases held 
  steady. Corn and soybean harvests in the District were delayed by cool and rainy 
  weather in September, and early results indicated mixed yields relative to a 
  year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to increase modestly in August and September. Retailers 
  said back-to-school sales were within their expectations but "nothing 
  stellar." Cool weather reportedly helped apparel sales in some areas. 
  Retailers thought that lower gasoline prices had only a modest impact on their 
  sales. Retail inventories were at desired levels for general merchandisers, 
  but a furniture retailer said it was running down its inventories because its 
  suppliers were well stocked and able to fill orders quickly. Auto dealers reported 
  that sales trends have changed little in recent weeks; Big Three vehicles lagged 
  behind foreign nameplates and high-gas-mileage vehicles continued to sell well. 
  Tourism in Michigan was running similar to a year ago after a small pick-up 
  in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending and hiring expanded again in the District. For the most part, 
  capital spending continued to increase at similar rates as in the previous reporting 
  period. Trucking volumes were up slightly over a year earlier, though one contact 
  said customers have been tentative and saw a chance of stronger activity in 
  the fourth quarter. Overall labor market conditions were little changed, with 
  small gains in employment on net. Manufacturing employment was mixed by industry. 
  Auto manufacturers and suppliers laid off workers, while toolmakers increased 
  employment. A contact in Rockford reported that a number of warehouses serving 
  retailers were significantly increasing employment. A local internet job posting 
  business said that job advertising continues to be robust. Shortages of skilled 
  manufacturing workers persisted. A temporary help services provider said that 
  demand growth in the District during the third quarter was a bit stronger than 
  the second quarter, led by a pickup in Illinois and Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction/real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and real estate activity declined again in most areas. 
  Homebuilders observed sluggish demand in all market segments, and a Chicago-area 
  builder said high-end properties have been taking noticeably longer to sell. 
  However, a contact in the Milwaukee area said traffic through model homes was 
  holding up well. Builders in southeast Michigan reported a number of project 
  cancellations. New home prices were steady to down, and several builders were 
  adding free upgrades to help sell homes. A contact in Michigan noted that list 
  prices of existing homes were being reduced as well. Nonresidential construction 
  expanded at a steady pace. However, net absorption of office space slowed and 
  neared zero in many parts of the District, which a Chicago-area contact attributed 
  to the return of sublease space into the market. Looking forward, a few contacts 
  said that the development pipeline looked slower than average and that some 
  projects were delayed for budget reasons.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded again in late August and September, though the 
  pace of expansion was a bit slower than in the previous reporting period. Sales 
  of large- and medium-sized heavy equipment continued to be strong, but overall 
  order backlogs dipped below recent highs and deliveries of machines used in 
  home construction have fallen below year-ago levels. Sales of high-tech equipment 
  were growing well, with demand spread across cell phones, cellular infrastructure, 
  and defense communication equipment. A specialty steel producer reported robust 
  order growth and said that it was picking up new customers that had been having 
  trouble filling orders with their existing supply base. Toolmakers reported 
  continued strong order growth. One toolmaker added that it had not seen any 
  weakening in its oil-related business since crude prices have declined, and 
  another noted that demand from foreign firms has been strong. Heavy-duty truck 
  production and sales were at record levels. Net orders continued to fall, but 
  the decline was within expectations since production capacity was booked through 
  the end of the year, when new emission standards go into effect. Demand for 
  medium-duty trucks was driven by orders from truck dealers, as analysts report 
  that end-users were "clueless" about the new emission standards. 
  Light vehicle manufacturers forecast steady or slightly slower sales for the 
  rest of the year, though one expected lower gasoline prices and higher equity 
  prices to support demand. A steelmaker noted that vehicle production cuts were 
  starting to show through in weakening orders for flat-rolled steel and growing 
  inventories at steel service centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking/finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity moderated further. Bankers noted continued stagnation in mortgage 
  applications for home purchases but said that refinancing activity firmed between 
  August and September. One bank indicated that slower home price appreciation 
  was restraining demand for new home equity loans. Home equity credit line balances 
  declined further, though demand for closed-end loans ticked up. Household credit 
  quality remained in good shape in most places with stable delinquency rates 
  on mortgages and home equity loans; the exception was in Michigan, where delinquency 
  rates moved higher. Commercial lending continued to expand but at a slightly 
  slower pace than in recent reporting periods. Bankers in the Chicago area noted 
  that customers remained upbeat about business conditions and were increasing 
  their demand for financing, while bankers in Michigan reported little loan growth. 
  Commercial lending conditions continued to be competitive and interest rate 
  margins were narrow. One banker noted that competitive pressures were spreading 
  into second-tier lending, such as small business loans collateralized with personal 
  assets. Commercial credit quality remained in good shape, which one Detroit-area 
  banker attributed to the reluctance of lending officers to loan funds to problem 
  industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices/costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonenergy price pressures and overall wage increases were similar as in the 
  previous reporting period. Several contacts reported recent declines in energy 
  costs, but a manufacturer said their suppliers were waiting to make sure energy 
  prices stabilized before passing along the cost reductions. An appliance manufacturer 
  said the cost environment remained "unfavorable," due to high materials 
  prices. Construction materials costs were stabilizing at high levels. There 
  were no reports of significant changes in price movements at the retail level. 
  Wage increases continued at similar rates as in the previous reporting period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Corn and soybean harvests in most of the District were delayed by continued 
  precipitation and unseasonably cool weather. The weather also inhibited crops 
  from drying in the fields, forcing farmers to use energy-intensive, mechanical 
  drying. Early reports on corn and soybean yields indicated mixed results around 
  the District, as extensive cloud cover late in the growing season hampered crop 
  development. Net crop receipts decreased across the District. Contacts expressed 
  concern about cash flows for grain farmers given higher operating costs for 
  the crop year overall, though the recent decline in energy prices has been a 
  positive factor, especially by reducing the cost of drying grain. Hog prices 
  declined in September, while cattle and dairy prices increased.
