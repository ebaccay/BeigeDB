      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the First District continues to expand. With the   exception of real estate, business contacts are generally upbeat about recent   results, reporting similar or better growth than in the last couple of reports.   Commercial and residential real estate markets are not much changed, with   respondents citing weak but not disastrous conditions. While staffing firms note   increased demand for labor, contacts in retail and manufacturing say they are   hiring only modestly and plan limited pay raises. With a few exceptions, price   pressures appear to have abated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retailers responding in   this round report that business conditions in early 2012 have continued the   improvement seen in the fourth quarter. Contacts ending their fiscal year in   late December or early January say that fiscal 2011 sales ranged from down 2   percent to up 5 percent compared to 2010. These results are generally better   than they expected at the start of 2011 and reflect strong same-store sales in   the last few months of 2011 as compared to earlier in the year; indeed, December   2011 same-store sales ranged from high single-digit increases year-over-year to   mid-teen increases. The range of results was wider in January 2012: One retailer   reports same-store sales were down 8 percent to 9 percent year-over-year, which   he attributes to mild weather depressing demand for winter hardware items as   compared to a particularly snowy January 2011. Another saw January   comparable-store sales up 7 percent compared to a year ago, and a third   respondent enjoyed a 17 percent jump, which he credits in part to the mild   winter not keeping customers at home. All contacts note that store traffic is   up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Responding retailers report that furniture is selling very well, as is paint.   As noted above, the mild winter has depressed sales of some seasonal items, and   one retailer has steeply discounted winter clothing to get rid of inventory.   Prices on furniture are generally flat, but retailers expect the cost of items   made with copper or titanium oxide (paint) to reflect price increases in these   commodities. Stores are doing light hiring for some full-time and part-time   positions; they are budgeting 2012 merit pay increases between 2 and 3 percent.   Retail respondents expect the U.S. economy to improve further in 2012. While   remaining a bit cautious, they all note that economic conditions seem more   favorable than last fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   conditions in the First District appear to have improved since the end of last   year. All respondents in this cycle report sales growth in the fourth quarter   from a year earlier. Although many contacts express serious concerns about the   situation in Europe, only two say that sales to Europe were actually down. In   contrast to the last two rounds, this time few contacts mention weakness in   Asia. Contacts among defense suppliers express concern about the budget. One had   concluded that programs his firm worked on were largely insulated from cuts but   said they are "having trouble convincing our investors of that." Another said   that budget issues are leading to delays but not to reductions in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Raw material prices have stabilized overall but remain an issue. On the one   hand, a plumbing manufacturer said that copper is "on the march again." On the   other hand, low natural gas prices have been a boon to U.S. industry. A contact   in the industrial membrane industry reports that a multimillion dollar project   to switch to natural gas has already led to millions of dollars in savings. A   petrochemical contact points out that the equivalent price of natural gas in   terms of oil is approximately $25 a barrel, making the U.S. a low cost producer   of petrochemicals; as he put it, we are "exporting natural gas in the form of   ethylene and polyethylene."
     </p>
     <p>
      All of our manufacturing contacts are increasing investment and none cites   any issues finding financing. Remarkably, almost all of our contacts say they   have acquired at least one company over the last six months. Almost all   responding manufacturers report increased employment and there are fewer   complaints about difficulties finding qualified workers than in the past; at the   same time, an equipment manufacturer is spending significant sums on training   expenses for new hires. A pharmaceutical firm closed a facility in Philadelphia   and offered jobs in Massachusetts to 20 employees, but reports that only six   accepted, suggesting confidence in the availability of employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Europe is a source of considerable concern but has not yet affected our   contacts in a significant way. Two respondents report slower sales in Europe and   one, a plumbing manufacturer, says Europe is "in a recession." Another contact   revised down their sales growth forecast for 2012 by 2 percentage points to 4   percent to 5 percent--with the subtraction attributed to weakness in Europe--but   at the same time indicated the risks had shifted to the upside.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Software and Information Technology Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First   District software and information technology services contacts report that the   upward trends of early 2011 continued through Q4 2011 and into Q1 2012.   Year-over-year revenue increases in the fourth quarter, ranging from 10 percent   to over 25 percent, were generally on par with those seen in the third quarter.   Contacts report upticks in demand across a number of sectors and geographies,   with a few noting that activity in Europe exceeds their expectations. Growing   workloads have led most contacts to continue to add to their headcounts. Indeed,   one contact is on track to expand its workforce by over 20 percent in 2012;   another, by contrast, reports a modest decrease, with a number of management   positions being eliminated in an ongoing realignment. Two contacts say they have   increased capital and technology spending relative to a year ago in order to   build office space in Massachusetts. Prices are holding steady, with contacts   reporting little to no downward pressure. The outlook among software and IT   contacts is not appreciably different from that of three months ago; most are   cautiously optimistic and expect revenue growth in 2012 to be in the range of 10   percent to 20 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Staffing Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England staffing firms generally   experienced a better-than-usual holiday season in 2011, with business picking up   steam in early 2012. However, year-over-year revenue changes in the fourth   quarter varied widely, from flat to up more than 25 percent. Labor demand is   higher than three months ago, although a few contacts report signs of slowing in   the light industrial sector. The growth in demand for permanent and   temporary-to-permanent hiring has accelerated in recent months, with one contact   noting that "clients are definitely ready to hire permanent employees."   Notwithstanding stronger demand, the hiring cycle remains elongated, and   high-end skill sets are still difficult to find. Bill rates and pay rates have   gone largely unchanged since November but remain above their year-earlier   levels. Looking forward, New England staffing contacts are generally more upbeat   than they were three and six months ago, with many expecting their rate of   growth to pick up through the end of 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate contacts   around New England describe leasing fundamentals as largely unchanged since the   last report, although some note modest positive developments. One Boston contact   reports that some tenants are increasingly willing to pay top dollar for prime   office space in Boston's Back Bay, but cautions that such instances do not   necessarily reflect a broad-based increase in office demand in greater Boston.   Another Boston contact describes the city's office leasing market as mostly   flat, but grants that rents may have increased marginally in recent months. A   Providence contact is more upbeat, noting a healthy increase in deal volume and   significant office absorption since the last report. By contrast, office leasing   volume slowed somewhat in both Portland and Hartford relative to December. For   retail space, Hartford's vacancy rate held up better than expected despite weak   holiday sales at some large chains, while in Portland some long-vacant retail   properties have seen a rise in inquiries by potential tenants. Greater   Hartford's industrial market also saw a modest uptick in tenant inquiries in   recent weeks, including signs of life in the area's moribund warehousing and   distribution sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Boston continues to experience a surge of multifamily construction activity,   with several large projects under way and more in the planning stages. Financing   for such projects is available on attractive terms, with interest rates dipping   below 4 percent in some cases. While investors and lenders are bullish on the   multifamily sector and apartment rents have risen significantly in Boston in the   past year, some contacts see a risk of overbuilding. Boston's science and   technology sector is generating significant build-to-suit construction of   laboratory/office space. At the same time, speculative office construction   remains non-existent across the area, and one contact estimates that office   vacancy rates would have to fall below 4 percent in Boston to warrant the   creation of new office structures. While office construction is limited, the   investment sales market for prime Boston office properties remains robust amid a   highly liquid financing environment. Echoing similar comments in recent reports,   however, some contacts perceive that sales prices for prime Boston office   properties are too high in relation to expected fundamentals.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among contacts is tilted toward optimism. One Boston contact   continues to expect only very slow improvement in leasing fundamentals in 2012,   while another sees greater upside potential. Another contact expects Boston's   multifamily construction boom to last another two to three years, but beyond   that sees few prospects for any new construction activity. Our Providence   contact expects solid improvement in fundamentals in 2012, barring risks to   growth from local fiscal troubles and a possible spike in oil prices. The   outlook in Hartford is moderately optimistic, but based more on sentiment than   recent data. Portland's commercial market is expected to improve slowly in 2012,   although prime office properties may see more robust gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of single-family homes and   condominiums increased in New England in January, with most reports indicating   low to moderate growth in sales compared to a year ago. Contacts say recent   sales growth reflects market activity more accurately than in previous reports,   when year-over-year increases were distorted by the expiration of the tax credit   in mid-2010. Meanwhile, the median sale price of homes in First District markets   declined compared to a year ago, which contacts attribute to distressed property   sales. Concerns surrounding the impact of labor market conditions on housing   demand have abated slightly. Respondents note foreclosures and delinquencies   continue to affect the housing market significantly, but say these factors play   less of a role in New England than in other parts of the country. Contacts   expect low mortgage rates and improving employment outlooks to help fuel buyer   activity. In the Greater Boston area, rent pressures coupled with low interest   rates may push more buyers into the home and condo market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts expect to see continued year-over-year growth in home sales in the   region, but do not anticipate significant improvements in the near term, with   prices remaining flat at best. Contacts also note that exceptionally mild winter   weather may prompt spring sales activity to begin earlier than usual.
