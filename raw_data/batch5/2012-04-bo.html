      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace in the First District.   Most contacted retailers, manufacturers, and consulting and advertising firms   report higher revenues in recent months than a year earlier. Commercial real   estate markets are mostly unchanged, while residential contacts across the   region cite rising sales and declining prices. Except for a consulting firm   unable to meet very strong demand growth without aggressive hiring, responding   firms are hiring modestly or not at all; a few mentioned small layoffs.   Retailers express concern about what rising energy costs may do to consumers'   willingness to spend, while manufacturing contacts acknowledge the increasing   costs, but say they are not a problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most First District retail contacts   characterize year-to-date 2012 performance as strong, attributing this strength   to mild winter weather and improving consumer sentiment. For February,   year-over-year comparable-store sales increases ranged from low to high single   digits, with the exception of one retailer citing a 23 percent rise. Furniture   continues to sell well in the First District, as does apparel and other   household items. Paper-based products are expected to see 3 percent to 4 percent   price increases. While respondents are optimistic that performance will continue   to be good, they remain cautious, noting that gasoline price increases might   damp consumer sentiment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The travel and tourism sector in the First District continues to expect a   strong 2012, based on 5.6 percent annual growth in 2011, a strong start to 2012,   and analyst forecasts predicting high single-digit to low double-digit increases   over 2011. In January and February, hotel revenues were up nearly 10 percent,   reflecting improved occupancy rates. Higher hotel occupancy has positive   spillover effects for restaurants, retail, and entertainment venues. Business   travel is driving this increase, as leisure travel is still subject to some   consumer caution. Echoing the retail contacts, tourism contacts say higher gas   prices could retard growth in leisure travel, but aggressive price discounting   might provide a counterweight.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      None of the 10 First   District manufacturing firms contacted this round saw year-over-year sales   declines in recent months, but performance varied. A semiconductor machinery   manufacturer which generates most of its sales in Asia reports flat sales in the   first two months of 2012, an improvement over declining sales in the fourth   quarter of 2011. By contrast, an information technology equipment provider cites   18 percent sales growth in 2011 and continued strong growth in the first quarter   of 2012. Geography matters, as firms with large operations in Europe saw slower   growth and some outright overseas declines whereas firms more focused on the   U.S. and Asia experienced better results. A contact in the information   technology sector argues that the end of 2011 was strong because customers held   back on spending during the weak spring and summer period but then made sure to   spend that money before the year ended.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of our contacts report that input costs and, in particular, energy costs   are up. However, none says rising costs are a problem and all in this round say   energy has little noticeable effect on their costs or revenues. In general,   respondents indicate they are hiring to keep up with demand. Two firms undertook   relatively small layoffs; one did so because of weaker sales in the fourth   quarter of 2012 and the other is offsetting layoffs at one New England plant   with increases elsewhere in the region. Firms continue to report difficulty   finding qualified workers, especially in skilled manufacturing trades and   engineering. One contact, an electrical equipment manufacturer, is trying to   re-orient recruiting to hire young engineers, for example, and train them   in-house, rather than continuing to search for workers who already have   experience with the relevant technology.
     </p>
     <p>
      None of the contacted firms has revised its outlook since our last   conversations earlier this year or in the closing months of 2011. Most appear to   expect U.S. economic growth around 2 percent in 2012 and company sales growth in   the low single digits. Contacts remain concerned about the European economy and   about political "gridlock" here. A few contacts also expressed slight concern   about prospects for growth in China.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Selected Business Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consulting and advertising   contacts in the First District report increasing revenues in the first quarter   of 2012 and most say that the pace of growth, while not rapid, is sustainable.   Despite the fact that recent growth is generally slower than at the end of 2011,   contacts are relatively upbeat, partly because the faster growth of late 2011   represented a recovery from a very weak third quarter, in which several contacts   experienced declining revenues and laid off workers. Revenue results, while good   for marketing and advertising firms, are stronger for consulting firms,   especially economic consulting. A firm that focuses on marketing and promotional   materials saw year-over-year growth of about 10 percent while another that   focuses on advertising cites stable revenues recently after rapid growth in the   latter half of 2011. Strategy and business consulting contacts report growth   around 5 percent, as clients who had previously been sitting on large stockpiles   of cash are beginning to spend them to address pent-up need for consulting   services cut during the recession. Clients have reportedly begun to focus on   increasing sales and positioning themselves within markets rather than solely on   cutting costs. Economic consulting contacts note that demand is extremely strong   for high-end consulting and revenue growth is limited mostly by their own   capacity to respond. Demand for health care consulting is generally strong, with   the exception of pharmaceuticals, but some business lines have slowed as firms   wait until the uncertainty over health care reform clears up. One consulting   firm has seen rapid growth due to two new large government contracts, but notes   that individual consulting firms' prospects are contingent upon the funding   status of and uncertainty surrounding the specific agencies with which they do   business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts report wage increases in the low single digits and expect this pace   to continue. Input costs consist primarily of salaries in this sector, but other   cost growth is generally low. Firms say they are able to pass on cost increases   to clients and thus see either steady or slightly increasing profit margins.   Responding firms say they changed employment levels very little in the first   quarter of 2012, except for economic consultants who are hiring to meet demand   growth, and a strategic and management consultant with small layoffs. Aside from   economic consulting, contacts do not plan to expand headcounts in the near   future, requiring more rapid increases in demand to reinitiate hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts expect moderate growth for the rest of 2012, with some   anticipating an acceleration either late in the year or in 2013. They note very   few downside risks, saying their biggest concerns are the macro economy in   general and uncertainty surrounding partisanship in Washington and the upcoming   election.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from commercial real   estate contacts in the First District indicate that conditions are largely   unchanged since the last report. Boston's commercial property market remains   more active than other New England markets, which are "quiet," a term one   contact used to describe Portland. Contacts note that investment demand for   prime office and apartment properties continues to be robust in Boston and   expect it to remain so for the foreseeable future. Office and retail demand   elsewhere in New England is moderate. Contacts in these areas do not foresee   increases in vacancy rates, but note that a dearth of interest from potential   entrants to these markets means they are unlikely to fall in the near future.   Retail sector rents remain flat across the region and all contacts reported   retail sector vacancy rates somewhere between flat and modestly decreasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity continues at moderate levels in Boston and low levels   elsewhere in the District. One contact perceives an increased interest in new   retail and medical office projects in Boston for the first time in recent   history. Another contact expects education sector construction activity in the   Boston area to increase later in the year, but notes that large health care   projects continue to be delayed. Market appetites for multifamily apartment   development remain strong in Boston. According to contacts, favorable terms but   strict standards characterize financing markets for construction projects in   Boston and financing conditions in Boston remain markedly better than in the   region's smaller markets. Respondents throughout the region remain cautiously   optimistic about the coming months, but many acknowledge that commercial markets   will not begin to pick up until macroeconomic conditions improve substantially.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate in New   England shows signs of strengthening as sales continued to increase in February,   except in Connecticut where February sales were close to year-earlier levels.   According to most contacts, activity is improving across all price segments.   Contacts cite low interest rates, falling prices, improving economic conditions,   and milder weather as factors contributing to the observed sales increases.   Nonetheless, contacts remain cautious about the prospect of housing-market   recovery because home prices continued to decline across the six states. Most   contacts attribute falling prices to distressed properties; however, they also   say the role of distressed properties in the market is diminishing. In the   Greater Boston area, by contrast, the median sale price of homes and condos rose   in February compared to a year ago. Respondents say buyer activity in Boston has   intensified and they are concerned that inventory levels will not provide   adequate selection for homebuyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in states with significant levels of inventory remain cautiously   optimistic about the near future; they say sales growth observed in recent   months appears promising, but declining prices remain a source of concern. Other   contacts maintain a more optimistic outlook for coming months due to inventory   levels coming into balance with buyer activity. Based on pending sales figures   and current market activity, contacts expect growth in year-over-year sales to   continue into spring.
