      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to improve, but the rate   of improvement slowed from April to May. Manufacturing continued to lead the   way, and consumer and business spending also increased further. Construction   activity improved slightly on the basis of increases in residential and public   building. However, the gains in all of these sectors in May were somewhat slower   than in April. Price pressures remained limited. Crop conditions were slightly   better than normal for this time of year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased in April   and May. Though contacts noted smaller gains than during the previous reporting   period, they attributed most of the slowdown to the early Easter holiday drawing   sales into March. Noticeable increases were seen in the home improvement and   lawn and garden categories as consumers prepared for summer. Auto sales also   continued to rise as buyers returned to showrooms to take advantage of favorable   price and credit terms. In addition, the pace of tourism activity increased with   warmer weather and lower hotel rates boosting demand. Retail contacts indicated   that recent increases in income should translate into higher sales with the   momentum carrying forward into the fall season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rise in business spending moderated   from the previous reporting period. Inventory investment slowed. Contacts expect   that manufacturers' will do only marginal restocking in the remainder of 2010,   while retailers will rebuild inventories at least through fall. Labor market   conditions improved. Contacts noted increasing signs that employment gains could   be stronger in the second half of 2010. For example, they are seeing more job   advertisements in categories associated with companies that are expanding   employment. By sector, manufacturers continued to hire to fill skill-based needs   and make use of previously idle capacity; and a large staffing firm reported   billable hours rose in large part due to increasingly higher demand for   industrial workers. Labor demand in professional and business services and   retail trade also increased. Unemployment in the District remained above the   national rate, with the average duration increasing. However, a contact noted   that recently unemployed workers were re-entering the labor force more quickly   than the previously unemployed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity   improved slightly from the previous reporting period. Residential building   benefitted to some degree from the homebuyer tax credit that expired in April,   but contacts noted that activity pulled back in May. They expect construction in   2010 as a whole to be just slightly better than in 2009. New residential   development remained minimal. Contacts indicated tight credit combined with the   overhang of existing unimproved and distressed lots are likely to deter   development for an extended period. Single-family home prices held steady, but   downward pricing pressure continued to be strong for condominiums. Private   nonresidential construction remained weak, as the elevated inventory of vacant   industrial and retail properties continued to hold back demand for new   construction. Public construction, however, increased with contacts noting more   activity in highway, education, and medical projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity was strong in April   led by the automotive, energy, medical, and consumer goods industries, but the   rise in production softened some in May. With sales holding up in recent months,   a contact in the auto industry indicated that production was running at a steady   pace. Capacity utilization in the steel industry leveled off, and a contact   indicated that it was likely to stay around its current level for the next   3-to-4 months as the pace of inventory replenishment slows. For example, more   manufacturers of industrial metals noted that they were buying only what   material they could immediately manufacture and sell. In contrast, demand for   heavy equipment was indicated to be finally turning a corner; dealers were   rebuilding inventories and have seen a significant increase in demand for   rent-to-sell fleets. Mining and agricultural equipment sales remained stronger   than for construction equipment. Contacts indicated that the pipeline for the   export of capital equipment abroad, particularly to Asia and South America,   remains robust. The increase in residential construction in April led to an   increase in activity for housing-related manufacturers with shipments of   wallboard in the District up slightly as a result.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions improved, on   balance, in April and May. Volatility increased across financial markets, and   short-term lending and corporate credit spreads widened due in part to the   uncertainty surrounding Europe's fiscal crisis. However, a contact noted that   the financial system now has "more cushion" to absorb the higher cost of credit   given the ongoing improvement in U.S. economic conditions. In a sign of this   effect, banking contacts again reported better loan quality. Lending,   particularly among large banks, increased with loan demand firming and terms and   standards beginning to open up a bit. Residential real estate financing improved   with secondary market appetite for jumbo and ARM mortgages beginning to return   along with greater availability of private mortgage insurance. Bank lending   remained more limited for commercial estate. However, private equity appetite   for multifamily properties continued to be strong, and a contact noted that real   estate investment by European and Asian investors was also on the rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures were limited in April   and May. Cost pressures from earlier increases in steel and energy prices were   reported by several contacts, although the prices of both have decreased   recently. Contacts noted that pressures from rising commodity prices were just   starting to be noticeable and that the volatility of commodity prices was a   greater concern. Wage pressures increased only modestly from the previous   reporting period. Pass-through of cost pressures to downstream prices remained   minimal, with pricing power in most industries continuing to be weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions in the District were slightly   better than normal for this time of year. Planting progress far exceeded that of   a year ago with the exception of the southern portion of Iowa where heavy   precipitation slowed field work. The emergence of corn plants was far ahead of   average across most of the District, while soybean plant emergence was about   typical. Rains were timely for the most part, but a period of cooler weather   slowed crop development until hot and sunny weather gave a needed burst of   energy to young plants in May. Corn and soybean prices remained in the same   range as the prior reporting period, while wheat prices rose. Cattle and hog   prices continued to rebound from last year's lows, as animal numbers were   constrained. Milk prices stabilized after declines, remaining below break-even   levels.
