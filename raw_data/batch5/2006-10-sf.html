      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded at a moderate pace on net 
  during the month of September. Falling energy prices reduced upward pressures 
  on the final prices of some goods and services, while the pace of wage increases 
  generally remained contained but exerted upward price pressure in some industries. 
  Reports on retail sales suggested modest growth on net, while demand for most 
  services remained strong. Orders and output grew further for manufacturers and 
  agricultural producers. Residential real estate markets continued to cool, while 
  activity in commercial real estate markets generally expanded further but moderated 
  in some areas. District banks reported solid loan demand and good credit quality 
  but further declines in demand for residential mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District reports indicated that overall price inflation remained modest. Energy 
  prices fell noticeably in most areas, reducing the retail price of gasoline 
  and relieving upward price pressures for assorted energy-intensive products. 
  Contacts also noted a decline in the prices of selected building materials used 
  primarily for residential construction, although the prices of some other building 
  materials rose. More generally, respondents noted limited price pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall wage growth remained moderate, in the range of 2-4 percent on an annual 
  basis. Wage growth was more rapid for selected groups of workers in short supply, 
  notably in the health-care, finance, and construction sectors, and in fast-growth 
  areas with very tight overall labor markets, such as Idaho and Utah; however, 
  a few respondents in those areas indicated reduced wage pressures of late. Rising 
  labor costs were offset by enhanced production efficiency in most cases, but 
  a few reports indicated significant pass-through to final prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales grew modestly from the previous survey period. Sales rose 
  somewhat for small retail items such as apparel, but they fell for items used 
  for home improvement. Auto demand changed little from the previous survey period; 
  sales of fuel-efficient import vehicles continued to rise at a solid clip, while 
  sales fell further for large, fuel-inefficient domestic models.
     </p>
     <p>
      Service providers generally reported strong demand. Activity continued to 
  expand at a robust pace for providers of health services, and sales grew further 
  for providers of media and high-tech services. Tourist activity remained at 
  high levels in most major markets, but some moderation was noted. In Hawaii, 
  tourist visits and spending were down compared with a year earlier. In parts 
  of California, hotel occupancy rates reportedly have stabilized following a 
  prolonged climb, but room rates continued to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for District manufactured products grew further during the September 
  survey period. Sales of semiconductors expanded at a solid pace that was in 
  line with industry forecasts, although inventories reportedly rose slightly; 
  capacity utilization generally remained in the range of 90 percent. Rapid production 
  activity continued for producers of commercial aircraft and for their parts 
  suppliers, while makers of machine tools reported substantial growth in new 
  orders of late. Food processors reported further sales gains, and demand for 
  apparel was "steady." By contrast, demand for selected building materials used 
  primarily for residential construction fell further. Except for tight supplies 
  of skilled workers in some areas, manufacturing contacts generally reported 
  little or no constraints on their ability to expand output further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of agricultural and resource-related products grew further and production 
  conditions were stable in general. Sales were strong for livestock and most 
  crops, and weather conditions generally were favorable, keeping production on 
  track. However, some spinach producers have put planting on hold due to the 
  recent bacterial outbreak associated with that crop. Respondents noted further 
  easing of labor shortages in the agricultural sector and a reduction in upward 
  price pressures due to falling fuel prices. Extraction of oil and natural gas 
  continued at a rapid pace, with very high capacity utilization noted. However, 
  inventories of natural gas were reported at near-record levels, maintaining 
  downward pressure on the price of this commodity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for residential real estate fell further in most areas, while activity 
  in commercial real estate markets continued to expand but at a slower pace than 
  previously in some areas. The pace of home sales, construction, and price appreciation 
  slowed further in most parts of the District, and contacts in some areas noted 
  that developers have been offering price concessions and other incentives to 
  entice buyers. Demand for commercial and industrial space rose further in most 
  areas, reducing vacancy rates and leading to further increases in rental rates; 
  however, contacts in a few areas reported a recent reduction in the pace of 
  demand growth. In areas where home demand has been resilient or commercial and 
  public projects have grown rapidly, builders continued to face project backlogs 
  and high costs. In other areas, however, overall building activity has fallen, 
  and contacts noted that reduced home demand has led to layoffs for mortgage 
  brokers and real estate agents.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported solid loan demand and good credit quality. 
  Overall loan demand was reported to be "healthy," as further growth in commercial 
  and industrial loans generally offset declines in demand for home loans. However, 
  a few contacts noted slight weakening in overall loan demand relative to the 
  previous survey period. Credit quality was high in general; for example, loan 
  delinquencies were reported to be "practically nonexistent" in Utah and Idaho.
