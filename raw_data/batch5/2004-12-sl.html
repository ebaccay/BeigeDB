      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
      <p>
       Business activity in the Eighth District expanded modestly since our previous 

  survey. In manufacturing, a majority of contacts reported plans to open plants 

  and hire additional workers. Most contacts in the services sector continued 

  to report improved economic activity. Retail and auto sales declined in September 

  and October with respect to year-earlier levels. Residential real estate markets 

  continued to do well, while commercial real estate markets remained soft. Overall 

  lending conditions at a sample of District banks were mostly unchanged in the 

  three months ending in October.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported that retail sales in September and October were down, on average, 

  over year-earlier levels. While 26 percent of the retailers surveyed noted that 

  sales levels met their expectations, 70 percent reported that sales were below 

  what they had anticipated and 4 percent reported sales above expectations. Women's 

  fashion accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, shoes, athletic apparel, and computers 

  were all strong sellers, while furniture, big appliances, luxury and specialty 

  items, and toys were moving more slowly. Nearly 80 percent of contacts noted 

  that inventories were at desired levels. Retailers appear generally optimistic 

  about sales during the upcoming holiday season, and more than 80 percent of 

  contacts expect that sales will increase over 2003 levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in 

  September and October were slightly down, on average. About 64 percent of the 

  car dealers surveyed reported decreases in sales, while another 24 percent reported 

  increases. About one third of the car dealers noted that used car sales had 

  increased relative to new car sales, and about 32 percent reported an increase 

  in low-end vehicle sales relative to high-end vehicle sales. About 38 percent 

  of the contacts surveyed reported increased use of rebates, while 43 percent 

  reported no change. Nearly all of the respondents reported no change in the 

  acceptance rates of finance applications. About 60 percent of the car dealers 

  surveyed reported that their inventories were at desired levels, while 32 percent 

  reported that their inventories were too high, with a few contacts reporting 

  excess of sport utility vehicles. A slight majority of the car dealers surveyed 

  expect increased sales over 2003 for the remainder of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing has shown modest improvement since our previous report, with a 

  majority of firms reporting plans to open plants and expand operations and fewer 

  firms reporting plans to close plants and lay off workers. Several firms in 

  the aerospace, food manufacturing, auto parts, electrical equipment, manufactured 

  home, and fabricated metal product industries announced plans to open new plants, 

  which will likely result in more than 750 new jobs by 2006. A firm in the paper 

  manufacturing industry reported plans to relocate its headquarters to the District 

  and add several hundred new jobs. Firms in the household appliance, auto parts, 

  and fabricated metal products industries reported plans to expand existing plants 

  and hire as many as 640 workers. In contrast, firms in the plumbing fixture, 

  nonmetallic mineral, and furniture industries reported plans to close plants, 

  displacing as many as 500 workers. Other firms in the auto parts and household 

  appliance industries reported plans to lay off approximately 310 workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most contacts in the services sector continued to report improved economic 

  activity. Firms in the freight transportation, recreation, financial and insurance 

  services, traveler accommodation, and health services industries reported openings, 

  expansions, and increases in hiring, likely resulting in more than 1,020 new 

  jobs. A firm in the freight transportation industry plans to hire as many as 

  425 temporary workers to meet increased holiday demand. In contrast, firms in 

  the food services and air transportation industries reported facility closures 

  and workforce reductions. A firm in the utility industry plans to reduce its 

  workforce with a voluntary termination package offered to as many as 950 workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential markets continued to do well in most of the Eighth District in September. 

  In the greater Louisville area, September year-to-date sales increased by 2.1 

  percent compared with the same period in 2003. The increase in year-to-date 

  sales was 4.7 percent for the greater St. Louis area and 15.8 percent for Memphis. 

  Sales were still strong in Little Rock and the Tupelo region. Year-to-date single-family 

  housing permits increased in most of the District's metropolitan areas compared 

  with the same period last year. September year-to-date permits in St. Louis 

  City and County grew by 19.6 percent compared with the same period in 2003. 

  Residential construction has been flat in Jackson, Tennessee but remained steady 

  in southern Indiana and northeast Arkansas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets continued to lag behind residential markets 

  in most of the District. The third-quarter industrial vacancy rate in the greater 

  Louisville area remained virtually unchanged at 18.2 percent compared with the 

  previous quarter. The overall office vacancy rate in Louisville's central business 

  district rose to 21 percent in the third quarter from 20.4 percent in the previous 

  quarter. Contacts reported that office leasing was very slow in downtown Little 

  Rock. There was some improvement in commercial construction in most of the District. 

  Construction activity has been picking up in Little Rock, and it has remained 

  steady in southern Indiana.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A survey of senior loan officers at a sample of District banks indicated little 

  change in overall lending activity in the three months ending in October. During 

  this period, credit standards and demand for commercial and industrial loans 

  remained unchanged for both large and small firms. Similarly, credit standards 

  for commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and consumer loans remained 

  basically unchanged. The demand for commercial real estate loans showed some 

  indication of being moderately stronger. During the same period, the demand 

  for residential mortgage loans varied from moderately weaker to moderately stronger 

  and the demand for consumer loans was basically unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Recent rains in the District have improved pasture conditions and soil moisture 

  levels. The corn harvest is now virtually complete in all District states. The 

  soybean harvest is mostly complete in Illinois, Indiana, and Mississippi, but 

  it is behind its average pace in the remaining District states. The cotton harvest 

  is running behind its average pace because of wet conditions, and the rice harvest 

  is complete. November yield and total production estimates for corn, soybeans, 

  rice, and cotton surpass those of last year. With the exception of Illinois 

  and Indiana, winter wheat planting in the District states is far behind because 

  of delays caused by wet weather conditions.
