      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales and revenue results at First  District retailers and manufacturers continue to be mixed, but contacts  indicate that business activity is generally softening.  Respondents cite ongoing cost pressures; many  manufacturers say they have raised or plan to raise prices.  Revenue growth rates have slowed for software  and information technology services firms in the region, and most staffing  firms report little growth.  Contacts in  residential real estate cite some positive signs, but ongoing declines in home  sales and prices.  According to most  respondents, the outlook remains uncertain.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail  contacts in the First District report mixed sales results for the months of  April and May. Retailers say they see clear evidence that consumers are scaling  back their spending, and the majority of respondents complain that the media's  "doom and gloom" portrayal of the economy contributes to such cutbacks.  One retailer is concerned about the squeeze that  credit market turmoil is putting on customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventory  levels and employment are generally stable, with several respondents  scrutinizing the need for future hiring. Capital spending is largely on plan. A  majority of contacted First District retailers mention cost pressures, mostly  related to oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall,  First District retailers are cautious in their outlook and expect the next few  months to be a continued challenge.   However, most are confident they will pull through this period of economic  uncertainty; they expect conditions to improve by early to mid-2009.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing and Related Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Many  manufacturers and related services providers headquartered in the First  District see signs that business trends are deteriorating in the current  quarter.  Contacts say that demand has  started to weaken for nonresidential building equipment and for non-automotive  transportation equipment and services.   Two manufacturers of health-related equipment indicate that orders have  slowed, and a machinery maker reports that business "has fallen off a cliff" in  the second quarter.  In contrast to the  general picture, demand for energy-related equipment and scientific and  analytical instruments continues to grow in line with recent trends.  Contacts from various industries report that overseas  markets remain relatively strong, although some say their Western European  sales have been sluggish in recent months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many  manufacturers continue to voice concerns about sharply rising materials costs,  especially metals, plastics and other petroleum derivatives, and chemicals.  They also mention that energy and transport  costs have increased substantially. Most of the affected respondents have  raised prices or expect to do so shortly.   However, some firms are experiencing margin pressures because of  competition in specific product markets or deteriorating finances on the part  of their business customers.
       </p>
       <p>
        A  majority of manufacturing respondents have implemented restructuring programs  to reduce their U.S.  headcounts.  The remaining firms are  mostly holding domestic employment steady.   Average pay increases are in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent.  Contacts generally describe their 2008 U.S.  capital spending plans as normal and say their domestic investments focus on  reducing operating costs or developing new products.  Roughly one-half of the sample point to  lingering problems in capital markets; they mention high costs or stringent  conditions, or they worry that funding may not be available for large, lumpy  projects such as acquisitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost all firms express concerns about the U.S.  economy, especially consumer spending, housing markets, and energy costs.  Many expect that the impact on their business  will be most notable between now and the end of the summer.  A few mention likely or potential  vulnerabilities in 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Software and Information Technology Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        First  District software and IT services contacts report mixed results for the first  quarter of 2008, with a couple showing negative revenue growth from a year ago,  but the majority experiencing gains. A few firms cite delays in signing  contracts, which they take as a sign that their clients are uncertain about the  economy.  Two software companies note  that domestic licensing revenue has been harder to come by in recent months.  One-half of respondents are adding technology  workers and sales staff, although at a much slower pace than during the  previous quarter; among the other half, one firm has increased employment  significantly, while the remaining firms are holding headcount stable.  Respondents report that the labor market for technical talent remains tight.  All contacted firms have raised pay, generally around 4 percent.  The majority of New England software and information technology respondents are  projecting revenues to continue growing at current rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Staffing Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        New  England staffing firms experienced a wide range of business conditions this  quarter, with one contact reporting that business is "the worst I have ever  seen," while another posted a revenue increase of nearly 20 percent compared to  a year earlier.  For the majority of  respondents, however, business activity is either flat or changing only  slightly.  Contacts indicate high labor  demand from the pharmaceutical, engineering, semiconductor, and aerospace  industries, as well as specific needs for web developers, CAD programmers, and  project managers.  Reports on labor  supply conditions vary across firms, with one contact seeing as many as ten new  applicants per day, while another reports a dearth of applicants, partly  resulting from caution about giving up existing jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several  staffing executives report a change in hiring procedures among client  companies.  One contact says, "Clients  are holding out for the A candidate, when in the past, they took the A and B  candidate."  Another complains about  "intense scrutiny on resumes," which is putting applicants for temporary  positions through a rigorous process akin to that used for permanent hires.  One contact believes recent economic  uncertainty has augmented business, with client companies increasingly turning  to temporary staffing to avoid long-term obligations.  On the other hand, some clients are hesitant  to undertake new projects, thus lowering their need for job applicants.  Despite their concern over economic  instability, respondents in the staffing industry voice optimism regarding the  second half of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Commercial Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Commercial  real estate contacts report that the Boston office building market, which was  largely dormant in the first quarter, has seen a number of properties come up  for sale in recent weeks; however, one contact notes that the number of closed  transactions has not yet edged up significantly.  Respondents indicate that commercial mortgage  originations are still being made only by traditional portfolio lenders--life  insurance companies and commercial banks--and not by Wall Street investment  banks, and lending standards remain relatively stringent.  A small mutual bank in Boston  continues to enjoy increased demand for its loans, but expects competition from  Wall Street dealers to return by year's end.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contacts  indicate that commercial leasing activity has slowed further in recent weeks,  but not dramatically so.  Many say that  maintenance and construction costs are up sharply, putting pressure on net  operating incomes.  In greater Boston,  contracted rents for prime office space are falling short of original asking  rents.  Existing tenants are cutting back  on space.  Absorption is negative and  vacancies continue to edge up.  Downtown  buildings appear to be doing fine, with about 10 percent vacancy, but activity  is slower in the suburbs, where vacancy is estimated at 14 percent or higher.  Leasing activity has been slow throughout  other parts of New England but, as in Boston,  office vacancy rates are still low or average by historical standards.  Retail leasing activity has been strong among  tourist-oriented shops in Maine,  but slower in strip-mall developments across the region, where vacancy appears  to be up slightly.  A Providence  contact reports that commercial real estate in Rhode    Island is currently "in a recession."
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite  the downbeat reports, commercial real estate contacts throughout the District  indicate that layoffs have been minimal so far.   Expectations are that market conditions will get slightly worse before  getting better, with the turnaround expected by the fourth quarter of 2008 or  the first quarter of 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Residential Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Residential  real estate markets in New England again saw declines in  home sales and prices compared to year-earlier periods.  Massachusetts  home sales decreased 16 percent year-over-year in April--somewhat less than in  previous months--while condo sales decreased 27 percent.  Connecticut  and New Hampshire experienced  year-to-date home sales declines of 28 percent and 24 percent, respectively, compared to 2007.  Rhode    Island home sales decreased 18 percent year-over-year  in March, and Maine home sales  decreased 23 percent year-over-year in April.   Meanwhile, median home prices are down 8 percent to 11 percent from a  year earlier across the states.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contacts  in Massachusetts continue to  report increased activity at open houses, and April's pending home sales  numbers in the Boston area are said  to look promising.  However, one contact  notes that financing issues could still prevent increased activity from  translating into increased sales.
