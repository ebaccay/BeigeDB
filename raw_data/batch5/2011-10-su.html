      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based   on information collected on or before October 7, 2011. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that overall   economic activity continued to expand in September, although many Districts   described the pace of growth as "modest" or "slight" and contacts generally   noted weaker or less certain outlooks for business conditions. The reports   suggest that consumer spending was up slightly in most Districts, with auto   sales and tourism leading the way in several of them. Business spending   increased somewhat, particularly for construction and mining equipment and auto   dealer inventories, but many Districts noted restraint in hiring and capital   spending plans. By sector, manufacturing and transportation activity was   reported to have increased on balance. A few Districts also reported slight   improvements in construction and real estate activity; nonetheless, overall   conditions for both residential and commercial real estate remained weak.   Districts reporting on nonfinancial services cited mixed results with activity   varying widely by industry. Loan demand by and large moved lower, with the   exception of an increase in mortgage refinancing in many Districts. Crop   conditions at harvest were generally less favorable than a year ago. In   contrast, energy and mining activity continued to strengthen in several   Districts, with the exception of some storm-related slowdowns in the Gulf of   Mexico. Cost pressures eased in the majority of Districts, though there was some   further pass-through of earlier increases to downstream prices. Wage pressures   remained subdued outside of a few exceptions in which firms noted having   difficulty finding appropriately skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was up   slightly in September. The majority of Districts reported increases in auto   sales, with the largest improvements in San Francisco and New York. Several   Districts noted a greater availability of new vehicles as the supply disruptions   that had plagued auto dealerships in the aftermath of the Japanese disaster   subsided. Contacts in the Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and Dallas   Districts indicated that demand for used cars remained high and that some models   were still scarce. A large number of Districts reported that non-auto retail   sales were flat to down in September; but a few, such as Philadelphia, Richmond,   and Dallas noted an increase in customer traffic late in the month and into   early October. Back-to-school sales were described as being fairly strong in New   York and satisfactory in Richmond. In addition, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City,   and Dallas cited some strength in the sales of big-ticket or luxury items, while   Minneapolis and Chicago noted that more consumers were trading down to value   products at grocery stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism was generally higher in those Districts reporting on the sector.   Contacts in New York noted that, despite the negative impact of Hurricane Irene,   Broadway and hotel revenues continued to rise. Richmond reported substantial   damage from Hurricane Irene to some tourist destinations that were subsequently   forced to close for repairs, but tourism remained vibrant in other areas.   Boston, Atlanta, and Minneapolis also cited increases in tourism, with   hospitality contacts in Atlanta expecting a robust holiday season. Tourism   results were mixed across various destinations in the San Francisco   district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending increased somewhat   from the previous report. However, contacts in a number of Districts reported   that a weaker and more uncertain economic outlook had increased caution and was   weighing on future spending plans. Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago indicated   that many retailers were reluctant to build inventories ahead of the holiday   season, pointing to recent declines in consumer confidence. Auto dealers were an   exception, as they continued to replenish inventories that ran low in the   aftermath of the production disruptions caused by the Japanese disaster. Capital   spending continued as planned in most Districts. Respondents in Cleveland,   Atlanta, and Chicago noted increased purchases of equipment in the   manufacturing, mining, and transportation industries. Boston and Minneapolis   indicated that some manufacturers planned to expand capacity either through   mergers and acquisitions or the building of additional facilities. Atlanta cited   a pick-up in corporate expansion and relocation interest, and Chicago noted an   increase in mergers and acquisitions activity among middle-market firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports regarding nonfinancial   services were mixed in September. Richmond noted slower overall activity, and   St. Louis cited reduced demand for telecommunications, media, and education   services. Demand for accounting and legal services was reported to have been   unchanged in both Dallas and San Francisco. On the positive side, contacts in   St. Louis reported that demand for business support services increased, and   Boston reported strong business conditions for economic consulting firms   involved with litigation work and advertising firms helping to market financial   services. In addition, San Francisco noted continued growth in demand for   technology services, Minneapolis noted an increase in activity in software and   engineering, and Philadelphia cited some growth in logistics. Staffing at   nonfinancial service-sector firms was reported to have been up slightly in   Richmond, but growth slowed in Chicago and Philadelphia reported flat activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts indicated that   manufacturing and transportation activity increased since the last report in   most Districts. A large number of Districts reported higher production of autos   and other transportation-related equipment. Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago   noted increases in auto production, and Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and St. Louis   all cited robust activity for auto suppliers. Dallas reported healthy demand for   nondefense transportation goods. Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and San   Francisco indicated continued growth in commercial aviation and aerospace   manufacturing. Steel production rose in Cleveland and Chicago, and in a number   of Districts metal manufacturers' new orders also rose. Other areas of   manufacturing were more mixed. The Dallas report noted a decline in refining   activity. However, both Dallas and Atlanta continued to note robust oil and gas   drilling activity, and this activity was said to be propelling demand for   related equipment from suppliers in Chicago. Manufacturing of construction   materials or equipment was reported to have increased some in Philadelphia,   Chicago, and Dallas but remained weak in most other Districts. Growth in   high-tech manufacturing continued to be robust in Boston, but moderated in   Dallas and San Francisco. Respondents reported that food production was up in   Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, steady in Dallas, and lower in Boston.   Manufacturers of consumer products reported a softening in orders in Richmond,   Chicago, and Dallas, while new orders for apparel increased in San Francisco.   Freight traffic increased in Cleveland and Atlanta, driven in large part by   shipments of commodities, and Richmond also noted that port activity for   commodities continued to be robust. However, Richmond also indicated that   imports and exports, in particular of consumer goods, were both somewhat soft   during what is typically the peak season for trade.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      All twelve Districts   reported that real estate and construction activity was little changed on   balance from the prior report. Residential construction remained at low levels,   particularly for single-family homes. That said, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and   Minneapolis noted small increases in single-family construction, and   construction of multifamily dwellings continued to increase at a moderate pace   in Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. Home   sales remained weak overall, and home prices were reported to be either flat or   declining across all of the Districts. In contrast, rental demand continued to   rise in a number of Districts. Commercial real estate conditions remained weak   overall, although commercial construction increased at a slow pace in most   Districts. Boston, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Cleveland cited some gains in   demand for construction of education, healthcare, and institutional-related   buildings, and New York reported an increase in hotel development. Furthermore,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago noted an increase in demand for   manufacturing and distribution facilities. Vacancy rates remained elevated, but   Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis and Dallas reported an increase in leasing   activity and Philadelphia and San Francisco indicated rising investor interest   in well-leased office space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial activity was reported to   have weakened some since the last report. Dallas noted that the improvement in   financial conditions had stalled, and Chicago indicated a further tightening of   credit conditions, particularly for financial firms. In addition, New York   reported noticeably weaker activity in the securities industry. Loan volumes   were either flat or down slightly in most Districts. Consumer loan demand moved   lower according to respondents in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, and it   held steady in New York and San Francisco. However, New York, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted an increase in mortgage   refinancing activity given lower mortgage rates and Cleveland also noted   continued strength in auto lending and increased demand for business loans.   Meanwhile, business loan demand was described as down somewhat in Philadelphia,   Chicago, St. Louis, and Kansas City and was little changed in most other   Districts. Loan standards were described as still tight for many classes of   borrowers. That said, several Districts indicated that strong competition among   banks for high quality borrowers was leading to lower rates and fees for these   customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts generally   reported that crop conditions at harvest were less favorable than a year ago,   although results varied by and within Districts. Lower yields than a year ago   were reported for major crops in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts   and in most of the Kansas City District. Even so, yields were large enough to   alleviate worries about shortages. Corn, soybean, and wheat prices moved down,   while some contacts noted higher prices for cotton. Drought conditions persisted   in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts, and pastures were in worse   shape than a year ago in many areas. Although there were declines in feed costs,   poultry and livestock producers remained pressured by drought and the cost   increases of the past year. Hog, poultry, and dairy prices decreased, while   cattle prices increased. Still, agricultural prices tended to be higher than a   year ago, boosting farm incomes outside of drought-stricken areas. Chicago and   Kansas City reported higher agricultural land values.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in energy-producing sectors strengthened in the Cleveland,   Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta reported   a decrease in off-shore operations in the Gulf of Mexico due to Tropical Storm   Lee. Cleveland and Atlanta also anticipated increased capital investments in oil   and gas production, since new technology has lowered costs and boosted output.   Contacts in Minneapolis reported plans for expanded wind generation of   electricity. Mining activity in the Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco   Districts was strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Respondents indicated that   labor market conditions were little changed, on balance, in September. Several   Districts cited only limited and selective demand for new hires. Cleveland,   Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City all noted that firms in some sectors   that were hiring more broadly (such as manufacturing, transportation, and   energy) were also experiencing difficulties in finding appropriately skilled or   qualified labor. Respondents in the Boston, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago   Districts indicated that hiring was being restrained by elevated uncertainty or   lower expectations for their future growth. New York reported that deteriorating   business conditions in the finance industry had led to a pull back in hiring   with some layoffs anticipated in the months ahead. Richmond and Chicago reported   reduced seasonal hiring in retail trade given apprehension about the strength of   holiday sales, while New York indicated that seasonal hiring was likely to   increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported that wage pressures remained subdued. Exceptions were   generally for workers with specialized skills or in areas where firms were   having difficulty finding workers. For instance, Atlanta and San Francisco cited   wage gains for workers with specialized skills, such as in information   technology, Minneapolis reported wage increases in the energy industry, and   Cleveland noted higher wages for truck drivers. In addition, contacts in   Minneapolis and Cleveland noted increases in non-wage costs such as healthcare.   Most other cost pressures moderated in September. Although Kansas City and San   Francisco reported increases in raw material costs, most Districts reported a   general decline in commodity prices, including prices of oil and industrial   metals. Many Districts indicated that there continued to be some further   pass-through of past increases to wholesale prices. Though retail contacts noted   a hesitation to increase prices with demand still weak, many Districts reported   increased pass-through of costs in the retail sector, particularly for food and   cotton-based goods.
