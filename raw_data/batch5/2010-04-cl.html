      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District showed further signs of strengthening   since our last report. Manufacturers told us that the rise in production which   began late last year continued, although orders remain below pre-recession   levels. Contacts in non-residential construction noted some signs of renewed   growth, but they are concerned about its sustainability. Financing remains a   major issue for residential and commercial contractors. Sales figures from   District retailers and auto dealers showed a moderate improvement. Energy   production was mixed and reports indicate a continuing upturn in freight   transport volume. Demand by businesses and consumers for new loans remains weak,   although some bankers noted that the lending environment is starting to grow   more competitive.
     </p>
     <p>
      A pickup in employment was notable in the manufacturing sector, where   businesses are recalling some workers and increasing production hours. A   majority of staffing-firm representatives indicated that new job openings   increased, primarily in healthcare. Wage pressures continue to be contained.   Apart from rising prices for steel and petroleum-based products, raw materials   and product pricing was generally stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District factories showed that   production was largely stable or rose slightly during the past six weeks, with a   few of our contacts citing an increase in their backlogs. Most manufacturers   told us that production levels have increased on a year-over-year basis, though   by varying amounts. In general, our respondents are cautiously optimistic and   expect their sales to increase at a modest rate going into summer, but they are   not expecting a return to pre-recession levels through the end of the year.   Steel shipments were better than anticipated, with rising volume being driven   primarily by autos, energy, and heavy equipment. Looking forward, many of our   steel contacts said that they are uncertain if the rise in volume is sustainable   in the long-term. Nonetheless, they expect shipping volume during the next few   months to at least approach levels seen in the first quarter. District auto   production was stable in February on a month-over-month basis, and showed a   substantial rise when comparing year-over-year data for both domestic and   foreign nameplates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on inventories were mixed. Half of our contacts said that product   supplies are low relative to demand, while others reported that their   inventories remain well balanced. Capacity utilization continued a slow upward   trend. Capital outlays are on target, with monies being allocated primarily for   maintenance projects, new equipment, or IT upgrades. Manufacturers said that   outlays will remain below pre-recession levels until a robust recovery is   underway. We heard many reports of increasing steel prices, which were   attributed primarily to rising raw materials (iron ore, scrap, and alloys)   costs. There was little response on the part of manufacturers to raise their own   prices because of relatively weak market conditions. However, some of our   respondents are beginning to initiate materials surcharges. We heard numerous   reports of recalling laid-off workers and increased work hours, while new hiring   was limited to temporaries. Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, new home sales improved slightly   during the past six weeks and on a year-over-year basis. Nonetheless, some   builders are struggling to close sales. Purchases of entry-level homes continue   to do well, and several contacts told us that the move-up category is gaining   momentum. Builders expressed concern about the potential effect on home sales   when the first-time home buyers' tax credit expires and the downward pressure on   home prices, which they attributed to unreliable appraisals. They also reported   that banks remain unwilling to lend money for constructing spec houses or buying   land. Homebuilders are not anticipating a big turnaround in the housing market,   and they expect total sales volume in 2010 will equal or be slightly greater   than last year's volume. Little change was noted in the list prices of new   homes, construction material costs, and subcontractor pricing. General   contractors and subcontractors continue to operate with skeleton crews.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in non-residential construction showed early signs of a pickup.   Inquiries have improved, and many contractors said that they are beginning to   rebuild their backlogs. Most projects currently under-way fall within the   industrial and energy categories. Half of our contacts are uncertain about the   level of construction activity for the remainder of 2010, while others see a   small improvement when compared to 2009. We continue to hear accounts of   difficulties in obtaining project financing, even for credit-worthy borrowers.   Increased costs for construction materials were limited to steel and   petroleum-based products. General contractors reported that other than seasonal   hiring, their employment levels have been flat. Subcontractors are still   struggling, with many of them taking on projects at cost.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      For the period from mid-February   through mid-March, retail sales were generally stronger when compared to the   previous 30-day period and were up on a year-over-year basis. Although consumers   continue to focus on buying necessities over discretionary items, retailers   noted that they see a pickup in the sales of home furnishings. Looking forward,   retailers are cautiously optimistic, and most expect sales to improve somewhat   during the second quarter. Vendor and store pricing has been relatively stable.   Retailers commented that they are placing less emphasis on promotions and   markdowns, and store inventories continued on the lean side. Auto dealers   characterized new vehicle sales from mid-February through mid-March as decent,   with little change when compared to year-ago sales. Used-vehicle purchases are   holding steady. Overall, sales are expected to show a modest improvement at best   during the second quarter. Dealer inventory positions have improved since our   last report, though a few dealers still characterize it as light. Several   contacts told us that buyer credit is beginning to loosen, as community banks   and credit unions are becoming more aggressive. Reports show little change in   staffing levels at retailers or auto dealers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for new business loans remains weak,   although a few bankers noted that they are beginning to see their pipelines   become more active. Interest rates were steady. Some of our respondents also   commented that the lending environment is growing more competitive. On the   consumer side, loan demand was mixed. While several bankers said that demand was   very weak, others are seeing a slight increase, which they attributed to   seasonal factors and draw-downs on HELOCs. The residential mortgage market is   stable, with most activity dominated by refinancings. Core deposits continued to   show strong growth at most banks. Interest spreads are widening due primarily to   term deposit repricing. Credit standards have not changed appreciably in the   past six weeks, though commercial real estate lending is receiving closer   scrutiny. Reports on the credit quality of loan applicants were mixed. Almost   all of our respondents told us that delinquencies have stabilized or declined.   Employment growth at banks was limited to some strategic hires.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little change in oil and natural gas output was   reported during the past six weeks, with only a slight increase expected during   the second quarter. Spot prices for natural gas are on the decline, while oil   prices are fluctuating within a narrow range. We heard mixed reports on coal   production. One producer noted that demand from off-shore customers for   metallurgical coal has increased significantly and that his company is reopening   one of its idled mines. Prices for coal were mixed but tended to the upside. In   general, capital expenditures showed a modest improvement. Production equipment   and materials costs were flat, although we heard some reports that the rise in   steel prices is making its way down the supply chain. Employment was steady, and   little hiring is expected in the near future. Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport executives reported that   shipping volume continues to show a gradual improvement, and they expect this   trend to persist for the remainder of the year. However, profit margins remain   constrained due primarily to overcapacity and rising fuel costs, which have to   be absorbed into the current rate structure. Apart from fuel prices, operating   costs have been relatively stable, although there is some concern about rising   costs associated with regulatory compliance. Equipment purchases remain at low   levels, with little change expected until there is a substantial pickup in   shipping volume. Hiring was limited to replacement only.
