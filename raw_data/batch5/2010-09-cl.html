      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District showed a slight   improvement during the past six weeks. Manufacturers reported that new orders   and production levels were stable or marginally lower. An uptick was seen in   residential and nonresidential construction, while retailers and auto dealers   experienced a small rise in sales. Reports from energy producers and freight   haulers were generally favorable. Demand by businesses and consumers for new   loans remained weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pace of new hiring has diminished, with only scattered reports of   increased payrolls from manufacturers, nonresidential builders, and auto   dealers. Overall, staffing-firm representatives noted little change in the   number of new job openings, with available openings concentrated in healthcare   and the skilled trades. Wage pressures continue to be contained. Apart from a   rise in steel and agricultural commodity prices, raw materials and product   pricing were generally stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from District factories show that   production levels were mainly steady or down slightly during the past six weeks.   Changes in new orders mirrored those in output. Production was higher on a   year-over-year basis, with several contacts citing double-digit increases. A   large majority of respondents expect output will stay at current levels for the   near term. Those anticipating a drop in production attributed it primarily to   seasonal factors or the continuing slump in residential construction. Most steel   producers and service centers reported that volume was stable or increasing.   Shipments are being driven by energy-related, auto, and heavy equipment   industries. Construction volume remains weak. Although underlying uncertainty   exists, more than half of our steel contacts expect that the current level of   business activity is sustainable in the near term. District auto production   showed a large drop in July on a month-over-month basis, due to retooling for   model changeovers. In terms of year-over-year comparisons, production rose   substantially for both domestic and foreign nameplates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only minor shifts in inventories were noted, mostly on the up side. A   majority of our contacts stated that utilization rates remain below   pre-recession levels, with little change during the past few weeks. Capital   outlays continue at relatively low levels, with any significant increases due to   investment projects that had been previously delayed. Steel producers and   service center representatives reported that raw material prices are rising,   although most indicated that their product pricing remains reasonably stable. A   few have announced price increases that will go into effect as early as   September. Other than a sharp rise in agricultural commodity prices, raw   material costs have been fairly steady. We heard only scattered reports of   companies hiring new workers, although several firms have extended work hours.   Wage pressures are contained.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       An uptick was seen in new home construction   during the past six weeks and it is on par with year-ago levels. Homebuilders   expect construction to remain sluggish going into 2011. Tight credit markets   continue to hamper contractors from purchasing land or constructing spec houses.   Our contacts tell us that the move-up price-point category is outperforming the   entry-level and third-time home-buyer categories. New home prices have shown   little movement since our last report and on a year-over-year basis. Other than   reductions in lumber prices, construction material costs held steady. General   contractors and subcontractors continue to work with very lean crews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports by nonresidential builders indicate some improvement in construction   activity since our last report. When comparing to year-ago levels, activity is   as good or better according to almost all of our contacts. Backlogs are   reasonably healthy, though two builders noted that their backlogs are being   depleted at a rapid pace. Inquiries and new projects generally fall within the   industrial and education categories. Most of our contacts expect little change   in business conditions during the next 6 to 12 months, citing some weakness in   inquiries and uncertainty about economic growth. Reports of a small increase in   construction material costs, especially for steel, were widespread, and the   availability of project financing has improved slightly. General contractors   cited an uptick in payrolls. Subcontractors remain underutilized and are taking   on projects at cost.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       For the period from mid-July through   mid-August, retail sales generally showed some improvement when compared to the   previous 30-day period. Purchases rose slightly on a year-over-year basis.   Still, consumers remain cautious in their purchases and are focusing on   value-priced seasonal items. Going into the fourth quarter, retailers expect   conservative sales growth. Two of our contacts noted modest price increases by   their suppliers, which they have passed through to consumers. Margins are up   slightly for most of our contacts. Other than replacement workers, retailers   plan no additional hiring until the holiday season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto dealers saw new vehicle sales strengthen from mid-July through   mid-August, when compared with the previous 30 days. Reports also showed   improving sales on a year-over-year basis. Expectations call for vehicle   purchases to stabilize at current levels in the upcoming months. Many dealers   continue to say that their inventories are at low levels. Used vehicle purchases   are beginning to soften. Interest rates for auto loans are competitive, although   arranging financing for customers with less than high credit ratings remains a   challenge. Several auto dealers noted that they are undertaking facility   upgrades to comply with OEM demands, and they are doing incremental hiring to   meet customer demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The market for business lending remains soft,   with bankers generally characterizing the demand for new commercial and   industrial loans as steady or slowly improving. Commercial real estate lending   is particularly weak. Interest rates moved by only a few basis points. On the   consumer side, conventional loan demand is weak. Those seeing an uptick   attributed it mainly to consumers looking for home equity loans and competitive   pricing. Most of our contacts said that the demand for residential mortgage   refinancing is very strong, while new-purchase mortgage originations continue at   a slow pace. Core deposits held steady or increased at almost all banks, with   much of the growth occurring in transaction accounts. Reports on credit quality   were mixed, while delinquency rates declined somewhat. Employment rolls and   wages showed little change.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports indicate steady to moderate increases in   oil and natural gas output during the past six weeks, with output expected to   remain at current levels in the near term. A big push is on to lease large   tracts of farmland in eastern Ohio counties for the Marcellus Shale play.   Farmers are being offered well-above average market rates for drilling rights.   Spot prices for oil and natural gas are flat or down slightly. Coal production   has been stable since our last report, with little change expected. Although   summer cooling demand grew significantly from year-ago levels, resulting in   stockpiles being drawn-down to normal levels, utilities have not increased their   coal purchases. Metallurgical coal shipments to Brazil and Asia were   characterized as very strong. Prices for coal were mixed but are tending to the   up side. Credit availability is affecting capital spending: A coal producer   canceled a machinery purchase because he could not obtain financing, while an   energy company is expanding drilling operations due to a successful refinancing.   Staffing levels are steady, and little hiring is expected in the near   future.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Transportation
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Freight transport executives reported   continuing favorable volume trends, though the rate of growth seen in the past   few months is slowing. Expectations call for current volume to be sustained in   the near term. Two executives noted that they have been able to successfully   negotiate rate increases, resulting in some improvement to their bottom lines.   Several of our contacts reported that quoted prices for tractors and trailers   have risen substantially, due mainly to complying with new environmental   standards. However, these price increases may push back time tables for   purchasing replacement equipment until sometime in 2011. Otherwise, only modest   price increases were noted for materials and services used by freight haulers.   Current hiring is for replacement only, not adding capacity.
