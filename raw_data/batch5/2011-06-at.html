      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixth District business contacts reported that economic activity moderated   somewhat in April and May. Retailers experienced a deceleration in sales and   traffic, which they attributed to periods of adverse weather and high gasoline   prices. Tourism-related spending, however, increased across all segments of the   industry. Homebuilders noted continued low levels of sales and construction,   while brokers cited modest improvements in sales and traffic. In spite of   declines in residential inventories, prices also decreased for both new and   existing homes. Commercial contractors reported that new construction activity   remained weak. Overall, the majority of manufacturers continued to report   increases in new orders and production. Auto manufacturers, however, reduced   production because of supply constraints stemming from the Japanese earthquake.   The late April tornadoes in several states and flooding on the lower Mississippi   River had a significant impact on economic activity in the directly affected   areas, but no major damage to the energy or transportation infrastructure was   reported. Bankers reported that loan demand had improved slightly from weak   levels. Labor markets continued to improve gradually across the District. Firms   expressed concern over rising commodity costs as margins remained tight and   productivity gains became more difficult to realize.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District merchants   signaled a deceleration in sales in April and May after moderate increases   earlier in the year. Retailers said that periodic adverse weather conditions and   high gasoline prices combined to dampen sales across the District. Contacts   reported that they continued to manage inventories tightly. The outlook among   District retailers remained optimistic. Auto dealers noted both declining   inventories and firm demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity improved further throughout the District. Occupancy and room   rates were boosted by increases in both business and leisure travel. Convention   and cruise bookings have increased as well. Overall, contacts in the travel   industry remained optimistic. Several restaurant contacts reported that sales   were somewhat softer and that higher food prices had led to tighter margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders   indicated that new home sales and construction remained at very low levels in   April and May. Several Alabama builders reported that in many areas repairs and   rebuilding from the April tornado damage was underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      District residential brokers indicated that existing home sales growth   remained slightly ahead of the year-earlier level, but softened somewhat from   March to April. However, the majority of Florida brokers continued to experience   gains. Florida contacts again noted that distressed sales and cash buyers were   significant drivers of activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both residential builders and brokers indicated that housing inventories   eased on a year-over-year basis. District brokers noted more modest price   declines than earlier this year, while most builders continued to cite downward   pressure on home prices. Brokers reported that buyer traffic improved, while   builders indicated weaker buyer interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity remained at low levels during April and   May. Commercial brokers indicated that most markets continued to stabilize, but   the pace of activity remained slow. Growing demand for apartments spurred an   increase in multifamily development in several parts of the region. Overall,   commercial construction activity is expected to remain at low levels for the   rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers   noted an increase in new orders and production in April and May. The majority of   contacts planned to increase production in the short-term. The exceptions were   auto producers and parts suppliers that experienced input constraints stemming   from the Japanese earthquake. However, these contacts reported that lost   production would be made up later in the year as supply channels returned to   normal. District ports reported increased volumes in cargo and shipments. Air   cargo contacts noted that tonnage was returning to near pre-recession levels.   Railway firms cited strong increases in exports of chemicals, coal, and other   energy-related products to China and India. The flooding of the Mississippi   River is not expected to cause long-term disruptions to maritime traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Businesses outside of the   construction and real estate segments reported a slight improvement in credit   availability. Banking contacts remarked that business loan demand had improved   modestly, but new firms had difficulty qualifying for credit because of their   inability to meet cash flow requirements. Bankers indicated that consumer loan   demand remained flat as consumers continued to pay down equity and consolidate   debt. Credit availability for auto loans continued to improve. Some firms   continued to rely on cash reserves for capital expenditures and expansions.   District banks also noted an increase in credit requests from agriculture   customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to improve   gradually across the District. Most business contacts planned to either increase   staff levels or leave them unchanged. Firms that plan to increase employment   were doing so in response to increased demand and because they have maximized   productivity with their existing staff. Staffing agencies continued to   experience high demand for temporary workers as well as an increase in   temp-to-hire positions. Some contacts reported difficulty finding qualified   candidates to fill specialized, higher skilled positions, especially in   healthcare and communications/technology sectors. Firms that are not increasing   employment cited high operating costs and uncertainty about future demand as   constraints to hiring plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Firms' expectations for unit cost increases have moderated slightly since the   beginning of the year as their outlook for labor and benefits costs were revised   down. However, prices of commodity-linked materials continued to rise and   downward price pressures from productivity gains were noted as tapering off.   District contacts continued to report that margins remain squeezed and their   ability to raise selling prices was mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The number of rigs   operating in the Gulf of Mexico is at roughly half the pre-Gulf of Mexico oil   spill level. Several energy infrastructure manufacturing firms noted an increase   in capital investment. The Mississippi River flooding has caused minor   disruption to river traffic, which, in turn, may affect production in some oil   refineries and chemical plants. The interruptions are expected to be   short-lived, and there are no reports of damage to transportation or energy   infrastructure.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much of the District experienced difficult weather conditions in April and   May. An abnormally cold, wet spring and severe storms have delayed planting in   some areas. Producers of poultry, cattle, and timber experienced losses as a   result of the tornadoes as well. Many farmers in Mississippi and Louisiana are   experiencing some degree of flooding from the Mississippi. Prices for many of   the District's agricultural products remained strong, particularly cotton,   soybeans, and beef, although the recent record-high cotton prices have declined   because of some pull back in global demand.
