      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Sixth District contacts indicated that business activity was mixed 
  in September. District merchants reported that sales exceeded expectations, 
  although auto sales were mixed. Home sales and housing construction continued 
  to trend lower in Florida, and there were reports of declining housing market 
  activity in other areas as well. In contrast, nonresidential construction continued 
  to expand modestly. Real estate loan demand moderated further, and an increase 
  in foreclosures was noted in parts of the District. Reports on manufacturing 
  and tourism were generally positive. Labor shortages were a source of wage pressure 
  in some industries, and cost increases related to energy and raw material prices 
  continued to be reported. Several businesses noted they had successfully raised 
  their output prices to offset a portion of the higher input costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that sales improved in September. Most merchants 
  noted that sales exceeded expectations and were above year-ago levels. Back-to-school 
  activity was particularly strong across the District, and the outlook among 
  most retailers remained positive. Reports of auto sales were mixed. Most domestic 
  brand dealers reported that sales of trucks and SUVs were disappointing in September, 
  and that inventories were too high. Some dealers noted that reduced prices and 
  new financing incentives helped to boost sales modestly later in the month. 
  Regional foreign brand distributors noted that sales were better in the Southeast 
  than the national average in September, but were off from year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Further declines were noted in District housing markets in September. The majority 
  of builders and Realtors reported that activity was down from a year ago and 
  inventories continued to rise. Weakness was most pronounced among Florida contacts, 
  while there were scattered reports that conditions deteriorated in parts of 
  Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee. According to contacts, new home construction 
  was below year-ago levels in most parts of the District. Reports from the Mississippi 
  Gulf Coast were more robust, whereas reports from New Orleans indicated that 
  the pace of construction continued at low levels. Contacts suggested that the 
  high cost of insurance remained a major problem for property owners in the Gulf 
  coast area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from commercial builders indicated that nonresidential construction 
  in the District was slightly stronger in September compared with a year earlier. 
  However, contacts also reported that rising material costs caused highway and 
  road projects in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia to be scaled back. Most reports 
  anticipated continued modest growth in nonresidential activity over the next 
  several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on manufacturing production in September were generally positive. Activity 
  related to the energy sector was especially strong. A refiner was adding personnel 
  and a major shipbuilder received a contract to provide support vessels for the 
  offshore oil and gas industries. Steel industry contacts also reported good 
  results. Reports on capital outlays and future spending plans were mixed. For 
  instance, many contacts reported that capital investments were directed toward 
  increasing energy efficiency rather than adding to capacity. Reports from the 
  transportation sector varied. Some trucking companies noted slower activity, 
  especially those dealing with homebuilders. Meanwhile, regional rail companies 
  were encouraged by the steady growth in the volume of inter-modal container 
  shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the tourism sector were generally positive in September. Passenger 
  traffic at Orlando International Airport was up over two percent from a year 
  ago, and central Florida theme park attendance was described as solid. Three 
  casinos recently reopened on the Mississippi coast, boosting the near term economic 
  outlook for that area. In New Orleans, however, the reduced number of tourists 
  and conventions continued to hamper the industry's recovery there. Industry 
  contacts expect tourist activity in New Orleans to pickup after the hurricane 
  season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Slowing loan demand, aggressive competition for deposits, and strong credit 
  quality, characterized reports from the District's banking sector in September. 
  Weaker real estate loan demand was noted in most parts of the District, while 
  reports on commercial and industrial lending were softer than in the last report. 
  Higher foreclosure rates were reported in parts of the region as increased interest 
  rates affected borrowers with adjustable rate mortgages. However, bank credit 
  quality indicators remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor shortages persisted in parts of the District. Some manufacturers reported 
  that they had raised their entry-level wages in an effort to attract workers. 
  Several residential construction firms continued to note difficulty in obtaining 
  qualified construction workers, despite the slowdown in building activity. A 
  spokesman for one staffing firm said that demand for skilled engineering and 
  finance specialists was strong. However, another staffing firm reported that 
  the overall demand for temporary workers had leveled off in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many of the companies contacted stated that they have been able to pass on 
  at least some of their cost increases to their customers. However, a concrete 
  products manufacturing company had to absorb recent energy, freight, and raw 
  material cost increases because of the slowdown in homebuilding. Property insurance 
  premium increases continued to be a major concern for businesses in coastal 
  areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought conditions moderated slightly across the District, but growers in Alabama 
  and Georgia remained concerned about the impact of the summer drought on cotton 
  and peanut yields. Meanwhile, Florida citrus producers have benefited from higher 
  prices for oranges this year. Despite weaker export demand attributed to international 
  concerns about Avian influenza, lower poultry prices have reportedly encouraged 
  some large export orders from China, Russia, and Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      High energy prices and a calm hurricane season resulted in a significant expansion 
  of exploration in the Gulf of Mexico in recent months. According to initial 
  estimates, a new, large find in the deep waters of the Gulf has the potential 
  to double U.S. crude oil reserves.
