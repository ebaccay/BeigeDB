      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Second District has slowed  since the last report, though the labor market has remained fairly firm. Manufacturers report some weakening in  business activity as of early December but note some improvement in early  January. In general, contacts outside the manufacturing sector report little or  no growth in business activity but some pickup in hiring. Retailers indicate that sales were relatively  weak for the holiday season overall (November and December). Tourism activity in New York City has remained strong. Housing markets remain mixed but mostly weak,  with the exception of Manhattan's co-op and condo  market. Office markets in and around New York City were stable in the fourth  quarter: vacancy rates are little changed since the last report, while asking  rents are up slightly. Finally, bankers  report weakening loan demand across the board, particularly for home mortgages,  tightening credit standards in all categories, and rising delinquency rates,  particularly on consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report mixed but generally weak sales  results for the holiday season. Overall,  it appears that sales were flat to up modestly from 2006 levels. One major retail chain reports that  same-store sales in the District were on plan, rising 5 percent from a year  earlier, whereas another indicates that sales were below plan, falling more  than 3 percent. Separately, a trade  association survey of retailers across New York State indicates that sales were  somewhat disappointing, with two in five indicating weaker sales than in  2006. In general, sales are reported to  have picked up moderately after Christmas and into early January. Geographically, sales were reported to be  relatively strong in New York City stores, as well as at those  in the Buffalo area, with strength in the  latter attributed to large numbers of Canadian shoppers.
     </p>
     Tourism activity in New York City remained strong through  year-end. Hotels remained at close to  full capacity in November and December.  Hotel occupancy rates were reported to be close to 90 percent in both  November and December, with room rates running roughly 13 percent ahead of a  year earlier. Broadway theaters report  that attendance and revenues bounced back in December, following the strike  that shut down many shows for the final three weeks of November. Both attendance  and revenues were down roughly 4 percent from a year earlier in December but  still at relatively strong levels.  Regional surveys point to declining consumer confidence in the final  months of 2007. Based on the Conference  Board's survey of Middle Atlantic residents, confidence fell for the third  straight month in December and was at its lowest level in over two years. Siena College's survey of New York State residents shows confidence  falling sharply in November and holding steady at a low level in December.
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Office markets in the New York City area were generally stable  in December and for the fourth quarter overall, with Manhattan's market remaining tighter  than those in the surrounding areas. There was some slowing in leasing activity  throughout the metro area, though vacancy rates were little changed, while  asking rents rose modestly. In Manhattan, the Downtown market  continued to tighten, offsetting some softening in Midtown. An industry contact notes that large rent  differentials are prompting some firms to move from Midtown to Downtown  Manhattan. Overall, Manhattan asking rents, which had  been rising sharply through the third quarter, flattened out somewhat in the  fourth quarter, though they continued to run roughly 25 percent ahead of a year  earlier. The only other market  registering double-digit rent increases over the past year is Fairfield County, Connecticut.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing markets in the  District continue to be mixed. Manhattan's co-op and condo market  showed continued resilience in the fourth quarter. A major appraisal firm reports an outsized  increase in the average transaction price in the fourth quarter but attributes  this mainly to a shift in the mix of units to newer, high-end condos; this  contact estimates that prices of comparable units are up roughly 6 percent from  a year earlier in Manhattan, with unit sales up 3 percent from a year  earlier. In contrast, on Long Island, both prices and sales  continue to run below year-ago levels.  More broadly, reports from Realtors across New York State indicate increasingly weak  market conditions for single-family homes, with prices down roughly 10 percent  from a year ago and unit sales down 15 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A major New York City  employment agency, specializing in office jobs, describes hiring activity as  surprisingly brisk in December, which is usually a slow month; hiring demand  remained strong from the legal industry and the financial sector--largely hedge  funds and private equity firms. The supply  of qualified office workers continues to be characterized as sparse.
      </p>
      <p>
       New York State manufacturers report that  business activity weakened somewhat as of early December, but note some  improvement in recent weeks. However,  contacts report some further pullback in hiring activity, as well as hiring  plans; they also express considerably less optimism, in general, about the six  month outlook than in recent months.  Manufacturers report continued widespread escalation in prices paid and  prices received--both current and expected.  Overall, non-manufacturing firms in the District report little or no  growth in the level of business activity and express considerably less optimism  about the general outlook than a few months ago. Unlike manufacturers, though, these contacts  report a pickup in hiring and expect their employment levels to increase, on  balance, in the first half of 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Small- to medium-sized banks report falling  demand for all types of loans--particularly in the residential mortgage  category, where more than four in five respondents indicate declining  demand. There were also fairly  widespread declines in demand for consumer loans, and in refinancing  activity. For all loan categories, respondents  indicate further tightening of credit standards. No bankers reported eased standards in any  loan category. Overall, the extent of  tightening was comparable to the prior (November 2007) survey. Consistent with weakening demand, bankers  report a decline in the spreads of loan rates over cost of funds for all types  of loans. Again, the decline was most  pronounced in the residential mortgage category. Bankers also reported a decrease in the  average deposit rate. Finally, respondents indicate increases in delinquencies  across all loan categories--most notably for consumer loans, where increases are  reported to be more widespread than at any time in at least 13 years.
