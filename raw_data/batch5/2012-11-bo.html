      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Reports from business contacts in the First District reflect a growing economy,   although the pace of growth appears to be somewhat slower than in the last   round. Retailers cite mixed sales results, manufacturers note slow growth, and   software and IT services firms report disappointing results. By contrast,   staffing firms are seeing a pick-up in growth. Commercial real estate contacts   indicate that fundamentals remain flat, and sentiment has soured somewhat in   recent weeks; residential real estate respondents say growth in home sales has   slowed but home prices are rising modestly in some areas. Hurricane Sandy   reportedly had very modest effects on economic activity in New England. Prices   are said to be level in general, with minimal inflationary pressures. While some   firms cite shortages of specialized workers, few are hiring, none extensively,   and no one mentions upward wage pressures.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers contacted for   this round report that year-over-year October sales changes ranged from   single-digit decreases to single-digit increases. A durable goods retailer   reported a large single-digit decrease which they attributed to a decline in   customer traffic related to preparations for and the aftermath of Hurricane   Sandy. Sales of adult apparel and home furnishings continue to be strong. Some   retailers have increased their hiring in anticipation of the holiday season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondents say that prices are holding steady and they do not see   inflationary pressures. Many contacts are actively managing inventories to   remain nimble and some are undertaking multi-year plans to better position their   businesses for the future in which the Internet will account for an increasing   share of sales. Because of the so-called fiscal cliff, there is some uncertainty   about what to expect in terms of tax policy; this is viewed as particularly   affecting planning by small businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing   respondents give a general picture of weak growth. Of the 10 firms contacted   this cycle, all but one report growth versus the period a year earlier but only   four report higher year-on-year growth versus the previous quarter. Similarly   mixed numbers appear across other measures, with three firms reporting an   improved outlook, four reporting higher employment and four reporting higher   capital expenditures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firms that are growing attribute growth to idiosyncratic factors and not to   the economy. A pet healthcare firm plans for 7.5 percent growth in 2012 but says   it is all the result of "innovation" and not the economy. A manufacturer of   medical equipment said government spending on VA hospitals had led to a large   increase in demand for its products. A semiconductor equipment manufacturing   firm reported a dramatic reduction in its expected sales in the fourth quarter.   As in recent Beige Book rounds, they blame this on the semiconductor equipment   "cycle."
      </p>
      <p>
       We continue to hear occasional complaints of difficulty finding qualified   workers. A pharmaceutical manufacturer reports hiring 75 new people this year   but still having 58 openings which they have been trying to fill "for a long   time" and which "they do not anticipate to be able to fill this year..." They   attribute the difficulty to their need for "highly qualified scientists with   specific sets of skills." A manufacturer of analytical laboratory equipment   finds it "increasingly difficult to find qualified people in China."
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, manufacturing contacts' recent weakness has not yet led them to   revise substantially their capital expenditure plans. That said, many of these   plans involve spending outside the United States. For example, a manufacturer of   lab equipment is spending almost 50 percent more this year than is typical, but   all that increment involves a new plant in England; capital expenditure in the   U.S. is entirely on maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New England   software and information technology services contacts generally report   weaker-than-expected activity through October, with revenues in the third   quarter roughly on par with year-earlier levels. The downtick in activity   reportedly reflects heightened political and economic uncertainty, which has   rendered many potential clients unwilling to commit to projects. Many contacts   report increasing difficulty in executing large license agreements, particularly   in Europe, where one contact says sluggishness in the manufacturing sector led   to a year-over-year decline in license revenue of nearly 40 percent. Delays in   contract signings and project starts have led many respondent firms to slow the   pace at which they are hiring; one contact may reduce headcount modestly in   coming months, after hiring "in advance of anticipated need" earlier this year.   Capital and technology spending and selling prices have gone largely unchanged   since February.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking forward, New England software and IT contacts are generally less   upbeat than they were three and six months ago, with many expressing growing   concerns regarding the "fiscal cliff" and macroeconomic conditions in Europe.   Most expect only modest growth through Q1 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Staffing Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New England staffing firms generally   report improved business conditions, with most describing business since Labor   Day as "pretty good." Year-over-year revenue changes in the third quarter varied   widely, from down slightly to up by about 20 percent. Labor demand is up   slightly in the IT and engineering sectors, and one contact reports renewed   activity in the manufacturing sector. However, demand for office and clerical   assistants and accountants remains weak. In terms of labor supply, candidates   with high-end skill sets such as nurses, mechanical and electric engineers, and   software developers remain hard to find. In addition, one contact reports that   turnover has recently decreased, as those with jobs are hunkering down for the   holiday season. Nevertheless, bill rates and pay rates have gone largely   unchanged since August. The outlook among New England staffing contacts is   generally consistent with that of three months ago, with most expecting more   robust growth in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       According to contacts across the   First District, commercial real estate fundamentals were roughly flat in recent   weeks amid light leasing activity. In Hartford, downtown office vacancy rates   (as percentages) remain in the mid-20s, although absorption could improve in the   coming months if pending lease deals go through. A Providence contact also sees   some chance of significant absorption in the downtown office market but noted   downside risks linked to macroeconomic conditions. In Portland, leasing activity   in recent months remained light and fell below expectations, resulting in flat   rental rates. In Boston, office fundamentals showed modest improvements in the   third quarter, but leasing inquiries have reportedly fallen off recently amid   concern over the fiscal cliff. Sales activity in Boston also softened, despite   prior expectations that property owners would rush to take capital gains at   current tax rates in light of pending 2013 rate increases. The multifamily   sector remains strong in Hartford and Boston, with rents rising as much as 10   percent over the year for some properties in greater Boston. Loan terms remain   highly favorable for high-quality properties and a regional lender to commercial   real estate continues to experience record loan volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       A majority of contacts note that business sentiment soured recently, with the   national election results and the fiscal situation cited as key factors. The   outlook for commercial real estate among our contacts turned more pessimistic on   balance in light of these same factors and also, according to some, risks to   growth stemming from Europe and other parts of the world. While contacts report   no immediate impacts of Hurricane Sandy on the commercial real estate markets in   their respective cities, two contacts point out that insurance rates for   commercial structures along the Eastern seaboard are likely to rise going   forward, restraining development in some areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Sales growth slowed in September   throughout much of the First District among both the condominium and   single-family home markets. In the Greater Boston area, single-family home sales   actually declined, representing the first decrease in 15 consecutive months. By   contrast, condominium sales in Greater Boston rose, reaching historic levels for   the month of September. Slowing growth across much of the region was attributed   to the dwindling number of properties in the market and damped confidence in the   local economy. Most contacts note modest price appreciation. However, in Rhode   Island and Connecticut, prices declined compared to a year ago, but consistent   growth in sales is expected to place upward pressure on prices. First District   contacts remain fearful that ongoing declines in inventory levels will hurt the   selection of homes on the market and discourage buyers in the market. Some   contacts say homeowners interested in selling have been reluctant to list their   homes in anticipation of greater future price appreciation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outlooks for the coming month remain similar to previous reports in spite of   less robust growth recently. Contacts generally say the housing market continues   to recover and expect positive year-over-year growth in sales in the coming   months because of low interest rates and affordable prices; they also expect   modest appreciation in prices. Inventory levels are not expected to increase   until the Spring. Overall, contacts remain optimistic about the recovery in the   housing market, but caution that gains could be undermined by worsening economic   conditions.
