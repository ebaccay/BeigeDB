      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business contacts in the Sixth District indicated that economic activity   continued to expand at a modest pace in September and early October. Merchants   noted that retail sales decelerated slightly compared with the previous month,   although auto sales continued to advance at a solid pace. Tourism activity   remained robust throughout most of the District. Homebuilders and Real Estate   brokers reported that new and existing home sales remained weak and home prices   continued to decline. Commercial developers indicated that construction activity   increased moderately compared with weak year-ago levels, and brokers noted an   increase in relocation activity. Manufacturers reported a modest decline in   production and new orders. Weakness in loan demand persisted, according to   banking contacts as both consumers and businesses refrained from borrowing.   Hiring for permanent positions remained very subdued across most sectors.   Pricing pressures moderated somewhat as input costs declined or leveled off.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported   that sales decelerated slightly in September compared with the August results.   Reports were mixed among contacts with half noting that sales were below plan   and the remainder was evenly split between those reporting sales at or above   expectations. On a year-over-over basis, sales were generally higher although   traffic was lower. Most contacts anticipated that holiday sales would be similar   to 2010 results. Auto dealers reported that sales continued to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many retail contacts planned to raise prices, expecting to retract the   increases if customers pushed back. Merchants continued to aggressively discount   products to draw in traffic and have found it difficult to end such practices   because of concern over losing customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Leisure and business travel remained strong in the District. Occupancy rates   continued to improve, and both airport and cruise traffic were up. International   visitors bolstered activity, mainly in Florida. Group bookings and theme park   attendance were up in most areas. Overall, hospitality contacts expect a vibrant   holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential brokers   indicated that sales softened somewhat in September compared with the previous   month and were flat to slightly up compared with very weak levels from last   year. Florida brokers reported that home sales growth slowed. Outside of   Florida, Southeast brokers noted a modest pickup in sales growth. Cash purchases   by investors, second home buyers, international buyers, and retirees accounted   for much of the sales activity across most of the Southeast, according to   contacts. Existing home prices remained below year earlier levels. District   brokers anticipate only modest sales growth over the next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from District builders indicated that new home sales and construction   activity were largely unchanged in September and were slightly ahead of weak   levels from a year ago. Home builders continued to report that new home prices   were largely flat compared with the previous month and a year ago. Overall,   construction and new home sales growth are expected to be similar to weak   year-ago levels over the next several months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Half of District commercial contractors polled reported that construction   activity in September exceeded the first half of the year, while just under   one-third signaled that activity was weaker. Backlogs reportedly increased   modestly as well. The outlook among contractors remained weak as most   anticipated commercial development to be flat or down on a year-over-year basis   for the remainder of 2011 and into 2012. Commercial brokers remarked that market   dynamics continued to largely favor tenants in the District, particularly in the   retail sector. However, some reports indicated that available office space had   declined, and with little new office development underway, this could result in   an increase in rental rates. An opposing view shared by some contacts was that   smaller blocks of office space remained abundant on a sub-lease basis from   tenants that have downsized, but are still paying for unused space. Corporate   expansion and relocation interest has picked up in some markets, which could   have a positive impact on inventory and construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall, manufacturers   indicated a modest decline in new orders and production levels in September. In   addition, fewer contacts noted plans to raise production in the near term.   Energy exploration and extraction firms cited investing more in capital goods,   which is expected to help equipment producers and suppliers. Auto manufacturers   reported that the impact from the disaster in Japan had waned and that   production is back to normal. Firms stated that they were increasing investment   in technology-based equipment as a means to increase efficiency.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts reported that volumes of shipments were above last year's levels,   and that chemical and agricultural goods shipments, in particular, were strong.   Rail contacts noted that shipments of energy and food-related products were   driving increases in activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking contacts indicated continued   weak loan demand. Loan growth remains a concern for banks in the Sixth District.   Lending levels continued to fall as new opportunities remained highly elusive   and very competitive. Deposits increased as people and businesses added to their   savings. The majority of large firms continued to have ready access to cash and   lines of credit, while some small firms and many new firms that sought credit   continued to experience difficulty. There were reports of non-bank entities,   like private equity firms and groups of wealthy individuals, becoming   increasingly interested in small business lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employers continued to manage their   labor supply very tightly. Most contacts indicated that the outlook for hiring   remained restrained by modest expectations regarding future sales. Several   reports suggested that permanent employees were primarily being used to maintain   a firm's core business, while specific projects were being assigned to   contractors and temporary hires. Firms continued to seek efficiency gains   through investment in technology and other cost-saving applications. Hiring   contacts highlighted having difficulties finding qualified candidates for   specialized positions, in some cases, because of a lack of geographic mobility   for potential hires. For lower wage positions, agencies reported numerous   employment opportunities; however, the positions were contingent on passing   skills tests and/or background checks, which many applicants failed.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, contacts reported that input prices had receded or leveled off   from earlier this year. Retailers continued to heavily discount products.   Businesses mentioned pursuing various cost-cutting measures in order to support   positive margins. Manufacturers noted general success passing on earlier   increases in commodity prices. Any plans to increase wages were generally   limited to employees with a high degree of technical skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District oil and gas   production declined in early September as energy producers reduced offshore   operations and vacated staff in the path of Tropical Storm Lee in the Gulf of   Mexico. Industry contacts indicated that plans to invest in increased production   capacity were proceeding. In particular, contacts reported that new drilling   technology had reduced costs and increased extraction capabilities for both oil   and gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Drought conditions persisted in much of Georgia and parts of Alabama. High   livestock feed costs were pressuring poultry producers but were being   successfully passed on by cattle producers. Corn prices remained elevated and   cotton prices paid to farmers increased modestly since the last report, although   cotton futures prices have declined somewhat further in recent weeks.   Agriculture contacts continued to report concerns over labor shortages and   production issues that they tied to recently passed immigration laws in some   states.
