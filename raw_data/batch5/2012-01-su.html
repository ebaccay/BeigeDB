      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and   based on information collected on or before December 30, 2011. This document   summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <hr width="600"/>
     <p>
      Contact reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that   national economic activity expanded at a modest to moderate pace during the   reporting period of late November through the end of December. Seven Districts   characterized growth as modest; of the remaining five, New York and Chicago   noted a pickup in the pace of growth, Dallas and San Francisco reported moderate   growth, and Richmond indicated that activity flattened or improved slightly.   Compared with prior summaries, the reports on balance suggest ongoing   improvement in economic conditions in recent months, with most Districts   highlighting more favorable conditions than identified in reports from the late   spring through early fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending picked up in most Districts, reflecting significant gains   in holiday retail sales compared with last year's season, and activity in the   travel and tourism sector expanded in most areas. Demand strengthened further   for nonfinancial services, including professional and transportation services.   Manufacturing activity generally continued to expand, although the pace of   growth has slowed for selected subsectors such as technology products.   Agricultural producers and extractors of natural resources reported generally   robust conditions. Activity stayed sluggish in residential real estate markets,   and conditions in commercial real estate markets remained somewhat soft overall   but showed signs of ongoing improvement in several Districts. Reports from   financial institutions generally indicated a slight uptick in loan demand by   businesses, along with improvements in overall credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward price pressures and price increases remained quite limited for most   categories of final goods and services, as the effects of prior increases in the   costs of selected inputs have eased. Upward wage pressures were modest overall,   although a few Districts noted substantial compensation increases for workers   with specialized skills in selected sectors and regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on consumer   spending were favorable in general. Most Districts reported that holiday retail   sales were up noticeably over last year's season, with New York and Dallas   describing sales as "brisk" and "robust," respectively. Consumer spending and   confidence generally were characterized as firmer than in recent reporting   periods, although Kansas City reported that spending softened. Items identified   as the strongest holiday sellers by various Districts included consumer   electronics and jewelry, and Chicago noted that luxury items in general sold   well during the holiday season. By contrast, many Districts reported weak sales   and excess inventories of warm clothing, due to unusually mild weather. Retail   inventories more broadly were reported to be at or near desired levels,   consistent with retailers' sales expectations. Boston, New York, and Minneapolis   noted exceptional growth in Internet sales for selected items. Sales of new   automobiles continued to pick up in most Districts. Among the more favorable   reports, Atlanta noted that the pace of auto sales in November and December was   "the strongest in over two years," and strong demand and sales were reported as   well by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from most Districts pointed to solid gains or high levels of travel   and tourist activity, with pickups evident in both the business and leisure   segments. Tourism activity was reported to be above the levels from twelve   months earlier by Boston, New York, Richmond, and Atlanta, and Boston contacts   expect double-digit growth in hotel revenues in 2012. By contrast, Minneapolis   reported that tourist activity was down because limited snowfall has stymied   outdoor activities such as skiing and snowmobiling, while Kansas City reported a   decline because winter storms hampered some tourist activity. Business travel   activity also has expanded of late and is above levels from twelve months   earlier, according to Atlanta and San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand generally strengthened   further for nonfinancial services. Providers of professional and business   services such as consulting, advertising, engineering, and legal services   expanded their activities according to Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, and   Minneapolis. Sales of technology services to businesses and consumers grew   further, according to Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, although the   pace of growth slowed from earlier in 2011. Providers of temporary staffing   services saw strong and rising demand in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, and   Richmond Districts but below-average seasonal hiring in the Chicago and Dallas   Districts. Reports from the health-care sector generally pointed to growth as   well, with Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis highlighting construction   activity and bank lending aimed at health-care providers. The exception to   growing demand for health-care services was San Francisco, which reported an   ongoing decline in hospital admissions. Demand for shipping and transportation   services generally expanded. New York and Atlanta reported a significant   increase in shipping tonnage by truck, and Dallas noted a broad-based increase   in shipments by rail. Atlanta reported that port activity was up over twelve   months earlier due to "notable strength in exports," while Richmond reported a   decline in port activity that was largely attributed to reduced imports. Air   travel was above year-ago levels in the Atlanta District but unchanged over the   past six weeks in the Dallas District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded in most   Districts, generally continuing its steady overall expansion or, in the case of   Atlanta, reversing a slowdown in prior periods. For the sector as a whole,   further growth or improved conditions were reported by almost all Districts,   except for Cleveland, Richmond, and Dallas, which reported that activity was   largely stable or mixed, and Kansas City, which noted a slight decline. The   strongest reports came from subsectors such as heavy equipment manufacturing and   steel, for which demand has been boosted by robust growth in the energy,   agricultural, and auto manufacturing sectors. Reports from Cleveland, Richmond,   Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis confirmed vibrant activity for auto   manufacturers, primarily for domestic makes. By contrast, demand remained   somewhat weak for firms in housing-related subsectors, such as a door   manufacturer in the Richmond District, furniture manufacturers there and in the   St. Louis and San Francisco Districts, and makers of lumber and wood products in   the San Francisco District. Demand for computers and related electronic   components rose further, according to Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.   However, the pace of growth has slowed significantly from earlier in 2011, and   Boston noted declining sales of semiconductors, mainly due to weaker demand from   Asia. According to Dallas and San Francisco, aircraft makers saw further demand   increases. Those Districts also noted weak domestic demand for refined petroleum   products that was largely or completely offset by robust foreign demand. Demand   grew smartly for food producers in the Philadelphia and Dallas Districts, but in   the Kansas City District food processing was one of the weakest performers   within the manufacturing sector. Export sales of assorted manufactured products   generally performed well according to Atlanta and Chicago, although slower   economic growth in China and Europe held back sales for some manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cleveland reported that capacity utilization remained below normal in most   subsectors, with the notable exception of steel producers, who were operating at   or near normal levels. Similarly, Chicago noted that some auto suppliers appear   to be approaching capacity constraints, which may limit further production   increases in the near term. Atlanta reported that recent flooding in Thailand   was likely to exert modest restraint on auto production. Ongoing capital   investments and increases in capacity were reported for various manufacturing   concerns in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts and for an auto producer in   the Richmond District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in residential real   estate markets largely held steady at very low levels, with the exception of   further increases in the construction of multifamily residences. The pace of   single-family home sales remained quite sluggish throughout the country,   although the Dallas District reported a modest increase over the prior reporting   period. Some Districts, such as Boston and Atlanta, noted that home sales   exceeded levels from twelve months earlier, but mainly because the earlier   levels reflected a substantial drop following the expiration of the homebuyers'   tax credit in mid-2010. Prices were largely stable on a short-term basis in most   areas but in many instances were below their levels from twelve months earlier.   Extensive inventories of distressed properties were reported to be a source of   price restraint in the Boston, Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts.   Construction of single-family homes remained at depressed levels in most areas   and fell further in some, such as the Philadelphia, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and   Kansas City Districts. However, Cleveland reported that activity improved during   the past couple of months. In contrast to the soft market for single-family   residences, the market for rental units tightened in some areas such as the New   York and Richmond Districts, and construction of multifamily residences rose in   the Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for nonresidential real estate remained somewhat soft overall but   improved in a number of Districts. Vacancy rates and other indicators in markets   for office space were largely unchanged in the major metropolitan markets in the   Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and St. Louis Districts. By contrast,   New York reported that demand for office space "picked up in late 2011," causing   vacancy rates to edge down and asking rents to rise. Minneapolis, Kansas City,   Dallas, San Francisco, Atlanta, and Chicago all reported stronger demand for   commercial real estate compared with earlier in 2011, and the latter two   Districts also noted a pickup in nonresidential construction activity. Cleveland   and Chicago reported that the strongest demand and most extensive construction   activity has been for industrial and health-care facilities, while Minneapolis   highlighted growing demand for industrial space and San Francisco stressed   growing demand emanating from the information technology sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity edged up overall,   primarily due to increased loan demand by businesses. Most Districts that   commented on lending activity indicated little or no change in overall loan   demand, but the remaining Districts identified increases rather than decreases.   New York reported a pronounced increase in demand for commercial mortgages, and   Cleveland also noted increased demand in this category. Both Dallas and San   Francisco noted a slight uptick in commercial and industrial lending. Consumer   lending was largely flat compared with the prior reporting period, although auto   loans rose in Cleveland. New York, Philadelphia, and Cleveland reported demand   growth or continued strength for refinancing of residential mortgages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending standards were largely unchanged across all lending categories.   However, New York reported slight tightening for commercial and industrial   loans. Moreover, a few reports highlighted that small businesses continued to   struggle with credit access through banks. In the Atlanta District, some small   businesses have turned to nonbank institutions for financing, and in the Chicago   District some manufacturers have been financing loans to their suppliers from   retained earnings. Credit quality improved in many Districts: New York reported   a decline in delinquency rates for all loan categories, while Philadelphia,   Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco all reported general   improvement in loan quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for agricultural   products was strong during the reporting period, but growing conditions and   input prices were mixed. Farm income and profits were reported to be at very   high levels by Chicago and Kansas City, enabling many farmers to repay loans and   expand their operations, and San Francisco reported further sales growth for a   variety of agricultural products. Rising foreign demand was noted as a source of   strength for livestock sales in the Atlanta and Dallas Districts and for dairy   and meat products in the Chicago District. Growing conditions were somewhat   mixed across areas. Farmers and livestock producers in the Atlanta and Dallas   Districts have been struggling with ongoing droughts, which have required costly   responses such as supplemental feeding of livestock. While timely rains eased   drought conditions somewhat in the Dallas and Kansas City Districts, wheat   farmers in the latter are hoping for more protective snow cover for the winter   crop's dormancy period. In addition, high or rising prices for some inputs were   noted by Chicago and Kansas City, tempering farmers' profit expectations for the   coming year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand and extraction activity rose further for producers of natural resource   products. Energy extraction has been on the upswing. Atlanta reported that   companies have been expanding their workforces and increasing their production   capacity and exploration plans in the Gulf of Mexico. Minneapolis and Kansas   City reported that oil and gas exploration and extraction activity were well   above their levels from twelve months earlier, and Dallas noted that a high   level of activity is expected to resume in early 2012 following a year-end   seasonal lull. Minneapolis and San Francisco reported expansion of mining   capacity and activity for a range of industrial and precious metals.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures and price   increases were very limited during the reporting period. Reports from various   Districts, including Boston, Atlanta, and Chicago, indicated that upward price   pressures from rising commodity and input prices have eased substantially, with   Boston noting that "even food prices have ceased rising." Atlanta reported that   firms have limited pricing power in general, and San Francisco pointed to   intense supplier competition as a factor holding down prices. Similarly, Kansas   City reported a recent uptick in input prices but noted that few manufacturers   passed these increases on to the prices of their finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage pressures remained modest overall. The combination of limited permanent   hiring in most sectors and numerous active job seekers has continued to keep a   lid on general wage increases. However, reports from a few Districts highlighted   significant supply constraints and in some cases large compensation increases   for workers with specialized skills in selected sectors, including the energy   sector in the Dallas District and the technology sector in the San Francisco   District. On a related note, Minneapolis reported that employers have increased   relocation pay for employees willing to settle in parts of that District where   worker availability is limited. Increases in the costs of employee health   benefits continued to put significant upward pressure on overall compensation   costs, although some employers in the Philadelphia District reported significant   rollbacks from past increases.
