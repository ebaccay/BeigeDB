      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21 , 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most sectors in the Fifth District reported either mixed or improving   business conditions since our last assessment. Manufacturing continued to lead   most other sectors, with solid increases in orders and shipments and even a   small gain in employment. Services firms also strengthened, although employment   tended to be flat. Finance and real estate (both residential and commercial)   firms reported improvements over the last four-to-six weeks, but weaknesses were   noted especially in industrial real estate. In contrast, the retail sector   tended to be either flat or down in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Temporary employment was   more evenly mixed between reports of strengthening and weakening, but with more   optimism expressed than earlier. Reports of wage and price changes among sectors   indicated little change, although manufacturing and retail price growth slowed   slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail contacts generally reported flat or   declining sales in recent weeks, although a few reported an uptick in late   September and early October. An executive at a sporting goods store said   unemployment was keeping his sales flat, while department store executives in   some locations reported that sales had dropped. In contrast, several store   managers at chain department stores indicated that sales had strengthened. A   Charlotte store manager reported strong sales of electronics, especially larger   flat screen televisions, but he added that, "we're not coming out of the   downturn yet." A contact at a large bookstore said sales were up, but the store   was continuing to reduce hours in order to contain expenses. Dealers told us   sales of cars and light trucks declined, though not markedly, since the   cash-for-clunkers program ended. Merchants continued to cut jobs in recent   weeks, but reductions were less widespread than cited in our last report. The   rate of retail price increases slowed slightly, while the pace of wage increases   edged up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenue growth at services firms strengthened   since our last report. Most hospitals and other healthcare facilities had   slightly higher consumer demand for services in recent weeks; however, flu   outbreaks were not extensive and contacts said they have not had to enact   emergency pandemic plans. Executives at telecommunications firms told us their   revenues were up. Employment was generally flat, with the exception of some   financial services and technical firms where employment increased. An architect   in Baltimore also said hiring increased at his firm. Price and wage inflation at   services-providing firms was relatively stable since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued   to advance in September. Contacts reported solid increases in shipments and new   orders, and indicated that employment had increased for the first time since   December 2007. A contact at a tire plant reported that positive sales   transferred into increased production after inventory projections were achieved.   Moreover, a machinery parts manufacturer said that automotive demand was   tremendous because original equipment manufacturers were rebuilding their   inventory. A door manufacturer observed that over the last several months   precipitous year-over-year drops in new orders had abated, with new orders now   only slightly lower than last year. He was concerned, however, that the firming   of new orders would only be temporary due to the ending of the new homebuyers'   tax credit. Contacts reported that both raw materials and finished goods prices   increased at a slower pace than in our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Port authorities in the District reported stable-to-moderate gains in both   import and export activity, but expressed concern about their sustainability.   One official saw "light at the end of the tunnel," with month-to-month changes   flattening out. Auto imports picked up as auto companies replenished dealer   stocks. Another official thought that modest gains over the last month might   reverse once the early holiday importing was completed, especially if businesses   kept a tight rein on inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending demand around the Fifth District was   mixed since our last report, although banks reported modest signs of   improvement. Consumer loan demand picked up "modestly," according to several   bankers from areas least affected by the economic downturn. However, most   borrowers with excellent credit and an established relationship received loans.   Some of the gains were attributed to the recent jump in new car sales, but   increased borrowing for other consumer durables was also noted. Demand for   C&amp;I loans was about evenly split between reports of recent improvement and   further weakening. Several banks reported that local businesses with relatively   healthy balance sheets thought their markets had finally hit bottom and they   were ready to start investing again. However, a number of banks reported sharp   declines in loan demand in recent weeks, noting weakness in the energy, auto   parts, and metals markets. Finally, mortgage lending in most areas of the   District saw a pickup that was widely attributed to first-time buyers and   bargain hunters, with both concentrated at the low end of the market. The middle   and upper ends of the market remained weak, but one banker noted slight   increases in sales to second- and third-time buyers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District residential real estate agents   generally reported stronger traffic and actual sales of houses priced in the   low-to-middle range of their markets, citing first-time homebuyers and the   government's tax credit program as the driving force. Several agents reported   strong sales in September, based on not only gross sales revenue but also unit   sales. One agent expected October to be equally as busy, based on the number of   visitors at his open houses. Another agent reported that sales were "up a tad,"   and that the number of properties that went under contract increased in recent   months. In contrast, Realtors in North Carolina reported slow housing markets,   due partly to people taking their time to look and others being cautious because   of their credit status. Indeed, one agent told us that, "pristine credit is   practically required to get financing." Most Realtors reported that the low- to   middle-priced houses were their best sellers, and the higher-end properties   showed very slow sales in many areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      While commercial real estate activity in the District remained depressed,   most real estate agents reported signs of improvement over the last month at   least in terms of expressing interest in long-term expansion. One agent noted an   increase in foot traffic from retailers interested in developing new sites next   year. Few were willing to commit yet, but an increasing number were revisiting   earlier expansion plans that had been put on hold over the last year. Industrial   real estate activity in most areas of the District was often described as   "dead," and new construction of industrial or office buildings was further   deterred by difficulty obtaining financing. Small business startups in Northern   Virginia were also having trouble getting financing, often due to an inability   to meet higher down-payment requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Assessments of tourist activity varied in recent   weeks, but were generally on the positive side. Contacts along the coast   reported firmer bookings since our last report, facilitated by good weather and   increased short-term stays. A contact from Myrtle Beach told us that occupancy   rates had risen and were much improved over last year. He noted that, although   the average length of stay had declined, more people were traveling to the   destination. A contact on the Outer Banks of North Carolina indicated that   bookings for the Columbus Day holiday weekend were somewhat stronger than a year   ago, which she attributed to "visitors being a little more positive." In   contrast, other hoteliers on the coast described business as somewhat weaker   compared with our last report. A manager at a mountain lodge in West Virginia   reported a 10 percent increase in group bookings over last year, crediting its   proximity to neighboring urban areas. Similarly, a manager at a mountain resort   in Virginia characterized bookings for the Columbus Day holiday weekend as much   stronger, due to warm weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District temporary employment   agents gave generally mixed reports on demand for workers since our last report.   One agent reported stronger demand for his workers, citing the economic recovery   and a renewed confidence. In contrast, several contacts reported somewhat weaker   demand for workers. However, these contacts expected stronger demand over the   next few months because companies were beginning to see increases in activity   again and, therefore, would need additional temporary support. Indeed, an agent   in the Raleigh, N.C., area was very optimistic for stronger demand over the next   several months due to an increase in manufacturing in preparation for the   holiday season demand and a temporary increase in businesses hiring office   workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      While agricultural harvesting and field   preparation were on schedule, farm income projections weakened somewhat since   our last report. Recent weather conditions allowed Fifth District farmers to   make steady progress in harvesting, with the corn harvest in full swing in North   Carolina and winding down in South Carolina. The corn harvest in Virginia was   nearing completion with yields described as good to excellent. In addition, the   apple harvest was 80 percent complete in Maryland and 60 percent complete in   West Virginia. Farmers in Virginia and South Carolina were harvesting early   soybeans, which were in good-to-excellent condition. Results of our recent   survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated that farmland values were   above both the previous quarter and year-ago levels, but income projections   weakened as a result of continued lower commodity prices and weaker demand
