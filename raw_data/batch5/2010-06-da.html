      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions continued to improve in the Eleventh District. Activity   in manufacturing, staffing services, transportation services, housing and energy   grew modestly. Retail sales were flat to slightly down but in line with   retailers' expectations during the reporting period. While outlooks remained   positive, contacts from some industries noted concerns about how the European   debt crisis and recent stock market volatility would affect future business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most contacts said prices were holding steady,   although some paper, fabricated metals, and aircraft and parts manufacturers   reported slight increases in selling prices. Contacts at department stores said   less discounting was taking place. Input and raw material costs were generally   stable, but there were reports of an uptick in the cost of lumber, food,   engineered metal products, linerboard, steel and some industrial metals. Firms'   ability to pass on these cost increases remained limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crude oil prices dropped from $85 per barrel in early April to near $70 in   late May. Natural gas prices were flat during the reporting period. Sharp   increases in the price of petrochemicals such as ethylene and propylene seen   earlier are reversing as ethylene plants come back online and refineries   increase utilization rates. Declining prices have spurred export demand for U.S.   petrochemicals and related products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment levels held steady at several   respondent firms and there were a few reports of hiring activity. Staffing firms   continued to cite increased demand for their services, and some contacts in   transportation services, automotive sales, transportation and   construction-related manufacturing said they had either added a few employees or   planned on hiring additional workers. Wage pressures remained subdued, with the   exception of the airline industry. Many firms are continuing with salary or   401(k) contribution freezes, although a few noted that they planned on giving   small pay increases this year. In addition, staffing firms reported that pay   rates were stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most construction-related manufacturers   said demand ticked up from low levels. Orders from the public sector and   homebuilding industry have improved but demand for commercial construction   materials remains weak. A few contacts said they were slowly increasing work   hours or capacity utilization rates. Although there is still caution among   contacts, outlooks were slightly more optimistic than the last report.   Fabricated metals producers cited continued increases in demand, and reported   that large government-related projects have boosted the sales outlook for the   next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some high-tech manufacturers noted slight easing in export demand due to the   European fiscal crisis, while others said orders continued to grow at a   consistently strong pace. Inventories were reported to be under control and one   semiconductor respondent said they were able to increase inventories to desired   levels. Most respondents remain optimistic that demand will be strong over the   next six months but noted that the outlook has become more uncertain due to   fiscal problems in Europe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of trailers said continued strength in demand has boosted the   outlook over the next three months. Manufacturers of aircrafts and parts said   orders from the commercial and general aviation industry have improved, while   demand for government and military aircraft remains weak. An aircraft repair and   maintenance firm said demand strengthened over the past month, and is expected   to rise further over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from paper manufacturers were mixed. Most respondents reported strong   demand while one corrugated box manufacturer noted a decline in orders. Food   producers noted an increase in orders. Inventories are at desired levels but   some food manufacturers said stocking up for certain items has been an issue due   to the recent acceleration in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical producers cited improved domestic demand for most products   except for polyvinyl chloride, which is tied to commercial and residential   construction. Demand for oil products is above year-ago levels, and refinery   capacity utilization rates have risen from the low 80 percent range in early   April to the high 80s in late May. Refinery margins have improved and are at   their highest levels for the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity was flat to slightly down   but in line with contacts' expectations during the reporting period. Contacts   say the decline in sales was largely due to Easter pulling sales forward into   March. Department store sales were flat despite strong demand for apparel and   accessories. Most contacts say Texas sales are faring slightly better than the   national average, and same-store sales are on track to hit low single-digit   nominal growth this year. The outlook is for gradual improvement for the   remainder of the year, with some concern over the impact of Europe's fiscal   situation on consumer confidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile dealers said sales ticked up since the last report. Inventories   remain lean. Prices have been inching upwards due to some pullback in incentives   introduced earlier. Contacts expect demand will gradually improve through the   end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms say demand remains strong and   widespread across sectors. Orders are mostly for contract work but assignments   are becoming longer in length and temp-to-hire placements continue to pick up   pace. Sustained growth in demand has led contacts to expand staff levels and has   boosted the near-term outlook. Accounting firms note demand remains flat and the   outlook continues to be cautiously optimistic. Law firms report weak demand for   most types of legal services, with the exception of a slight pickup in   foreclosure-related activity. Contacts say that they will have fewer summer   clerkships than normal due to sluggish demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for transportation services was positive suggesting further   improvement in overall economic conditions. Intermodal cargo volumes were flat   over the past month but are slightly up from three months and year-ago levels.   Shipping firms say large freight volumes continued to grow strongly but small   parcel shipping volumes were flat over the reporting period. Railroads reported   a significant and broad-based increase in shipments, and noted that the outlook   is more upbeat than last time. Airlines cited further improvement in demand,   with leisure travel seeing continued growth and business travel recovering.   Contacts say domestic travel is rebounding but is not as strong as international   demand. The outlook is positive as revenues have improved due to fare increases   and advance bookings are holding up well.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing demand continued to   improve. Realtors reported positive gains in home sales as the homebuyer tax   credit contributed greatly to a wave of buying. Builders increased starts due to   tight new home inventories and improved sales activity. Prices were steady to   slightly higher, according to respondents. Still outlooks reflect uncertainty   about the remainder of the year and many contacts expect flat demand in the   second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment markets continue to fare better than expected, with occupancy and   rents improving in most Texas metros. While concessions are ongoing, contacts   noted they are not as widespread as earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate contacts said that although conditions remain weak,   there are signs that the sector is firming. Leases and property sales have   picked up as rents and prices have come down. Some contacts said there were a   few instances of property prices being "bid up" due to the large amount of   interested buyers versus the low amount of quality properties for sale. Despite   the improvement, the large amount of space available is expected to keep   commercial construction subdued for the remainder of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall loan demand softened during   the reporting period. There is more commercial and industrial loan activity in   the pipeline but consumer loan demand outside of credit cards remains sluggish.   Contacts report that they are turning down many potential mortgage borrowers due   to poor credit. Credit standards remain tight and loan pricing is unchanged.   Some contacts reported an increased inflow of deposits, which they attributed to   the unease arising from recent stock market volatility. Although contacts are   relieved that the Federal Reserve will retain regulatory oversight over state   member banks, there continues to be concern regarding other impending regulation   changes. The outlook is slightly optimistic with some concern about the impact   of the Greek credit crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The rig count rose further over the reporting   period and most of the increase was in oil-directed drilling. Even with the drop   in oil prices from $85 to $70 per barrel, oil-directed projects remain   profitable. In contrast, at $4 per mmbtu prices do not justify unhedged shale   gas drilling. Hence, as current hedges expire, contacts say that there will   likely be a slowdown in gas-directed drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lack of rainfall and high winds dried out the   topsoil in some areas but recent rains have restored much of the lost moisture.   Spring planting is moving ahead of its normal pace, and crop conditions are   significantly better than last year. Demand for several agricultural products   has improved and exports of cotton, rice and grains are up from last year.   Cattle and cotton prices have risen and remain strong, while grain prices have   weakened slightly.
