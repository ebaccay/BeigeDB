      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21,  2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and based   on information collected before October 13, 2009. This document summarizes   comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the 12 Federal Reserve Districts indicated either stabilization   or modest improvements in many sectors since the last report, albeit often from   depressed levels. Leading the more positive sector reports among Districts were   residential real estate and manufacturing, both of which continued a pattern of   improvement that emerged over the summer. Reports on consumer spending and   nonfinancial services were mixed. Commercial real estate was reported to be one   of the weakest sectors, although reports of weakness or moderate decline were   frequently noted in other sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of gains in economic activity generally outnumber declines, but   virtually every reference to improvement was qualified as either small or   scattered. For example, Dallas cited slight improvements residential real estate   and staffing firms, while New York noted gains only in a few sectors   (predominantly manufacturing and retail). Retail and manufacturing conditions   were mixed in Boston, but some signs of improvement were reported. New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, and San Francisco cited small pickups in manufacturing   activity. In the Kansas City District, an uptick was noted in technology firms,   while services firms posted revenue gains in Richmond. However, conditions were   referred to as stable or flat for business services and tourism firms in   Minneapolis and agriculture in St. Louis and Kansas City.
     </p>
     <p>
      The weakest sector was commercial real estate, with conditions described as   either weak or deteriorating across all Districts. Banking also faltered in   several Districts, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting continued erosion   in credit quality (often with more expected in the future). One bright spot in   the banking sector was lending to new homebuyers, in response to the first-time   homebuyer tax credit. Finally, labor markets were typically characterized as   weak or mixed, but with occasional pockets of improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts generally reported little or no increase to either price or wage   pressures, but references to downward pressures were occasionally noted. While   upward price pressures were generally subdued in most Districts, materials   prices increased in Cleveland (mainly for steel) and Kansas City. Manufactured   goods prices were flat to up slightly in Boston. Boston reported that in some   market segments "product competition and customer clout are leading to downward   pressure on prices." Minimal wage pressures were noted in Cleveland and   Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending remained   weak in most Districts since the last report, although some improvements were   noted. Chicago reported a continued decrease but at a slower rate than in the   previous reporting period, and retailers maintained low inventories. Richmond   reported flat or declining sales; Dallas indicated sales were largely unchanged.   However, Dallas reported unexpected weakness at value-based retailers. Sales   were mixed, according to Boston, St. Louis, and Kansas City, with Kansas City   citing strong sales of cold weather apparel and lower-priced goods. San   Francisco remarked that sales were little changed, with the exception of an   increase in furniture sales. Although New York observed weak sales in upstate   New York, general merchandise retailers in the City were ahead of plan and   same-store sales were roughly on par with a year earlier. Boston noted that   large-scale retailers had cut inventory due to weak sales. Philadelphia saw a   pickup in back-to-school shopping. Cleveland observed that consumers were very   price-sensitive and inventories were lean; nonetheless, sales were flat or   slightly improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      The "cash-for-clunkers" program ended in August, leaving depleted inventories   and slower sales in its wake. New vehicle sales declined in New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas,   and San Francisco. However, Chicago reported a pick-up in vehicle sales in early   October. Low new-car inventories helped to move used cars in several Districts,   although San Francisco commented that the demand for used cars also weakened.   New York also reported that automobile dealers saw some improvement in credit   conditions for consumers looking to purchase cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking to expectations for holiday sales, Chicago anticipated improved   sales, while Philadelphia retailers expected consumers to limit spending.   However, Third District merchants also noted that store traffic increased   recently. Atlanta reported that two-thirds of contacts expected flat or   declining sales over the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity varied across Districts. Boston, New York, and Atlanta   described business travel as extremely soft, whereas Richmond observed solid   growth in group bookings. Occupancy rates held steady in New York, spurred by   increased leisure visitors, while aggressive discounting boosted cruise-line   occupancy rates in Atlanta. San Francisco reported a deep slide in hotel and   resort visits in Southern California and Las Vegas, but noted a continued   firming of occupancy rates in Hawaii. Richmond indicated overall bookings were   much improved over last year, while Kansas City reported occupancy rates   remained below year-ago-levels. Room rates continued to decline in several   Districts, including New York and Atlanta. In contrast, Boston said that hotels   were offering dramatic promotional deals and discounts on local attractions,   which preserved posted room rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonfinancial services firms had   mixed reports in recent weeks. Kansas City observed increased demand for   high-tech services and Richmond noted generally increased revenues, particularly   in telecommunications and healthcare services. Demand for healthcare services   also picked up in the Boston District. Minneapolis observed that activity in   nonfinancial services firms was mostly flat at low levels, although technology   consultants reported an uptick and competition heated up among engineering   firms. In contrast, San Francisco contacts indicated that demand for services in   general fell, and elective medical procedures were being deferred. St. Louis   noted that revenues declined at several large firms in business support   services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation services activity generally declined, although Cleveland and   Chicago reported some strengthening. Atlanta observed weak transportation demand   overall, and firms in the San Francisco District indicated that trucking had   declined. Import demand in the Dallas District fell, leading to a reduction in   cargo volumes at intermodal firms. Activity in the transportation sector was   flat, according to Kansas City. In contrast, the cash-for-clunkers program   helped to clear dealership lots, which prompted dealers to restock their   depleted inventories and drove up car shipments. Chicago reported that trucking   shipments increased, although the level of activity remained low, and   Cleveland's contacts cited an uptick in freight transport volume in recent   weeks. Cleveland also noted that trucking companies planned substantial   equipment purchases through the first quarter of 2010. Business travel by air   declined since the last report, according to San Francisco, while airlines in   the Dallas District reported stabilized demand--albeit at low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported that manufacturing   activity was generally stronger since the last report. New York, Richmond,   Minneapolis and Kansas City all noted a further pickup in production, while   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco mentioned slight-to-moderate   increases. Growth rates varied by industry, however, and some Districts   experienced little or no overall increase. Boston reported that manufacturing   activity was mixed, but had stabilized or shown modest improvement in certain   industries. Similarly, Dallas said overall demand in manufacturing was flat at   weak levels albeit with pickups in the high-tech, food, and petrochemical   industries. St. Louis indicated that manufacturing continued its net decline,   and Atlanta noted moderate declines in orders and production. Some Districts   (Boston, Richmond and Chicago) mentioned that year-over-year drops in new orders   of housing-related products had abated. Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago   reported substantial increases in auto and parts production, which were   attributed primarily to restocking dealers' and manufacturers' inventories.   Accordingly, lean inventories and stronger demand from the auto sector led to an   increase in steel production in the Cleveland and Chicago Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Comments on the near-term outlook varied across Districts. Boston,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported that their contacts expected   only slight gains and modest economic growth during the next six months.   Therefore, capital spending plans remained subdued, and centered mostly on new   product development or cost reduction. Dallas indicated that planned projects   and routine maintenance were being deferred to conserve capital. New York,   however, reported that respondents were increasingly optimistic about the   near-term outlook and expected to hire more workers and spend more on   capital.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported that   housing market conditions improved in recent weeks, primarily from a pickup in   sales of low- to middle-priced houses. Contacts reported that sales were boosted   by the government's tax credit for first-time homebuyers. Resale activity also   edged up in parts of the New York District, although prices continued to be   depressed due to a substantial volume of foreclosures and short sales. New and   existing home sales remained flat in the Philadelphia District, and home sales   continued to decline throughout the St. Louis District. Sales of higher-priced   homes were very slow, according to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City.   Moreover, real estate agents in the Boston and Cleveland Districts were   uncertain about the future of home sales once the tax credit expires.   Availability of financing continued to be a concern for potential buyers in the   Cleveland and Chicago Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction activity remained weak in most Districts. Atlanta   reported that construction remained very low, and Cleveland expected new home   construction to proceed at a slow pace. Chicago indicated that construction on   existing developments edged up, but St. Louis reported that construction   activity declined. Kansas City reported that housing starts stabilized, although   levels remained well below a year ago and were not expected to improve over the   next three months. Philadelphia noted that builders continued to offer increased   incentives to boost sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate continued to weaken across the 12 Districts, although   even this sector had scattered bright spots. Each District indicated that demand   for private commercial real estate was weak, with New York, Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all   characterizing activity as declining further since the last report. An inability   to obtain credit was often cited as a problem for businesses that wanted to   purchase or build space. High vacancy rates were noted as a key concern   especially for landlords who were not offering concessions. And, while   industrial real estate in the Richmond District was generally weak, renewed   interest by retailers to revisit postponed expansion plans was also noted.   Finally, public nonresidential construction activity funded by federal stimulus   projects was a source of strength in the Cleveland, Chicago, Minneapolis, and   Dallas Districts, but gains were often offset by state and local government   cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many Districts continued   to report weak or declining loan demand, and many noted further erosion of   credit quality. For example, demand was reported as stable or declining by New   York, St. Louis, and Kansas City. Cleveland noted that commercial and industrial   lending was soft and consumer lending was flat or reduced. In the Richmond   District, modest signs of improvement in consumer loans were cited from banks in   areas typically supported by the health care and education industries.   Philadelphia also reported a small gain in consumer lending. San Francisco said   that loan demand was "largely stable or perhaps rose slightly." A major   exception to the general pattern of weak or declining lending activity was in   residential real estate. Most Districts cited the federal government's   first-time homebuyer program as supporting residential lending activity.   However, Dallas reported that residential mortgage demand was disappointing, and   St. Louis mentioned a moderate decline in real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Credit quality continued to be a problem, and rising delinquencies were often   noted. For example, credit quality was described as stable or declining in the   Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts. Half of the contacts for   Kansas City expected loan quality to continue to erode over the next six months.   Cleveland stated that the quality of loan applicants had deteriorated somewhat,   mostly on the business side. Delinquencies were also widely reported to be up;   New York particularly noted rising delinquency rates among both consumer and   commercial mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions   were generally reported as weak or mixed across Districts, but a few encouraging   signs were noted. Employment activity was soft in the Kansas City District, and   hiring remained limited in the Boston District. While a slowdown in layoffs was   reported by Atlanta, no hiring was generally expected. Reports from Cleveland   were mixed, but indicated declining employment in commercial construction and   coal mining. Employment levels held steady in the Dallas District, with   scattered reports of layoffs. However, staffing firms there noted improvement in   contract and temporary employment. Minneapolis reported a weak labor market, but   some signs of improvement were noted among auto-related industries. A major New   York employment agency specializing in office workers reported renewed softening   in recent weeks, with only scattered hiring at financial institutions and   virtually no hiring in the legal and publishing industries. Richmond noted   reports from temporary employment agencies were evenly mixed between reports of   strengthening and weakening, but with increased optimism for the near term   expressed since the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage and price pressures were generally described as subdued across most   Districts. Wages were flat in the San Francisco District, but increased   moderately in the Minneapolis District. In the Boston District, business   services firms (mainly advertising and consulting) reported modest salary   increases, but a decline in bonuses left total compensation slightly reduced.   Wage pressures were characterized as "not significant" in the Chicago District   and "contained" in the Cleveland District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices followed a similar pattern to wages, with reports of little   significant pressure on either input or output prices, although moderate   increases were observed for materials prices. For example, prices movements were   characterized as generally subdued or little changed in the Philadelphia,   Atlanta, and Minneapolis Districts. Cleveland noted stable construction   materials prices, but added that the cost of steel had experienced an uptick.   Materials prices in general were reported to be up in the Kansas City District.   Boston said that selling prices of manufacturing goods were flat to slightly up,   but noted that product competition and consumer clout was leading to downward   pressures in some market segments. Retail price inflation slowed slightly in the   Richmond District, while retail prices were stable in the Philadelphia District   and edged down in the Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Assessments of   agricultural activity were mixed. Reports from Richmond and Minneapolis   indicated that favorable growing conditions allowed farmers to make steady   progress in harvesting summer crops and planting winter crops. In some parts of   the Minneapolis District, however, a persistent drought delayed harvesting. In   contrast, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas Districts all noted unusually   high amounts of rainfall. In the Atlanta District, floods damaged some of North   Georgia's nurseries, vegetable farms, and commercial vineyards, but benefited   Florida citrus growers. Similarly, widespread rains brought much-needed relief   to drought-stricken parts of the Dallas District, allowing many ranchers to   scale back costly supplemental feeding--but not in time to prevent severe losses   to livestock and crops. Chicago and St. Louis mentioned that wet weather had   slowed crop maturity and harvesting, while Chicago reported lower than expected   yields. Kansas City indicated that, despite some delayed harvests, farmers   expected above-average yields.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the energy industry remained weak. Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas,   and San Francisco reported increases in oil and gas inventories as demand   continued to weaken. Atlanta indicated that refining margins continued to   deteriorate, which led to delays in new projects. Cleveland noted that sharply   lower contract prices for coal prompted coal miners to continue their deep   cutbacks in production and to keep their capital spending on hold. Kansas City   mentioned that overall drilling activity improved slightly, but that rig counts   were still at historically low levels. Dallas remarked that rig counts rose in   September and early October, spurred by oil drilling. However, Dallas also   indicated that, despite the increase, excess capacity in the industry had   resulted in job losses and weak domestic pricing. Minneapolis reported that   activity in the energy and mining sectors increased slightly and noted that oil   and gas exploration inched up in late September.
