      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Many business contacts in the First District report improving economic   conditions. Firms in manufacturing, software and information technology, and   staffing services cite ongoing increases in demand, with manufacturers reporting   the most strength. Commercial real estate markets are improving modestly, retail   reports are mixed, and residential real estate markets remain weak. Both   retailers and manufacturers report input cost increases, which they are   generally passing along to customers. Labor markets, by contrast, are seeing   some net hiring, but wage increases remain subdued. Outlooks remain generally   optimistic, although cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retailers report mixed sales   results for the period from late March through mid May, with comparable   same-store sales ranging from low double-digit decreases to low single-digit   increases. A few contacted retailers mention decreases in demand, and all   express concern about the negative impact of rising fuel prices on their own   costs, especially shipping, and on consumers' shopping habits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels are mixed, with one retailer explaining inventory has been   temporarily increased due to global supply concerns, such as output disruptions   in Japan. Contacts note steep price increases for commodities, including cotton,   dairy, grains, meat, produce, and nuts; they are passing along price increases   where possible. Headcount changes are mixed, as some firms add people in line   with new store openings and select hiring opportunities, while one has cut jobs   and anticipates outsourcing select positions. Capital spending is mixed.   Outlooks range from concerned to cautiously optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business conditions   continue to be good at surveyed manufacturers. A parts manufacturer for autos   and other vehicles reports that it is struggling to keep up with increased   demand. A firm in the semiconductor industry also cites very strong sales growth   in the first quarter of this year continuing into the second quarter. Reports   from local pharmaceutical manufacturers are also favorable, especially compared   with the end of last year, and a company in the medical devices business notes   improving sales of its traditional product line after a lengthy period of very   sluggish growth. Overall, contacted manufacturers are cautiously optimistic that   growth will continue at a reasonable pace for the rest of the second quarter and   into the second half of the year. Some firms, however, expect sales growth to   moderate somewhat, in part because the second half of 2010 was strong for many   respondents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commodity prices continue to be a concern for manufacturers whose production   inputs include petroleum or gas-related products and/or firms that use a lot of   metals such as steel. Most of the affected companies have already raised prices   with little push-back from their customers, and a number of them plan to   implement further price hikes this summer. By contrast, a pharmaceutical company   with overseas sales notes downward pressure on their selling prices to   government health care systems in Europe, which they attribute to ongoing fiscal   imbalances across the Euro-area and related interventions to reduce costs and   government debt. Some firms still report modest supply chain disruptions because   of the earthquake in Japan (mostly semiconductor-related and other high tech   inputs) or worldwide demand-related shortages of selected petroleum-related   products. However, one affected firm notes that supply conditions have improved   slightly recently and others say they continue to make adjustments to avoid a   big impact on their production or sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employment situation at surveyed manufacturers continues to be relatively   stable, as many continue to try to increase output using existing workers. A   semiconductor firm notes that the cost of this year's merit raises will be   offset through other productivity gains, so the overall cost impact is   negligible. Those firms that are hiring are doing so at a relatively moderate   rate to meet increased demand for existing or new products. In particular, some   pharmaceutical companies plan to meet increased demand by increasing their   headcounts between 5 percent and 10 percent. Much of the hiring and investment   at contacted firms is occurring overseas as they look to expand their   operations, especially in Asia. Most respondents have already or plan to   institute merit increases for their employees in 2011, ranging between 2 percent   and 5 percent, which they note are a little lower than before the recent   recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending at most contacted manufacturers continues to be in line with   previous years. A few companies, however, are investing more in order to adjust   their capacity to meet increased demand. Overall, the outlook for the contacted   firms is favorable and most respondents seem somewhat more upbeat than at the   beginning of this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Software and Information Technology Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England   software and information technology firms report modest increases in activity   through May. Year-over-year revenue increases, ranging from 4 percent to 20   percent, were generally driven by increases in software license revenues, while   maintenance contracts grew at a slower rate. Contacts report pick-ups in demand   across sectors, including manufacturing, financial, and medical. Increased   activity has led to increasing headcounts, many by more than 5 percent from a   year ago. Contacts generally cite a tightening labor market, especially for   specialized technical positions, but note that it has not resulted in upward   pressure on wages. Selling prices are holding steady, although half of   responding firms observe less discounting pressure currently than in Q4 2010; in   fact, two contacts plan to raise prices modestly later this year. Capital and   technology spending is mostly steady, with only two contacts reporting an   increase in outlays. The outlook among software and IT services firms remains   positive, with most expecting their current rate of growth to continue through   the end of 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Staffing Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of New England staffing   contacts report that business conditions continue to improve, although a few   have experienced stagnant or volatile activity over the past three months.   Revenues are flat to increasing year-over-year, with increases from 3 percent to   35 percent. Labor demand continues to strengthen, with notable improvements in   the information technology, medical, manufacturing, and legal sectors. However,   a few contacts lament an elongated hiring cycle, with employers "still waiting   for the perfect candidate." Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent   hiring continues to trend upwards-a sign that "things are heading in the right   direction." Labor supply, at least at the high end, continues to be tight in the   region. Bill rates and pay rates are steady, with most contacts reporting only   modest changes. Looking forward, most New England staffing contacts are more   positive than they were three and six months ago, predicting strong growth in   the rest of 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Across the region, contacts report   that commercial leasing activity remains modest, especially in the office sector   where job growth has been tepid. The Hartford office market shows very light   leasing activity and negligible absorption. In Providence, office leasing volume   was also very light, but rents are said to be firming up. Office leasing   activity in Boston is described as slow-to-moderate, and some say recent   activity is slower than in the first quarter. Boston deals consist largely of   tenant renewals, resulting in little net absorption. The biotechnology and   pharmaceuticals sector in Boston is seen as comparatively dynamic, generating   strong demand for office space in Cambridge and planned new construction in   Boston's waterfront area. In Portland, activity is flat for the most part,   although at least one significant office leasing deal was signed. Investor   interest in apartments remains strong in Boston, with some contacts expressing   concern that sales prices are getting too high; interest in prime office   properties also strengthened in Boston. The lending environment for commercial   real estate is described as increasingly favorable to borrowers. The outlook   among contacts is cautiously optimistic. All expect at least slow growth in   office and retail demand for the remainder of 2011 and some see potential for   significant improvement in market conditions by early 2012, although a few   mention risks posed by fiscal conditions and related political uncertainty at   both the state and national levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets   throughout New England experienced significant declines in sales and median   prices in April compared to a year earlier. Contacts attribute the sales   declines to the homebuyer tax credit, which boosted sales for the first half of   last year. Condominium sales fell during the same period, and the median price   of condos slipped across much of the region. Most contacts see job security as a   significant hurdle in the recovery of the residential real estate market.   Several contacts also note that stricter lending requirements among large banks   have shrunk the potential pool of homebuyers. In general, contacts report that   potential buyers are anticipating further price declines and sellers continue to   price homes competitively in order to find a buyer quickly. While overall market   activity remains weak, respondents see some improvement in the medium to   high-end segments of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts throughout the region expect year-over-year declines to continue for   the next few months because of last year's homebuyer tax credit. Although   several contacts believe that much of the New England real estate market has   begun stabilizing, they caution that a lengthy recovery still remains.
