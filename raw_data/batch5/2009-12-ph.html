      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District have been mixed in recent weeks.   Manufacturers, on balance, reported an increase in shipments and a steady rate   of new orders. Retailers indicated that sales have been rising slowly, although   they remained below the year-ago level for most stores. Motor vehicle dealers   indicated that sales have improved somewhat, although dealer closings continued.   Third District banks generally reported decreasing loan volume outstanding and   further declines in credit quality. Residential real estate agents and home   builders noted mostly unchanged sales rates. Nonresidential real estate leasing   and construction activity continued to decline. Service-sector firms generally   reported that activity continued to be slow. Business firms in the region   reported mostly level prices, although some indicated that prices of some basic   commodities have increased recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the Third District   business community remained lackluster in November. Manufacturers forecast a   rise in shipments and orders during the next six months, on balance, although   the balance of positive views has eased in the past month. Retailers have mixed   views, but on balance they expect sales for the holiday shopping period this   year to roughly match last year. Auto dealers expect sales to improve in the   near-term, although they say the number of dealers remaining in business will   continue to decline. Bankers anticipate demand for credit to remain weak though   the winter. Residential real estate contacts believe housing demand will   continue to firm up, but they do not expect a substantial increase in sales   until sometime next year. Contacts in nonresidential real estate expect leasing   and construction to remain weak well into 2010. Service-sector firms expect   activity to remain near current levels in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported   increases in shipments and new orders, on balance, from October to November,   although results varied across the major manufacturing sectors in the region.   Increased demand for their products was noted by makers of food products,   apparel, furniture, chemicals, and electrical equipment. Declining demand was   noted by makers of lumber and wood products, metal and metals products, and   industrial materials. Several firms said that the recent increases in business   been slight and that the pace of activity remained slow. As one firm noted,   "activity is still down compared with last year," and another said "even with   the slight uptick, activity is still down from the previous high."
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance. Among the firms polled in November, about half   expect new orders and shipments to increase during the next six months; about   one-tenth expect decreases. Although the balance of opinion among area   manufacturers remains positive, it is slightly less optimistic than it was   earlier in the fall. Nevertheless, the number of manufacturing firms planning to   increase capital spending plans has risen slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers reported slight increases   in sales during October and early November compared with September, although   most indicated that sales remained below the year-ago pace. Retailers said   consumers appear somewhat more willing to spend, although comments such as "the   consumer is focused on basics' and "consumers want good value' were common among   area merchants. Although sales have improved for several lines of merchandise,   retailers noted sales of big-ticket home goods remained weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Third District retailers have cautious views of year-end holiday   shopping period. Forecasts vary from slight year-over-year increases to small   year-over-year declines. Retailers, including those expecting gains, have   limited their inventories of merchandise for the holiday period, and many have   shifted their merchandise mix to lower-priced items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto   dealers reported some improvement in sales from September through early   November. Dealers said the sales increase, although slight, was widespread   across vehicle types. Nevertheless, closings of dealerships continued throughout   the region, and more are expected. Looking ahead, dealers foresee continued   improvement in sales for those who remain in business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding loan volume at Third District   banks has dipped in recent weeks, according to bankers contacted for this   report. Bankers said consumer lending and residential mortgage lending has   declined as result of both tighter credit standards and softer loan demand. Many   indicated, however, that the drop in commercial lending was mostly due to a   decline in demand. One banker said "we're calling on prospects but we're not   getting new business' and another said "new loans are not enough to offset   pay-downs and pay-offs.' However, despite the efforts to expand business   lending, both bankers and business firms noted that there has been a pullback in   lending to retailers generally and to firms in some service sectors. Most of the   banks contacted for this report said that credit quality continued to   deteriorate for all categories of lending, although several indicated that the   increase in delinquencies and charge-offs has slowed. Bankers generally expect   demand for credit to remain weak over the winter, but some expect a gradual   increase in demand to gain strength by the middle of next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of new and existing   homes were roughly steady in most parts of the Third District from September   into November, according to local real estate agents. They generally indicated   that sales of lower-price homes were moving up slightly but sales of   higher-price homes continued to be slow. Overall sales remained well below the   year-ago level. Selling prices of existing homes continued to move down,   although some real estate agents said the decline appeared to be easing.   Builders continued to offer incentives on new homes. Looking ahead, real estate   agents expect steady or only modestly strengthening home sales. One agent   remarked, "just because we've hit the bottom doesn't mean it's starting to get   better."
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that leasing and purchase activity   has continued to decline and that vacancy rates remain on the rise. Effective   rents have been falling significantly, prompting some relocations and lease   renegotiations by tenants, but no increases in occupied space. Contacts expect   nonresidential real estate markets to remain weak well into next year. One   contact said, "markets will remain under stress and uncertainty."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service-sector firms generally reported that   activity has remained slow since the last Beige Book. Among the region's   business services firms contacted for this report, nearly all indicated that   demand for their services has been flat in the past few weeks, although a few   said they have had slight gains recently. The region's service-sector firms see   no signs that business will pick up significantly in the near future. As one   contact said, "Our clients are showing no inclination to increase   spending."
     </p>
     <strong>
      Prices
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Reports on input costs and output   prices have been mixed since the last Beige Book. Manufacturing firms noted some   increases for the commodities they use but mainly steady prices of the products   they make. However, some makers of food products and chemicals have raised   prices. Retailers have generally kept their selling prices steady, and several   noted that they were realigning product mixes to emphasize lower-priced   merchandise.
