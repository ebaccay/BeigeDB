      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports  from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggest that national economic  conditions deteriorated further during the reporting period of January through  late February.  Ten of the twelve reports  indicated weaker conditions or declines in economic activity; the exceptions  were Philadelphia  and Chicago,  which reported that their regional economies "remained weak."  The deterioration was broad based, with only  a few sectors such as basic food production and pharmaceuticals appearing to be  exceptions.  Looking ahead, contacts from  various Districts rate the prospects for near-term improvement in economic  conditions as poor, with a significant pickup not expected before late 2009 or  early 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending remained sluggish on  net, although many Districts noted some improvement in January and February  compared with a dismal holiday spending season.   Travel and tourist activity fell noticeably in key destinations, as did  activity for a wide range of nonfinancial services, with substantial job cuts  noted in many instances.  Reports on  manufacturing activity suggested steep declines in activity in some sectors and  pronounced declines overall.  Conditions  weakened somewhat for agricultural producers and substantially for extractors  of natural resources, with reduced global demand cited as an underlying  determinant in both cases.  Markets for  residential real estate remained largely stagnant, with only minimal and  scattered signs of stabilization emerging in some areas, while demand for  commercial real estate weakened significantly.  Reports from banks and other financial  institutions indicated further drops in business loan demand, a slight deterioration  in credit quality for businesses and households, and continued tight credit  availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward price pressures continued to  ease across a broad spectrum of final goods and services.  This was largely associated with lower prices  for energy and assorted raw materials compared with earlier periods, but also with  weak final demand more generally, which spurred price discounting for items  other than energy and food.  With rising layoffs  and hiring freezes, unemployment has risen in all areas, reducing or  eliminating upward wage pressures.  A  number of reports pointed to outright reductions in hourly compensation costs,  through wage reductions and reduction or elimination of some employment  benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending remained very weak  on balance, albeit with slight firming noted by many Districts, particularly compared  with holiday-season sales that were very disappointing.  About half of the Districts reported that  consumer demand was softer than during recent reporting periods or fell  significantly below levels twelve months earlier.  However, compared with the preceding  reporting period that included the holiday season, retail spending was  described as "mixed" in the Boston and Richmond Districts, "nearly steady" in  Philadelphia, and slightly improved in Cleveland and Dallas, while New York  reported a reduced rate of decline compared with the "steep" pace in December.  But San    Francisco characterized retail sales as "anemic" and  pointed to double-digit sales declines relative to twelve months earlier for  many retail outlets.  As reported by Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco, discount  chains fared much better than traditional department stores and specialized  retailers, recording sales gains in many cases as consumers continued to switch  away from discretionary spending and luxury items and toward basic necessities.
     </p>
     <p>
      The weakness in discretionary spending was also reflected in  relative sales by product type.  Sales of  luxury goods such as jewelry, electronic equipment, and other big ticket items  were reported to be especially slow in the Philadelphia, Richmond, and Chicago Districts.  Demand for furniture, appliances, and other  durable household items remained quite depressed, according to Kansas City and San Francisco.  Sales of new automobiles and light trucks  remained exceptionally sluggish, with Philadelphia,  Richmond, and Kansas City reporting  further declines from an already slow pace of sales.  Used vehicles fared better in general, with Kansas City and San Francisco noting that  they were selling well and Cleveland  and Chicago  reporting improvement over the previous period.   Reports of gains in retail spending were largely limited to grocery  stores and pharmacies, although reports from Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Richmond indicated some pickup in sales of  apparel, which the latter District attributed in part to severe winter weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Travel and tourist activity  continued to fall in most areas, as households reduced their vacation travel  and corporate travel spending was scaled back.   Tourist visits and spending were reported to be slower than in the  previous reporting period or down from twelve months earlier for major tourist  destinations in the Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, New York, and San Francisco  Districts, with the declines in the latter two characterized as "substantial"  and "sharp," respectively.  Airline  traffic fell in the Kansas City,  Dallas, and San  Francisco Districts.  Business at restaurants  dropped substantially in some areas, notably in the Kansas City and San Francisco Districts, with  extensive layoffs and restaurant closures reported in the latter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on nonfinancial services  indicated significant drops in activity accompanied by widespread job cuts.  Providers of health-care services reported  falling patient volumes, which were attributed in part to a drop in elective  procedures in the Richmond,  Minneapolis, and  San Francisco Districts.  Demand  continued to fall for professional services such as business consulting and  accounting services, legal services, and other professional services in various  Districts.  However, Dallas noted a modest increase, albeit less-than-expected,  in demand for legal services due to increased bankruptcy proceedings.  Providers of information technology (IT)  services in the Boston District saw a drop in activity on average, although  some firms have sustained strong revenue growth; activity among providers of IT  services was reported as stable to up in Kansas City, and Minneapolis reported  that some IT services firms have seen solid demand from companies that are  intent on using the technology to reduce costs.   Demand for staffing services weakened  considerably.  Boston reported that outcomes for providers  of temporary staffing services were "dismal," with revenue declines in the  range of 20 to 50 percent compared with twelve months earlier.  Chicago and Dallas also reported sizable  declines in activity by staffing firms, and New York noted that activity by a major  employment agency has "virtually ground to a halt."
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for shipping and transportation  services fell further.  New York, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta reported reduced activity and layoffs  among trucking and rail companies, with the decline in activity described as  considerable in some cases.  Richmond  also reported that shipping activity through ports in that District slowed further,  as imports and exports both continued on a downward trend.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity fell on net  in all Districts, with very sharp declines recorded for some sectors and only partial  offsets provided by the few bright spots.   Cleveland  reported a drop in overall factory output of about 25 percent compared with twelve  months earlier.  For most Districts, the  drop in activity was especially pronounced for makers of capital goods and construction-related  equipment and materials, such as primary metals, wood products, and electrical  equipment, along with consumer durables such as autos and furniture.  Manufacturers of computers, semiconductors,  and other IT products saw further declines in production and orders in the Dallas and San Francisco  Districts.  Slower export sales were cited  as a source of weakness for various manufacturing sectors by the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing of biotechnology products and pharmaceuticals was one  bright spot, with Boston  reporting sales gains at a double-digit pace for biopharmaceutical firms, Richmond noting continued  hiring of temporary staff among life sciences and pharmaceutical companies, and  Chicago  reporting continued strong demand for pharmaceuticals.  Aircraft manufacturers in the St. Louis  District are planning to expand existing production facilities; activity in  this sector was largely stable in the Cleveland  and San Francisco Districts, but contacts expect some slowing in the future as  airlines reduce capacity due to a slowdown in air travel.  Food processors and manufacturers of selected  chemicals also saw further increases in demand during the reporting period, according  to Philadelphia  and San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      As a result of declining production,  capacity utilization fell in most manufacturing sectors, with rates as low as 25  to 50 percent reported for some metal fabricators.  Several Districts reported that capital  spending plans were curtailed further during the reporting period, notably for  companies in the retail sector and within manufacturing, which suggests the  possibility of further reductions in orders for capital goods going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets remained  in the doldrums in most areas, with only scattered, very tentative signs of  stabilization reported.  The pace of  sales remained very low in most areas and declined further in some; most  Districts reported small declines, but New York cited a sales drop of 60 to 65  percent in Manhattan compared with twelve months earlier.  By contrast, Cleveland, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco each reported a rising or  better-than-expected sales pace for existing or new homes in some areas,  attributed largely to falling prices and improved financing terms for some  types of home mortgages.  House prices  continued to decline, reportedly at double-digit paces in some areas, with  little or no signs of a deceleration evident.   Builders in various Districts generally remain pessimistic regarding  recovery prospects this year, and consequently the pace of new home  construction declined further in most areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for commercial, industrial,  and retail space fell further during the reporting period, with some evidence  of more rapid deterioration than in preceding periods.  Vacancy rates rose and lease rates declined on  a widespread basis; New York noted that commercial real estate markets  "weakened noticeably," while Atlanta described reports on commercial real  estate that were "decidedly more negative" than in previous periods.  Construction activity has declined  commensurately, and assorted reports suggest that market participants expect  this weakness to continue at least through the end of 2009.  Cleveland  noted that public works projects have shown stability of late, although they  declined in the San Francisco District as a result of the budgetary struggles  of some state and local governments there.  Credit constraints and uncertainty were  reported to be a drag on commercial construction and leasing activity in the Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Lending activity fell further on  net, with mixed results across Districts and loan categories.  Demand for commercial and industrial loans  was reported to be lower in most Districts, although Philadelphia reported  recent growth in this category.  Consumer  loan demand also fell in general, although Cleveland reported that it was "stable to up"  during the reporting period.  Demand for  new mortgages remained depressed, but New    York, Cleveland,  and Richmond noted  that refinancing activity continued at high levels or increased further.  Boston  and Cleveland  reported that loan demand and the availability of funds were more favorable for  community banks than for institutions with a national scope.
     </p>
     <p>
      The availability of credit generally remained tight.  Lenders continued to impose strict standards  for all types of loans, with scattered reports of further tightening and  particular scrutiny focused on construction projects and commercial real estate  transactions.  Despite stringent  standards, Atlanta  and Chicago  noted that funds were available for well-qualified applicants, and Dallas cited contacts who  reported that capital has become more readily available.  Credit quality fell for all loan categories,  with declines cited by most Districts with the notable exception of Kansas  City, where current loan quality was unchanged and expectations for future  quality improved modestly.  New York reported that  the deterioration in quality was most pronounced for consumer loans, while Chicago emphasized  deterioration in the quality of business loans as a result of rising  bankruptcies.  Scattered reports  suggested improved liquidity in some credit markets and reductions in interest  spreads, with Chicago  noting that conditions for the commercial paper and corporate bond markets  "improved significantly."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conditions weakened for agricultural  producers in various Districts, as demand fell and growing conditions were  mixed.  Sales slowed for a variety of tree  and row crops, grains, dairy products, and livestock, and some product prices declined  significantly.  Dallas and Atlanta reported that sales were undermined  by a drop in overseas demand, and the latter District also faced a sharp  decline in demand for peanuts resulting from a recent salmonella outbreak at a  processing plant.  Planting and growing  conditions were mixed within and across Districts, with adequate moisture and favorable  temperatures reported for many areas but ongoing drought conditions and  restricted water supplies noted by Dallas  and San Francisco.  Producers benefited from declining input  prices on net, but these were not large enough to offset slower sales and lower  product prices, which put downward pressure on profit margins and land values,  according to Chicago  and Kansas City.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity slowed significantly for producers  of natural resource products.  Reduced  global demand and lower prices for oil have prompted a sharp cutback in oil  extraction activity since last fall, with Dallas  noting an "unprecedented" decline in the domestic rig count that was largely  concentrated in their District.   Respondents from the Kansas City District expect oil extraction activity  to fall further as the year proceeds, and Minneapolis  noted that natural gas and mining activities also faltered during the reporting  period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures were very  limited during the reporting period, as a result of lower energy and commodity  prices and weak demand for final goods and services across a wide range of  sectors.  The lower prices of energy and  raw materials generally were passed on and contributed to downward pressure on  the final prices of various products, according to Chicago and Dallas.  Prices dropped on selected retail items in  the Philadelphia, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, as  discounting was widespread.  Selected  food products were a notable exception to downward price pressures, with Philadelphia reporting  that some food processors raised their product prices.  Gas prices rose, but according to Chicago and San Francisco the  increase was not large enough to substantially offset the ongoing effects of the  net decline from last year's highs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures eased in all  Districts, as a rising incidence of hiring freezes and continued job cuts  increased the degree of labor market slack.   Contacts from various Districts pointed to a higher incidence of wage  freezes resulting from the added slack, with a few noting outright wage reductions.  Some employers also reduced compensation by lowering  benefit costs, including reduced contributions to employee retirement programs,  according to the Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco  Districts.
