      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 12, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy continued its moderate recovery since the last   report. Consumer spending, tourism, services, manufacturing, energy, mining and   agriculture saw increases. Commercial real estate showed a slight but surprising   increase in activity; commercial construction was flat, and residential   construction and real estate decreased. Labor markets continued to strengthen   modestly, and wage increases remained generally subdued. Overall price increases   were modest, but some exceptions were noted among inputs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending during   the holiday season increased from a year ago. Sales activity was favorable   during December compared with the prior year at a Minneapolis area mall. A North   Dakota mall manager reported that traffic was up about 3 percent to 5 percent in   December from the previous year. In South Dakota, a mall manager noted strong   retail activity during the last week before Christmas; some stores reported lean   inventory levels following unanticipated strong holiday sales volumes. Also in   South Dakota, a toy retailer reported strong holiday sales compared with a year   ago. A chamber of commerce representative in northern Wisconsin reported that   area retailers were pleased with the holiday shopping season. A Minnesota bank   director noted that holiday shopping began earlier this season.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to an auto dealers association in Minnesota, new vehicle sales   through November were up slightly from a year ago; light trucks gained market   share relative to cars. A Minnesota domestic auto dealer reported strong   December sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter tourism activity was up from a year ago. Sales of snowmobiles   increased at two dealerships in central Minnesota compared with the previous   year, as early snowfall blanketed the region. A representative of a Minnesota   ski resort reported that winter sports activity in the area was well ahead of   last season due to good snow conditions and a better outlook for the economy.   However, rain and warm temperatures at the end of December led to deteriorating   snow conditions for cross country skiing and snowmobiling in northwestern   Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, commercial   construction was flat at low levels. Commercial construction activity has   trended downward in Fargo, N.D., and Great Falls, Mont., according to sources   there. Commercial builders in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area described activity   as mostly stable, though some noted signs of slight increases. November   commercial and office permits increased in Sioux Falls, S.D., from a year   earlier. Overall residential construction decreased. The value of November   residential permits fell 7 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul from a year earlier,   though the number of permitted units increased. Home building permits in   November fell in value in Sioux Falls, but increased slightly in Fargo from the   previous year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate showed a slight but surprising increase in activity.   In Minneapolis-St. Paul, several large leasing deals were announced and a large   suburban office tower was recently sold. A November survey by the University of   St. Thomas found increased optimism among Minnesota commercial real estate   market participants. A commercial broker and developer in Fargo said activity   there has picked up as well, with a reduction in the amount of empty retail   space. Residential real estate markets slowed. A November survey of Ninth   District real estate agents showed decreases in sales prices and transactions   and increases in inventory and time on market. November closed sales in   Minneapolis-St. Paul fell 39 percent from a year earlier, and median sales   prices declined more than 2 percent. In contrast, a real estate agent in   Bismarck, N.D., described the market there as healthy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Professional business services firms reported   increased activity. A contact that supports business travel services noted an   unexpected increase in activity since the last report. A large technology   company is increasing the number of its contract programmers to support software   upgrades. An architectural firm noted an increase in projects up for bid as well   as a greater number of bidders. Firms that support the mortgage refinance market   noted a sharp decline in activity due to higher long-term interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. A December survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota and   North Dakota. A South Dakota maker of video display systems noted increased new   orders since the last report. A Minnesota equipment component producer noted   strong sales and was increasing production capacity. A bank director reported   that regional manufacturers were busier than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Late-December oil exploration activity   increased since mid-November. New wind-energy investments were announced since   the last report. Continued strong prices were noted for District mining   commodities, and District mines were operating at near capacity. A Montana mine   recently signed an agreement that will again supply palladium to a large   domestic automaker. In Minnesota, November iron ore production increased from   October and a mine plans to upgrade its facility to supply Mexican steel   plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Since the last report, agricultural output   prices strengthened, but large snowfalls hampered some ranchers. Prices for most   District agricultural commodities increased since the last report, including   corn, soybeans, wheat, steers and hogs. Snow cover was relatively modest in   Montana and South Dakota, but deep snow impeded ranchers in North Dakota and   Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to   strengthen modestly. According to an ad hoc poll of 104 contacts conducted in   early January, 39 percent expect to increase hiring and 11 percent expect to   decrease hiring over the next six to 12 months. A representative of a   Minnesota-based health care system noted that the pace of hiring health care   workers was picking up. A Montana job service office reported a relatively   sizable number of job openings posted, but demand for nonskilled workers   declined somewhat. A Minnesota iron ore pellet producer recently hired 50   workers and plans to hire 24 more to increase production levels. However, a   recreational vehicle manufacturer will lay off 500 workers this spring at a   plant in northwestern Wisconsin. In Minnesota, a trucking company recently   closed, laying off 210 drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases remained generally subdued. However, a Minnesota all-terrain   vehicle powertrain manufacturer gave out bonuses for the first time in several   years following the company's relatively strong performance during 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall price increases were modest, but some exceptions were noted among   inputs. Bank directors noted generally stable retail prices, but mentioned some   input price increases, such as copper and some steel products. Minnesota   gasoline prices at the end of December were about 20 cents per gallon higher   than a month earlier.
