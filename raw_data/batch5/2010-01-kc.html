      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded more modestly in late November and   December than in the previous survey period. Overall holiday consumer spending   was little changed from a year ago, but sales in some areas were hampered by   extremely bad year-end weather. Growth in manufacturing activity moderated from   the previous survey, and businesses' capital spending plans remained modest. The   rebound in residential real estate lost some steam, and commercial construction   activity weakened further. Bank loan demand remained sluggish, and overall loan   quality was poor. By contrast, energy activity continued to rise from low   levels, and agricultural conditions improved. Price pressures were limited, and   wage pressures remained low due to weakness in the labor market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending growth softened   somewhat from the previous survey. Overall, holiday retail sales were little   changed from a year ago. Some contacts reported slight increases from a year   ago, but extremely bad weather limited holiday sales in other areas. Store   managers generally reported stronger sales of discounted items and winter gear,   while sales of luxury items such as jewelry were relatively weak. Store   inventories were up slightly, but most contacts expected a decrease in the   months ahead. Restaurant traffic edged up marginally from the previous period,   and expectations were more positive. Auto sales dropped after steadying in the   previous survey, though most dealers expected some improvement in future months.   Auto inventories were still fairly high and expected to rise, and some contacts   noted continued difficulties obtaining customer financing. Travel and tourism   activity weakened further, with one contact noting considerably less business   travel. Nearly all tourism contacts expected a continued slowdown in   activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in   manufacturing activity moderated somewhat in late November and December, while   other business activity was mixed. Overall growth in factory production slowed,   while employment remained essentially flat. Plant managers also reported smaller   gains in shipments and new orders. Expectations for future factory activity were   slightly less optimistic than in previous surveys, but factory output was still   expected to rise moderately in the first half of 2010. Transportation services   activity slowed slightly in late November and December, but contacts expressed   more optimism about future months. High-tech services firms reported mostly   favorable business conditions and were generally positive about the months   ahead. Despite generally positive outlooks, businesses' capital spending   plans--especially among manufacturers--were fairly modest for 2010, as   considerable excess capacity remains. Still, some business spending was   occurring to replace outdated IT and other equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity eased somewhat after a rebound in the previous survey, and the downturn   in commercial real estate activity continued. Housing starts dampened slightly,   as several builders noted continued financing difficulties, but expectations   improved from the previous survey. Home sales also eased from the previous   survey, but levels were higher than a year ago and expectations strengthened due   to the renewed homebuyer tax credit. Sales were strongest in the low-end market,   with continued weak demand for higher-priced homes.Several real estate agents   reported sales were limited by tighter credit restrictions and appraisal   guidelines. Mortgage lenders reported that overall mortgage activity edged down   slightly from last month, with fewer home purchase and refinancing loans.   Commercial real estate activity continued to deteriorate across the District,   with few improvements expected in the near future. Vacancy rates continued to   rise, and prices and rents declined further. Construction supply firms reported   especially weak sales, which most contacts attributed to a slowdown in lending   and weak commercial construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported weaker loan demand, stable   deposits, and a continued negative outlook for loan quality. Overall loan demand   declined at a somewhat faster pace than in the previous two surveys. Demand fell   moderately for both commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate   loans. In addition, demand for residential real estate loans and consumer   installment loans edged down. A few banks tightened credit standards on   commercial real estate loans. As in the previous survey, however, credit   standards for other loan categories were little changed. When asked about the   cause of the continued weakness in bank lending, two-thirds of respondents cited   weak demand from creditworthy borrowers, and some banks mentioned pressure from   regulators. Almost all respondents reported lower loan quality than a year ago,   and about a third expected loan quality to decline further in the next six   months. Deposits were essentially unchanged, following several months of steady   growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity was up modestly from the previous   survey, but remained below year-ago levels. Most contacts reported an increase   in drilling activity and were optimistic about the months ahead, as crude oil   prices remained relatively high and natural gas prices finally turned upward.   With natural gas inventories still at historically high levels, however, some   producers worried that gas prices might fall if recent cold winter weather   across the country did not continue. Most energy firms expected their capital   expenditures to increase or remain unchanged over the next twelve months, with   very few planning decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions improved since the   last survey period. Farmers enjoyed above average corn and soybean yields,   especially in Nebraska and Kansas. Despite planting delays, the winter wheat   crop was progressing normally and was reported in good condition with ample snow   cover. The post-harvest rise in corn and soybean prices spurred strong marketing   opportunities and higher incomes for farmers. Livestock prices moved higher,   narrowing losses for producers. Cattle feeding enterprises were operating at   breakeven levels, but dairy and hog operations still faced significant losses.   District contacts reported that farmland values firmed in the fourth quarter   amid robust demand for good quality farmland and a limited number of farms for   sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures were modest, and wage   pressures remained limited due to weak labor markets. Manufacturers reported   mostly stable prices, but some noted lower profit margins due to rising   commodity prices and little ability to pass through. Overall retail prices   continued their downward trend, and most contacts expected prices to fall   further in coming months. However, builders and transportation firms reported a   slight uptick in input prices. Almost no firms reported labor shortages,   resulting in little if any wage pressures. Hiring plans at many firms also   remained minimal, which some firms attributed to uncertainty surrounding future   employee health care costs.
