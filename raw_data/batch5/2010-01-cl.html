      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District has shown some signs of improvement since   our last report, although overall activity remains at a low level. Reports from   manufacturers indicated that production was stable or slightly up, with several   citing growth opportunities in off-shore markets. Little change was seen in   new-home construction, whereas non-residential builders reported a small   increase in contract awards. Financing remains a major issue for residential and   commercial contractors. Sales by District retailers and auto dealers were flat.   Energy production held steady, and reports showed a slight upturn in freight   transport volume. Business and consumer lending activity remains soft, while the   growth rate in core deposits is starting to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      The labor market remains weak, but some business owners started recalling a   few workers or increased production hours. Staffing-firm representatives   reported an increased number of job openings, especially in the healthcare   industry. Given the weak labor market, wage pressures are contained. We heard   many reports of rising prices for metals, especially steel. Otherwise, raw   material and product pricing were relatively stable. Capital spending and   inventories remain under tight control.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District factories showed that   production was largely stable or slightly up during the past six weeks, with any   reductions being attributed to seasonal factors. Comparing on a year-over-year   basis, most of our contacts told us that production levels have not changed or   have showed a moderate rise. Manufacturers are more upbeat in their outlook   since our last report, and many expect volume to slowly increase during 2010,   with several citing opportunities in export markets. Steel shipments were in   line with expectations or exceeded them, although volume reports varied widely.   Increased volume was attributed primarily to military spending and other   government-funded projects. Our steel contacts expect slow growth and are   uncertain about which industries will drive demand. District auto production   showed a modest decline during November on a month-over-month and year-over-year   basis for domestic and foreign nameplates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers reported that they have completed rebalancing their   inventories. Capacity utilization is holding steady, but at rates substantially   below pre-recession levels. Investment in capital projects remains weak, with   spending expected to continue on the low side during 2010. We heard many reports   of a rise in metal prices (especially steel). Steel increases were attributed to   rising scrap costs, which prompted steel producers and service centers to raise   their own prices. Otherwise, the cost of raw materials was generally stable.   About half of our respondents said that they have increased work hours or   recalled a few production employees, and wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicate little change in new-home   construction during the past six weeks, while sales on a year-over-year basis   are slightly better. Purchases of entry-level homes continue to do well, and a   few builders reported a recovery in the move-up category. Looking forward, about   half of our contacts characterized themselves as cautiously optimistic. Other   contractors see little improvement, which they attributed in part to downward   pressure on prices resulting from a new wave of foreclosures. Home builders   reported that banks are unwilling to lend money for purchasing land or   constructing spec houses, resulting in a substantial depletion of inventories.   List prices of new homes remained stable or were reduced slightly during the   past few months, while construction material costs held steady. General   contractors continue to operate with skeleton crews, and many subcontractors are   struggling to keep busy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on activity in non-residential construction, including public works,   were mixed. Although most of our contacts said that business has fallen on a   year-over-year basis and many have nearly depleted their backlogs, inquiries   have improved and we heard several reports of contract awards. A majority of   contractors now expect at least a slight improvement in activity during 2010. We   continue to hear numerous accounts of difficulties in obtaining financing and   refinancing. Construction material prices were stable. Half of our respondents   reported that they have reduced their workforces since our last report. Many   subcontractors are struggling and are charging substantially lower rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retailers characterized   sales for the period from mid-November to mid-December as flat, when compared to   the previous 30-day period. The exception was a restaurant chain, which showed a   moderate increase in revenues. Results of a year-over-year sales comparison   tended toward the down side. Although holiday shopping gave a modest boost to   the purchase of discretionary items, consumers continue to focus on buying   necessities and are looking for value-priced substitutes. Several of our   contacts are uncertain about future sales. Others expect sales for the first   quarter of 2010 to remain flat or to rise slightly at best. Vendor pricing has   been relatively stable, although we heard some reports of rollbacks in store   prices for basics. A few contacts told us that they are making less use of   promotions and markdowns. Retail inventories continued on the lean side. Auto   dealers reported that new-vehicle sales have flattened out at a low level since   the cash-for-clunkers program ended. On a year-over-year comparison, most   vehicle sales figures showed no change or were slightly up. Used-vehicle   purchases were characterized as good, if not better, than those for   new-vehicles, resulting in some upward pressure on prices. Dealers were evenly   split in their expectations of future sales: flat in the first quarter of 2010   versus a modest increase. Several dealers cited lean inventories and   difficulties in obtaining floor-plan financing as reasons for low sales. There   has been little change in staffing levels other than seasonal hiring by   retailers and job losses at dealerships that closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for business loans remains weak, and lines   of credit are underutilized. Bankers experiencing increased lending volume   attributed it to refinancing existing debt from other institutions. Interest   rates and spreads were steady to slightly up. On the consumer side, conventional   loan demand was generally characterized as weak to steady at best, while   activity in the residential mortgage market slowed further due to seasonal   factors. On balance, core deposits continued to grow, although a few bankers   said that the rate of growth has tapered off. Interest margins are steady to   slightly up. Credit availability remains tight, with some additional incremental   tightening of lending standards, especially for commercial real estate loans. In   general, the credit quality of loan applicants remains weak or has deteriorated   further. Consumer loan delinquencies are relatively stable, while delinquencies   among commercial borrowers (especially real estate) remain elevated or are   rising. Most banks have not changed the size of their workforces. However, three   of our contacts said that they are in a long-term process to reduce employment   as a result of restructurings and mergers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Little change in oil and gas production was   reported, although it is expected to increase slightly due to seasonal factors.   Spot prices for oil are stable within a narrow range, while those for natural   gas were up a little. Coal executives told us that the sharp decline in output   has flattened out, with no upturn expected during the next few months. The cost   of production equipment and materials remains stable. Capital spending by oil   and gas producers was on plan or a little higher than expected, whereas   investments in coal production remain at depressed levels. Oil and gas   employment held steady, while coal saw some additional workforce reductions.   Wage pressures are contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport executives reported a   slight improvement in shipping volume since our last report. However, shipments   are below year-ago levels and margins remain depressed. Most of our contacts   expressed uncertainty about near-term activity and expect only modest   improvements in volume during 2010. A few executives attributed potential   changes in federal government regulations and policies as the driving force   behind the uncertainty. Capital spending remains at low levels, although some   pickup is anticipated during the next six months. Hiring was limited to   replacement only.
