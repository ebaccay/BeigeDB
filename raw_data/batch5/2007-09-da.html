      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in the    Eleventh District continued to decelerate in July and August, but respondents    with national operations said the District economy remained stronger than    much of the rest of the country. Tighter credit standards curtailed some    residential construction, which caused home building to decelerate at a    slightly faster pace. The level of nonresidential construction is still high,    but tighter credit standards have restrained some commercial investment.    Manufacturing activity picked up slightly in recent weeks. Demand for    business services was mixed, but overall activity was similar to the last    report. Retail sales continued at roughly the same pace, but auto sales were    softer. Energy activity remains robust, and agricultural conditions were    mostly positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts within the lending and real    estate communities are highly focused on recent changes in the perception of    credit risk and most have taken steps to cut costs and/or reduce employment.    A few companies reported serious financial stress. Others remain optimistic    that, while the cost of funds has increased for some borrowers, markets will    settle within 60 to 90 days leaving little long-lasting effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside the lending and real estate    communities, contacts are much less focused on or concerned about recent    changes in credit markets. A few expressed relief that the adjustment has    finally occurred and conditions are not worse. While cautious, many firms    reported seeing no impact so far for their customers or their company.    Retailers who lend to customers said they have experienced an increase in    delinquencies that has led them to become more careful scrutinizing the    credit worthiness of customers. A few are looking forward to lower costs for    commercial real estate. While many business leaders expressed increased    nervousness about the outlook, most were optimistic that there would be no    material impact on their firm and had not changed their business plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Energy costs remained high, and fuel    surcharges are commonplace. Strong demand for corn for ethanol has resulted    in higher costs for many food items, and contacts say these costs are being    passed to selling prices. Strong demand led to price increases for most    chemicals, and increased feedstock costs pushed up plastic prices. Declines    in the value of the dollar have raised import costs for several industries.    High input costs are resulting in double-digit price increases for paper    products. High-tech manufacturers report upward pressure on some prices, such    as flash memory and flat panel glass. Airfares are higher.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is downward pressure on real estate prices.    Upward price pressures have abated for many construction-related products;    steel prices are steady at high levels, and prices have fallen for lumber,    aluminum and copper. Retailers say discounts are pushing down selling prices.    Auto dealers have increased incentives for both domestic and imported models.    High-tech firms say overcapacity is pushing down DRAM    prices. Natural gas prices have fallen, and the energy industry reported less    upward price pressure for some items used in drilling. Wholesale gasoline    prices fell as growing capacity utilization by refineries pushed domestic    inventories back up to the bottom of the normal range for this time of    year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The labor market remained tight,    particularly for skilled workers. Wages are rising substantially for some    positions, such as lawyers. The current adjustment in homebuilding and    financial services had led to layoffs and hiring freezes in those industries.    A few contacts said workers with financial experience are in hot demand, and    some who have lost their jobs are being actively solicited by other firms. A    number of industries continued to report difficulty finding workers. Some    firms expressed concern that the already tight labor market will tighten    further because of stricter enforcement of immigration laws, including the    recently implemented no-match program that requires closer scrutiny of some    workers' social security numbers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Factory production continued to slow    for products supplying residential construction, such as brick, lumber,    cement and primary metals. Most producers expect further deterioration in    sales, except in the lumber industry where contacts believe the current slow    level will persist but not worsen. Demand remained solid to supply products    related to nonresidential construction, such as for schools, infrastructure    and commercial projects. Fabricated metals producers reported a pickup in    activity, as crews returned to work following rain disruptions earlier this    summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for paper products was mixed. Firms supplying    cleaning supplies and other paper products to offices reported strong    increases in demand and an optimistic outlook. Sales of corrugated boxes to    manufacturers continued to soften, and the outlook was more uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of high tech products said    sales and orders continued to grow at about the same or a slightly faster    pace. Equipment manufacturers reported a slow down in orders that they expect    will continue through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Food producers said demand was solid,    although contacts are wary about a possible slowdown as price increases are    passed to consumers. Factories producing transportation parts and vehicles    reported continued solid or strong activity, with the exception of    automobiles, where weaker demand led at least one factory to reduce    production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Refineries moved back over 90 percent    utilization rates. Petrochemical sales were strong, boosted by a weak dollar    and buoyant global demand. Sales of most plastics have been climbing steadily    for most of this year. Weakness in the housing market has hurt sales of PVC    pipe and siding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary staffing firms said demand improved slightly, with a pickup for    call centers, manufacturing and energy. Orders were strong for workers with    accounting and IT skills, mixed for financial services and soft for    construction. Accounting activity was steady and strong--up a bit from last year. Demand    in the energy, audit and tax sectors was solid. Law firms say activity is    unchanged and slightly below last year. One contact said "credit issues"    dampened transactional work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rail, small parcel, and intermodal    transportation firms reported small decreases in cargo volume over the past    month. Airlines say loads and bookings are stronger than expected, and there    is no sign that consumer or business travelers are slowing down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retailers reported little change in the    growth of consumer spending in July and August but noted that a number of    factors are making it difficult to interpret trends, including a shift in the    start of back-to-school and stocking up that occurred in anticipation of a    hurricane. Sales continued to be below the level of a year ago but were    stronger than in the country as a whole. Purchasing patterns and payment    histories suggest customers are under more financial stress than earlier this    summer. Most firms have become more nervous about the outlook but have not changed    their plans. Automobile sales have been soft over the past six weeks--down    significantly from a year ago for both car and service sales. Contacts    expressed nervousness because, they say, the automotive market tends to    follow the mortgage market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential real estate markets showed    more signs of weakness in July and August. Home sales continued to soften due    to lower demand, tighter credit standards and buyers having difficulty    selling their current houses. New home cancellations are still high. Contacts    said credit standards were tightened for lower-priced homes two to three    months ago, and now buyers of homes above $500,000 are having problems    obtaining financing. Inventories are rising, leading a few respondents to express    concern about potential weakness in home prices. The outlook is mixed; many    contacts expect the lending adjustment to be short-lived, resulting in a    sales rebound in 2008. Others-- particularly builders--are more pessimistic,    projecting a rebound in 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing activity remained slower    than last year, but market fundamentals are relatively good, with positive    absorption and rising rents. Developers say financing terms are changing    mid-deal, with lenders appearing unsure of how to price loans. According to    some respondents, there are fewer investors seeking property, and some    investment and/or development deals have been canceled. Contacts are nervous    but think the situation will correct itself soon. However, they fear investor    confidence will erode if problems continue into September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Banks and credit unions reported a pick up in    deposit growth and good credit quality. Consumer lending softened earlier    this year and further deterioration is not expected. The financial services industry has become    more cautious about lending and has tightened credit standards while they're    evaluating risk management. Uncertainty about how to measure and assess risk    has led to changes in the structure, leverage and pricing of loans. Contacts    expect these changes to continue over the next several    weeks until the market stabilizes. With the exception of homebuilders, they    say their clients' businesses look good and economic fundamentals remained    strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Energy activity remained robust. Domestic    drilling has flattened out in recent months, causing a sharp slowdown in    demand for durable equipment, such as drill pipe and rigs. Day rates for land    rigs are flat to down slightly. Demand is still strong for services delivered    at the wellhead or for machinery and supplies consumed during the drilling    process. Pricing remained very profitable, but the flat market has seen some    "some push-back" by producers and "sharper negotiations." International    drilling is growing and remained the primary source of strength for service    companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts expressed concern that the    growing inventory of natural gas may push prices down to levels that will    restrain some activity. Unconventional natural gas has been an important    element of the current level of drilling, and high natural gas prices are    required to justify this drilling. There are no signs of a slowdown so far,    and pressure pumping--a service closely associated with unconventional    drilling--was described as improving in demand and pricing in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Soil moisture was adequate in most    areas, boosting pasture growth and livestock conditions. Cotton acreage was    maturing well, and harvest was in full swing in several parts of the    District. Strong summer rains temporarily halted field activities and    deteriorated crop conditions in some areas. The grain sorghum crop took the    brunt of wet weather, resulting in both yield and quality losses.
