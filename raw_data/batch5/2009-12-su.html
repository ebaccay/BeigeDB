      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2,  2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and based   on information collected on or before November 20, 2009. This document   summarizes comments received from businesses and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic   conditions have generally improved modestly since the last report. Eight   Districts indicated some pickup in activity or improvement in conditions, while   the remaining four--Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, and Atlanta--reported   that conditions were little changed and/or mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending was reported to have picked up moderately since the last   report, for both general merchandise and vehicles; a number of Districts noted   relatively robust sales of used autos. Most Districts indicated that non-auto   retailers were holding lean inventories going into the holiday season. Tourism   activity varied across Districts. Manufacturing conditions were said to be, on   balance, steady to moderately improving across most of the country, while   conditions in the nonfinancial service sector generally strengthened somewhat,   though with some variation across Districts and across industries. Residential   real estate conditions were somewhat improved from very low levels, on balance,   led by the lower end of the market. Most Districts reported some pickup in home   sales, though prices were generally said to be flat or declining modestly;   residential construction was characterized as weak, but some Districts did note   some pickup in activity. Commercial real estate markets and construction   activity were depicted as very weak and, in many cases, deteriorating.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial institutions generally reported steady to weaker loan demand,   continued tight credit standards, and steady or deteriorating loan quality. In   the agricultural sector, the fall harvest was delayed in the eastern half of the   nation due to excessively wet conditions during October and early November. Most   energy-producing Districts noted a slight uptick in activity in the sector since   the last report. Labor market conditions remained weak since the last report,   though there were signs of stabilization and scattered signs of improvement.   While some Districts reported upward pressure on commodity prices, they saw   little or no indication of upward wage pressures or of any significant increase   in prices of finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending   strengthened since the last report, with sales of both general merchandise and   autos improving across much of the country. Non-auto sales were reported to have   picked up in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas   City, and San Francisco Districts; sales were described as steady or mixed in   the Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts. St. Louis described   retail sales as below expectations and down from a year earlier. Auto sales   generally improved since the last report, in some cases rebounding from a brief   dip after the "cash-for-clunkers" program ended. Increased vehicle sales were   reported from New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas,   while sales were described as flat or mixed in the Cleveland, Minneapolis,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. A number of Districts reported that   used vehicles have been selling better than new ones.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts also noted that retailers were holding leaner inventories this   holiday season, though some indicate that retailers have recently become more   optimistic about the holiday-season outlook. Auto dealers' inventories, largely   depleted during the cash-for-clunkers program, have been or are being   rebuilt.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism was mixed across those Districts reporting. Travel and   tourism--especially leisure travel--was described as robust or improved in the   New York, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts. Atlanta and Kansas City   characterized tourism as sluggish, while Richmond and Minneapolis described it   as mixed; Richmond noted that tourism has been adversely affected by severe and   damaging coastal storms, while Kansas City characterized the outlook as "grim."   New York indicated that business travel remained sluggish, but Minneapolis and   Dallas note a slight pickup.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the service sector   generally picked up since the last report, though results were mixed across   Districts and across service industries. New York and Philadelphia reported that   service-sector activity overall remained steady to up slightly, while St. Louis   noted expanding activity. The information technology industry was reported to be   showing improvement in the Boston, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts. A   pickup in activity at staffing firms was reported by Boston and Dallas, whereas   New York noted that activity remained sluggish. Strength in health services was   noted in the Boston and Richmond Districts. Shipping activity was characterized   as flat in the Cleveland, Atlanta, and Kansas City District, while Dallas   reports some gain; however, Dallas and Atlanta both noted particular weakness in   rail shipping activity. Professional and business support firms reportedly   registered some improvement in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts but flat   to declining activity in Richmond and San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported mixed to moderately   improving manufacturing conditions since the last report. New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco all noted   modest increases in manufacturing activity within their Districts. Manufacturing   conditions in the Boston and Dallas Districts were characterized as mixed, with   some improvement noted for biopharmaceuticals companies in Boston and high-tech   manufacturing firms in Dallas. By contrast, Richmond and Chicago both reported   that manufacturing activity had leveled off since the last report, while   activity continued to decline in the Atlanta and St. Louis Districts, although   at a somewhat slower pace than the last report. Tighter credit limited the   ability of customers to place new orders in the Richmond District, while in the   Chicago District, contacts noted a slowdown in the restocking of inventories.   Increases in activity related to the transportation industry were cited in the   Chicago, St. Louis, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts, although such activity   was mixed in the Dallas District and reported as declining in the San Francisco   District. Several Districts noted an uptick in food-related production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many Districts reported that their contacts were optimistic about the   near-term outlook. Manufacturers in the Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta,   Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts expected business conditions to improve   in the coming months, while producers in the Cleveland District expressed   uncertainty about near-term conditions. The outlook in the Dallas District was   mixed, with most manufacturers expressing cautious optimism about the near term   and construction-related manufacturers expressing pessimism about the future   largely due to expectations of prolonged weakness in commercial real estate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales and construction   activity improved across much of the nation, though prices were generally said   to be flat or still declining somewhat. A majority of Districts reported that   the lower-priced segment of the housing market has outperformed the high end.   Increases in sales activity were reported in the Boston, Cleveland, Richmond,   Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts,   whereas sales were described as steady or mixed in the New York and Philadelphia   Districts. Multifamily housing markets deteriorated further in the New York and   Chicago Districts. More broadly, a number of eastern Districts reported   continued declines in home prices--specifically, Boston, New York, Philadelphia,   and Richmond. In contrast, prices were said to have firmed somewhat in the   Dallas and San Francisco Districts and stabilized in the Chicago and Kansas City   Districts. Most reports maintained that the lower end of the market has   outperformed the higher end: New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta,   Minneapolis, and Kansas City all noted relative weakness at the high end of the   market, with relative strength at the lower end; in most cases, this strength   was largely attributed to the homebuyer tax credit (which was recently   reinstated and expanded to include existing owners).
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the firming in sales, the level of new residential construction   activity was generally characterized as weak, though recent trends have been   mixed--Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some pickup in home construction,   whereas the Chicago and St. Louis Districts reported declines. Residential   construction was described as flat or stabilizing by Cleveland, Minneapolis, and   San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate conditions were widely characterized as weak and, in   many cases, deteriorating further. Market conditions were reported to have   weakened in virtually all Districts, with rising vacancy rates, downward   pressure on rents, and little, if any, new development. Expectations for 2010   were also quite low. Boston characterized the commercial real estate outlook as   "bleak," Dallas noted that construction was at "historically low levels," and   Kansas City described the sector as "distressed." Still, some Districts noted   scattered signs of encouragement: Cleveland and Chicago referenced public-works   projects as a source of increased business, Richmond noted signs of increased   leasing activity from the health and education sectors, Atlanta indicated a   modest pickup in new development projects, Minneapolis noted some recently   started hotel and retail development, and San Francisco cited slight improvement   in availability of financing for new development.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banks reported steady to softer   conditions in most Districts. Loan demand was said to have weakened in the New   York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. New   York noted particular weakness in demand for home mortgage loans, whereas   Richmond and St. Louis reported this to be the strongest segment of late. For   the most part, the weakness appears to have been concentrated in the commercial   sector, though Boston and Chicago reported some pickup in commercial real estate   lending--largely refinancing. Credit quality showed signs of deteriorating in   the New York, Philadelphia, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts but was   described as stable or mixed in Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City, with   Chicago reporting some improvement outside of commercial real estate.   Increasingly tight credit standards were reported in the New York, Richmond,   Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco--largely on commercial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Excessively wet   conditions during October and early November were reported in a number of   Districts. As a result, the fall harvest was delayed in many parts of the   Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts.   Flooding from Tropical Storm Ida and a November "nor'easter" damaged crops and   delayed planting throughout the Richmond District, and Virginia health officials   closed fishing in all Chesapeake Bay tributaries and temporarily banned the   harvesting of shellfish due to potential storm water contamination. By contrast,   rainfall in the Dallas District helped alleviate drought conditions experienced   in many parts of the region. Contacts in the Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas   City Districts noted that corn and soybean prices rallied over the past month,   although a wide variation in margins was expected for crop farms due to   differences in input costs. Losses for livestock operations occurred in the   Chicago and Kansas City Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most energy-producing Districts reported a slight uptick in activity in   extraction industries since the last report. Contacts in the Cleveland, Atlanta,   Dallas, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts noted steady to   increasing oil and natural gas production within their regions, albeit from low   levels of production observed earlier this year. Contacts in the Cleveland   District also reported that a sharp decline in coal production had leveled out   since the last report. In general, oil prices increased somewhat, while reports   on the price of natural gas were mixed due in large part to differences in   inventory levels across Districts. Mining activity in the Minneapolis District   increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions   remained weak since the last report, with further layoffs, sluggish hiring, and   high levels of unemployment in most Districts. However, contacts in the Atlanta,   Cleveland, and Richmond Districts reported that the pace of job cuts generally   slowed in their regions, and most contacts in the Dallas District reported   stable employment levels. Despite generally weak employment conditions, some   signs of improvement were noted. For example, contacts in Boston reported that   they were beginning to hire and reverse pay cuts or freezes that were   implemented earlier in the year, and contacts in the St. Louis District reported   that the service sector had started to expand recently. Expectations for the   holiday season were mixed across Districts, with contacts in the New York and   Dallas Districts reporting lighter-than-normal seasonal hiring and/or increases   in the hours of existing employees, as opposed to hiring temporary workers, to   meet the seasonal demand. On the other hand, most retailers in the Richmond   District have hired the usual number of seasonal workers this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts generally reported little or no upward wage pressures, while some   Districts noted upward pressure in commodity prices, and most Districts reported   stable selling prices. Wages were largely reported to be holding steady in the   Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco Districts. Most Districts reported stable prices overall, although   some reported higher input prices, largely for energy and other commodities used   in production, with a limited ability to raise selling prices. Prices were   reported as moderately lower in the Kansas City District, and downward price   pressures were cited for some professional services and intermodal   transportation firms in the Dallas District. Some makers of food products and   chemicals in the Philadelphia District reported raising prices, and the prices   of computer memory chips continued to firm in the San Francisco District.   Retailers in several Districts indicated that they have managed inventory levels   in an effort to prevent the steep price discounting that occurred last year,   however, some promotional price discounting is expected through the holiday   season.
