      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions continue to improve in the First District. Contacted   retailers cite sales increases, manufacturers say demand continues to grow, and   advertising and consulting firms report modest revenue increases. Home prices   appear to be improving along with sales in most of the region's residential   markets, while commercial real estate appears to be stabilizing although   potential defaults remain a concern. Most New England employers are no longer   shedding workers, and many are restoring recession-induced cuts in wages and   benefits. Both input and selling prices are mostly said to be stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacted retailers in the First District report   positive sales results for the early months of 2010; year-over-year same-store   sales vary from flat to increases of about 20 percent, with "improved sales   tone" across the board. Contacts attribute the uptick in sales to strengthening   consumer confidence, strong marketing, and having "the right product and the   right price." All respondents are cautiously optimistic in their outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels are primarily on target, although one contact notes a   decrease because of unexpectedly strong sales. Capital spending is more robust   than in previous reports, with contacts spending on new store openings, store   remodels, IT systems and other technology. Several respondents report slight   increases in headcount and the reinstatement of prior wage cuts. Vendor and   selling prices are said to be stable, although one contact notes an increase in   food-related commodity prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturing and   related services contacts headquartered in the First District continue to report   improving demand for their products in the first quarter of 2010. A furniture   maker cites sales increases of more than 20 percent in the first quarter of 2010   relative to a year ago, a metals fabrication business reports similarly robust   revenue growth, and business is also strong at a local semi-conductor firm.   Overall, the manufacturers serving IT, electronics, and business services   industries report the greatest increases in demand. By contrast, firms selling   machinery and equipment to industrial customers and those supplying real   estate-related sectors, especially commercial real estate development, say that   business has stabilized or is improving somewhat, but they expect underlying   demand to remain relatively sluggish for the rest of the year. In addition, some   firms caution that growth in the first half of 2010 appears strong simply   because demand in the first half of 2009 was so weak. There has also been a   bounce in growth at some firms from one-time inventory corrections.
     </p>
     <p>
      Input costs for manufacturers are generally unchanged, with the exception of   most metals, for which prices are rising. Many companies report that they are   holding selling prices steady, although a few have managed (or plan) to   implement modest increases this year; they face limited pressure to reduce their   selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employment situation in the manufacturing sector remains relatively   unchanged. Two notable exceptions are a metals fabrication firm that has   increased its workforce about 15 percent relative to a year ago and a large   diversified equipment and technology manufacturer that expects to continue   layoffs through this year. At most of the remaining firms, hiring in the U.S. is   expected to remain relatively flat or increase only slightly for 2010.   Manufacturers continue to try to restore wage cuts and/or unfreeze wages. Most   firms report instituting or planning to institute modest wage increases of 2   percent to 3 percent this year. Virtually all contacts continue to express   concerns regarding rising health care costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturing respondents report that their planned capital expenditures   for 2010 are level with or slightly greater than their expenditures in 2009.   Most of the firms' domestic capital expenditures will go toward expanding IT   investment and/or their research and development functions. Respondents   commenting on financing conditions say they have improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all the contacted manufacturing firms remain cautiously optimistic   that business conditions will continue to improve as the year progresses. The   consensus, however, is that it may take a while for underlying demand to pick up   substantially, and 2010 may turn out to be a transition year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Selected Business Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most First District   advertising and consulting contacts report modest quarter-over-quarter increases   in revenue in the first quarter of 2010, although some report flat to slightly   negative growth. Nonetheless, all agree that demand is up substantially from the   first quarter of 2009, with one firm's growth exceeding 30 percent. As some   uncertainties about healthcare reform were lifted, for example, consulting   demand from the healthcare sector showed a rapid increase, and this strong   growth is expected to continue throughout the year. Consulting demand from   private equity firms increased slightly as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents made large price cuts in 2009, in the range of 10 percent to   20 percent, with only a few holding their prices steady. Now prices are being   raised, but they remain below their pre-recession levels. Regarding   compensation; some contacts have kept and plan to keep base salaries steady,   while others have raised salaries from 2 percent to 10 percent. Performance   bonuses are generally down. Most respondents intend to maintain current staff   sizes, with only replacement hiring, but a few firms expect to increase   headcounts by 2 percent to 15 percent by the end of the year, and one firm plans   to further downsize by 5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Advertising and consulting contacts generally say they are cautiously   optimistic about the rest of the year, as some uncertainties remain. Most   respondents forecast a slow recovery for their industry and project annual   revenue growth for their firms between 5 percent and 10 percent, although some   expect flat growth. They express concern about the availability of credit and   the possibility of a double dip.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate   fundamentals in New England have been roughly stable since the last report. In   Rhode Island, the uptick in leasing activity seen in January has not been   sustained and sales volume remained weak in recent weeks. Nonetheless, our   contact notes that vacancy and rental rates in downtown Providence have   stabilized. In Boston, leasing activity consists largely of renewals, and   renewing tenants continue to give back significant blocks of space. Boston   contacts have not seen sizable rent declines in recent weeks, but downward   pressure on rents remains significant and tenants are reportedly bargaining hard   for improvements and other concessions. However, owners with weak equity   positions cannot secure financing for improvements and therefore cannot   effectively compete for tenants. Vacancy rates in greater Boston are roughly   flat or up slightly since the last report; apartment vacancy rates in Boston   have increased less in the current downturn than have vacancy rates for office   and industrial properties. In Hartford, the industrial market is currently the   weakest sector, with 1.2 million square feet of vacant space added in the first   quarter of 2010; fundamentals for office and retail properties were little   changed over the same period. While Hartford's commercial real estate market was   described as "stagnant" overall, consumer sentiment in Connecticut was perceived   as improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the investment sales market, contacts report growing demand for commercial   properties by institutional investors and life insurance companies searching for   higher yields. In line with this trend, a commercial real estate lender in   Boston has seen significant sales activity for fully-leased, low-risk   properties, and his bank has lost bids to other, more aggressive lenders. A   local asset management firm recently purchased a prime, mixed-use property in   Boston among competition from multiple bidders. At the same time, investor   sentiment is reportedly mixed as to whether prices have hit bottom, and   significant gaps remain between bidding and asking prices in the riskier   segments of the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking forward, a few contacts express renewed concern about looming   commercial mortgage defaults, as operating incomes and debt-service reserves   continue to fall and equity in many properties remains weak. Defaults are   expected to rise over the next 12 months and possibly beyond. While most   contacts expect leasing volume to rise in the later part of 2010, none expect   rents to increase significantly in the near term and one sees little upside risk   to rents for at least five years, in Boston at least.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets   in New England continued to show mostly positive signs in February. Home sales   increased year-over-year in most parts of the region, with 14 percent increases   in Maine and Massachusetts. Rhode Island home sales, by contrast, declined   slightly year-over-year. Condo sales also increased significantly in   Massachusetts and New Hampshire compared to February 2009. Prices also showed   signs of stabilization as the median price of homes in February increased   modestly year-over-year in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, and   held steady in Maine. The median condo price in Massachusetts increased 13   percent year-over-year in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      While Massachusetts contacts are still concerned about low inventory, the 3   percent year-over-year decline in home listings was actually the smallest   decrease in 23 months. These contacts hope that sellers will come back to the   market as prices rise. Furthermore, the average number of days on market fell   sharply across the region. Real estate brokers have been kept busy by the strong   demand from buyers encouraged by the tax credit and low prices. Unfortunately,   recent flooding in several areas has been a problem for some deals.
