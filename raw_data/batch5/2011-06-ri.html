      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity has been sending increasingly mixed signals since our last   report. The banking sector improved moderately, led by gains in commercial and   industrial lending. Tourism also strengthened, with holiday bookings expected to   be above year-ago levels. Reports on District labor markets were generally   positive; however, employment agents noted that some manufacturing clients were   cautious about hiring. Residential and commercial real estate agents generally   described activity as mixed. Moreover, manufacturing lost momentum, with several   contacts noting that demand had leveled off in recent weeks. In addition,   revenue growth among non-retail service firms weakened, and retailers said that   sales fell over the last month as shopper traffic dropped sharply. Manufacturing   firms reported that input prices grew at a faster pace since our last report,   but pass-through was limited and price growth at services firms remained   moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing cooled in May after   expanding for seven months. Several textile and apparel contacts described their   business as being unpredictable, with "very little depth." Similarly, a producer   of coated steels mentioned that, although the first quarter had been fairly   strong, order volume had been going down since then. Also, a supplier of   specialty materials reported that his business had leveled off in recent weeks   because demand for his customers' goods had slowed. Several contacts stated that   the disruptions in Japan had affected automotive deliveries, due to lack of   electronic components and paints. Firms reported that their customers were   strongly resisting any price increases, despite knowing that commodity prices   were rising. Our latest manufacturing survey revealed that prices of raw   materials rose notably over the last month, but prices of finished goods were up   only moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally slowed since our last   report. Several firms attributed the slowdown to higher gasoline prices. A   central Virginia retailer noted that, even though consumer confidence was good   in the area, buying behavior was "tentative, as customers' needs were   superseding their wants," driving stores to compete aggressively on price.   Apparel and general merchandise retailers reported soft sales, and a large   bookseller in central North Carolina stated that sales had weakened over the   last month. In contrast, a store manager at a big box discount store in Virginia   Beach said sales had improved in the last month and that the store was hiring   again. Most auto dealers that we contacted cited flat-to-stronger sales, despite   scattered reports of inventory or parts shortages caused by the Japanese crisis.   Grocery sales remained solid, and several contacts reported passing through   price increases to their customers. A number of surveyed wholesalers reported   faster revenue growth in recent weeks. Durable goods wholesalers generally noted   a pick-up in revenues despite the reported ongoing slump in retailers'   big-ticket sales. Retail prices edged up, and wages were little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts at non-retail services firms reported   somewhat slower revenue growth in recent weeks. Executives at several healthcare   facilities noted flat demand for services over the last month. One hospital   administrator also expressed uncertainty about the financial effect on his   hospital of the increase in "newly insured" populations under healthcare reform.   He noted significant challenges for smaller, rural hospitals with respect to   information technology investments needed to secure federal matching   opportunities. In contrast, professional, scientific, and technical firms that   we survey reported slightly quicker revenue growth. Price growth at services   firms was mild, while wage increases were widespread. A healthcare system   executive in central Virginia reported that salary pressures were being driven   by shortages in some specialties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity posted modest but broad-based   gains across the District over the last few months. Commercial and industrial   lending expanded, especially for capital equipment and storage facilities.   Several community bankers also cited increasing loan demand from small   businesses. These borrowers had new orders from large manufacturers, who were   subcontracting to keep up with demand. Consumers were starting to use credit   cards again, according to several lenders, and were increasingly seeking   financing for autos and home improvements. However, a contact at a large bank in   North Carolina reported making very few home equity loans, and most bankers   reported seeing little new mortgage lending activity. Most lenders cited   improvement in their balance sheet quality, with delinquencies and charge-offs   down markedly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate agents in the Fifth   District gave varied reports. An agent in the D.C. area described the housing   market as "terrific," noting that April produced the highest number of sales   since June 2005, with the exception of last March and April, when sales were   boosted by the first-time buyer program. In Richmond, however, a contact   mentioned that unit sales had dropped quite a bit, along with foot traffic.   Sales in the lower-price range were reported as faring much better than sales in   the upper ranges. A Realtor in Richmond said that sales of homes in the $400,000   to $1 million price range had increased compared to a year ago. He pointed out,   however, that sales were contingent on the houses being in perfect condition,   with extremely competitive pricing. While most contacts reported that they had   not seen any change in the proportion of distressed sales, one agent noticed an   increase of short sales and stated that the entire short sale process remained a   major issue for buyers. On balance, most contacts said that transaction prices   had either flattened or continued to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity was mixed across market segments and   geographic areas of the District over the last month. Pockets of modest strength   were noted in demand for retail space in the Hampton Roads area, as gains in   retail sales in recent months bolstered retailers' confidence, according to a   local Realtor. A West Virginia Realtor reported that the leasing of office space   had picked up, but both retail and industrial demand remained stagnant. However,   the demand for office space in Baltimore was described as "spotty at best" by   one Realtor. A central Virginia Realtor noted improved commercial leasing   activity and modest gains in demand for the retail space, but leasing of   industrial space was unchanged over the last month. A North Carolina Realtor   reported modest, but widespread improvements in leasing, while several contacts   in the D.C. area cited mostly softer leasing activity over the last few weeks.   Contacts generally characterized rents as having stabilized, and several   Realtors stated that banks were more willing to lend than earlier in the year. A   Maryland contact in commercial construction stated that area contractors were   unable to increase prices due to weak demand, but subcontractors were having   more success at passing though increases in commodity costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor conditions were flat to slightly   stronger since our last report. Several employment agents were upbeat, but noted   localized areas of softness in demand across the District. Some employment   agents indicated that they were placing more permanent workers than they were a   year ago. However, a branch manager of one agency in Raleigh said that some   manufacturing clients remained cautious about hiring decisions due to the   instability of incoming orders. A Hagerstown agent said, "Growth is not surging   forward quite as much as a few months ago, but we are still seeing growth in   demand compared to a year ago." He noted, however, that gains were somewhat   uneven because the demand for extra workers seemed to come and go within short   time frames, indicating volatility in his clients' own sales and production.   Retailers made few hiring changes in recent weeks, following an extended period   of payroll cuts, according to recent survey participants. However, the store   manager at a chain discounter in North Carolina remarked that a local   manufacturer had begun recalling laid-off workers, which included some store   employees; because the manufacturing wages were more attractive than what he   could offer well-qualified applicants, he will cover the vacancies with more   hours for seasonal workers. Services providers continued to add employees,   although the overall pace of hiring in the sector slowed from a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism in the District continued to show signs   of improvement in recent weeks. Airport contacts in Maryland and Virginia   reported strong business travel since our last report. In addition, recreational   industries, restaurants, and hotels noted stronger revenue growth, according to   our contacts. A contact on the North Carolina coastline told us that tourist   activity had increased compared to year-ago levels, and house rentals were up as   much as 20 percent or higher in the last few weeks. A tourism contact in   Washington, D.C. reported that the number of incoming tour buses was unusually   high, and the nation's capital expected more than 500,000 tourists on Memorial   Day weekend.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rain and below-average temperatures hindered   cotton planting in South Carolina and delayed corn and soybean planting in parts   of Virginia and West Virginia. In contrast, cotton planting was almost complete   in Virginia and planting of peanuts was progressing on schedule. In Maryland and   Virginia, vegetable growers continued to plant summer crops and harvesting of   greens and strawberries was well underway. Moreover, an analyst in Maryland   noted that a large amount of good quality hay had been cut and baled, due to   good drying conditions. In addition, pastures continued to green-up. Lastly,   peach conditions in South Carolina and West Virginia ranged from fair to   excellent, with most orchards in good condition.
