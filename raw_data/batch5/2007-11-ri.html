      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Fifth District weakened somewhat  in October and early November as continued softness in retail sales and housing  markets trumped stronger revenue growth at services firms. District retailers  said the pullback in sales and shopper traffic intensified during the early  weeks of the holiday shopping season. Housing activity also softened further as  the pace of home sales continued to cool, inventory levels moved higher, and  reports of price reductions became more widespread. Home mortgage demand  softened as well. Adding to the softer tone, extremely dry conditions continued  to hamper farm operations in many areas. Reports from other sectors were more  upbeat, however. District service providers posted stronger revenues during the  last six weeks, while tourist activity advanced at a healthy clip.  Manufacturing contacts reported a slight uptick in production during early  November and the leasing of commercial real estate space was steady. On the  employment front, the pace of hiring eased, though District labor markets  remained generally tight and wage growth edged higher. Prices at District firms  rose modestly since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Fifth District retail sales activity softened  further in recent weeks. Contacts reported that activity in big-ticket  categories--particularly automobiles and light trucks--continued to slump.  Retailers also said a prolonged stretch of mild temperatures in October and  early November had curbed demand for cold-weather items. Shopper traffic drifted  lower as well. Looking ahead, District merchants were less optimistic about  their sales prospects for the upcoming holiday season. In response, contacts reported  that big-box chains operating in the District had already begun to roll out  holiday discounts--well ahead of Thanksgiving. A Richmond, Va. merchant said he was surprised to  see the national chains "break price" so early. Turning to employment, retail  wages grew modestly, while the pace of hiring tapered off somewhat. Retail  price growth edged higher since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Revenue growth at District services firms  advanced at a faster clip over the past six weeks. Contacts at healthcare,  administrative and professional services firms, in particular, reported steady  demand in recent weeks. In addition, a contact at a District insurance provider  said his firm was on solid footing following a "very benign hurricane season."  Going forward, some contacts expressed concern about the potential impacts of  rising energy costs. On the other side of the coin, District utility providers  told us that a warmer-than-usual autumn had damped their revenue growth. On the  employment front, payrolls expanded at modest pace and wage growth was  tepid.  Prices at District service-providers  were generally flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District manufacturers reported that activity  picked up slightly during the first half of November, following a pullback in  October.  Contacts told us shipments and  new orders expanded at a modest pace in recent weeks.  Gains were particularly solid at electronics,  machinery, paper and plastics firms.   Producers attributed some of the recent increase in activity to a  continued weakening of the dollar.  An  electronics producer in Maryland, for example, told us export  orders rose "dramatically" in November.   Despite the uptick in production, District factories trimmed payrolls  over the past six weeks, while wages grew somewhat faster.  Both raw material and finished good prices increased  at a more measured pace since the end of September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Demand for home mortgages generally continued  to soften since our last report, though scattered reports of increased activity  emerged in recent weeks.  Lending  activity slowed further in Charleston, S.C., and Raleigh, N.C., however, lenders in Washington D.C., and Richmond, Va., speculated that the pullback in  demand might be "close to bottoming out."   In addition, a contact in Greenville, S.C., noted that she was planning to add  loan officers in anticipation of an uptick in business early next year.  Furthermore, a lender in Charlottesville, Va., reported that he had seen lending  activity pick up in the final two weeks of October.  Interest rates on mortgages were steady,  while lenders continued to scrutinize home loan applications closely.  On the commercial side, reports on lending  activity were mixed.  Lenders in Charleston, W.Va., and Charlottesville, Va., reported a slight increase in  activity, while contacts in the Carolinas said demand continued to wane.  Commercial mortgage rates edged lower in most  markets and credit standards remained taut.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential real estate conditions across the  Fifth District eroded further since the end of September.  Realtors said sales activity remained weak,  and reports of home price reductions were more widespread.  Inventories continued to swell.  An agent on the eastern shore of Virginia described his local housing market  as "very depressed," adding that sales in his area were down fifty percent from  last year.  Likewise, a Realtor in Fredericksburg, Va. noted a further slowdown in sales  during October and early November.   Reports were similar in the Washington, D.C. area where a contact described  conditions as "dismal."  An agent in Greensboro, N.C. told us the price and condition of  properties had to be "just right in order to sell."  Nonetheless, a Richmond, Va. contact said some homes priced well  below market "just aren't selling."   Given the prolonged malaise, Realtors told us they continue to advise  clients to "stay put if you can."  There  were a few brighter spots, however.  An  agent in Odenton, Md. reported "decent" activity in recent  weeks, and a contact in Greenville, S.C. told us October sales had been slightly above  year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the  commercial real estate front, reports on District office markets were mixed,  while assessments of retail and industrial leasing were generally upbeat.  Contacts in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Md.  and the Carolinas noted slower office leasing activity in October and early  November, though an agent in Raleigh, N.C., suggested that the "the recent slow  down is only temporary."  On the other  hand, agents in Richmond, Va., Charleston, W.Va., and northern Virginia reported steady office leasing activity  in recent weeks.  Demand for retail space  remained generally strong according to contacts in Virginia Beach, Va., and Columbia, S.C.   Assessments of District industrial markets were mostly positive as  well.  A contact in Charleston, W.Va., said industrial leasing in his area  was in "good shape," and a contact in Columbia, S.C., said his market was "the tightest  it had been in ten years."  Vacancy rates  and rents for office and retail space were generally unchanged since our last  report, while industrial vacancies firmed in several markets.  Reports on new construction varied.  New retail projects were reported in Richmond  Va., Virginia Beach, Va., and Columbia, S.C., whereas a contact in Washington,  D.C., said retail construction had slowed somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports  on tourist activity were generally positive.   Along the coast, contacts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and in Virginia Beach, Va. told us bookings for the  Veteran's Day weekend were somewhat stronger than a year ago.  Another contact on the Outer Banks said  tourism was "keeping the community afloat" as real estate and construction  activity remained sluggish.  Similarly, a  manager at a ski resort in Virginia reported a drop off in sales  of time shares, though he noted bookings were up and tourist spending was  steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Fifth  District temporary employment contacts reported generally strong demand for  workers in recent weeks.  Taut labor  market conditions continued to fuel demand for temporary workers in Raleigh, N.C., and an agent in Bethesda, Md. reported notably firmer demand for  office and retail workers.  Prospects for  future hiring activity remained somewhat cloudy, however.  Agents in several markets expressed concern that  soft holiday sales could lead to a fall off in retail hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Drought conditions persisted and  water restrictions remained in place in many areas of the Fifth District during  October and early November.  In South Carolina, a lack of soil moisture stalled oat  and winter wheat plantings.   Additionally, contacts expressed concern about the adequacy of winter  feed supplies.  There were a few pockets  of improvement, however, as several areas of the District received light  rainfall and experienced cooler temperatures in mid-November.  As a result, pasture conditions improved in  parts of Virginia, reducing the need for supplemental feeding.  Moreover, the recent rainfall in sections of Maryland enabled farmers to make progress on  small grain plantings and the harvesting of corn, cotton and soybeans.
