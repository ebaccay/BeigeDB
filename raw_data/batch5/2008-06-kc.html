      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in  the Tenth District remained modest in early April and May.  Overall, consumer spending was flat and below  expectations.  Manufacturing activity  improved slightly due to rising exports.  Residential real estate activity rose  seasonally and commercial real estate activity held steady.  High commodity prices fueled robust gains in  energy and agricultural sectors.  Labor  markets expanded slightly with some firms noting labor shortages.  Reports of wage pressures moderated, but  input and finished goods prices rose further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Consumer spending remained soft in May, despite  solid travel and tourism activity.   Retail sales were flat compared to the previous survey period and were  below expectations. Store managers expected sales to ease in coming  months.  Mall traffic remained slow,  partly attributed to higher gasoline and food prices limiting purchases of  non-essential goods.  A few retailers  noted weak jewelry sales. After a rebound in March, auto sales slumped,  especially for trucks and SUVs, and access to credit tightened.  Auto dealers anticipated sales to remain sluggish  even with aggressive sales incentives and discounts.  Non-profit organizations and social service  agencies reported more requests for financial assistance from low-income  households. Travel and tourism activity strengthened since the last survey, aided  by a lengthened ski season at many resorts.   Despite route reductions, air travel remained strong, especially in the Denver  market.  However, one travel agent was  pessimistic about future tourism activity as bookings have slowed with higher  fuel costs.  Hotel occupancy and average  room rental prices moved higher, and restaurants reported an uptick in sales  despite a slight increase in menu prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Manufacturing activity improved somewhat  since March and early April, but remained sluggish compared to year-ago  levels.  Export orders strengthened with  several firms citing high overseas demand and increased domestic investment by  foreign firms.  Production and employment  levels stabilized while the volume of shipments increased, reducing inventories.  Expectations for future factory activity were  generally positive, partly due to strong export demand.  Several firms reported that strong sales  growth and high capacity utilization were driving plans to increase capital  spending.  However, plant managers  remained concerned that high input prices and transportation surcharges will  continue to strain profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential real estate activity strengthened  seasonally from the last survey and commercial real estate activity held steady  in late April and May.  Realtors,  mortgage lenders, and moving companies reported a seasonal pickup in sales that  reduced home inventories.  Demand for  lower priced homes was stronger than demand for high-end homes requiring jumbo  mortgages.  Still, one realtor noted the  market for first-time home buyers has slowed because higher living expenses constrained  buyer efforts to save for a down payment.   Residential building permits remained well below year-ago levels  although multi-family construction remained solid.  While home prices continued to edge down in  most major markets, prices in rural and energy-intensive areas remained well  above year-ago levels. Apartment vacancy rates were down across the District,  prompting further rent increases.   Commercial real estate construction remained solid since the last survey  though the number of sales declined.   Commercial vacancy rates edged up and rents stabilized after steadily  increasing over the past year.   Developers reported commercial real estate prices may decline in some  markets where absorption rates are down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Bankers reported tighter  credit standards and somewhat stronger loan demand than in the previous  survey.  Demand for residential real  estate loans and consumer installment loans increased moderately, while demand  for commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, and agricultural loans  remained essentially unchanged.  Half of  respondents reported a tightening of credit standards for commercial real  estate loans, about the same fraction as in the previous survey.   Just under half of respondents reported  tightened standards for commercial and industrial loans, up slightly from the  previous survey.   Some respondents reported  tighter standards for residential real estate and consumer installment  loans.  Similar to the previous survey, just  over half of the respondents said overall loan quality was down from a year  ago.  However, respondents were somewhat  more pessimistic about future loan quality, citing concerns about consumer and  residential real estate loans.  Bank  deposits were little changed.
      <strong>
      </strong>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District energy activity continued at a robust pace in April and  May.  Led by Wyoming,  the number of active drilling rigs surged since the last survey period and  remained well above year-ago levels.   Energy firms planned to expand drilling activity in coming months to  meet expected demand.  Companies reported  that financing and equipment are available, though a shortage of skilled  workers, especially geologists and engineers, continued to be a challenge for  the industry.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural  conditions strengthened further in late April and May.  Recent rainfall across much of the Plains  eased drought concerns and improved pasture and growing conditions.  Despite weather delays, corn planting was  almost complete and soybean planting was in progress.  The winter wheat crop was reported in good  condition and yields were expected to be higher than last year in Kansas  and Oklahoma.  Many local grain elevators have suspended 
offering forward contracts for  wheat due to price volatility and hefty margin calls.  Livestock producers continued to lose money  due to high feed costs.  Farmland values  continued to post record annual gains and farm equipment sales remained robust.  Rapidly rising input costs were expected to  trim farm incomes and limit capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Price  pressures continued to build since the last survey period but wage pressures  held steady.  District manufacturers  reported that rising raw materials prices, especially for steel and fuel, were contributing  to higher prices for finished goods.  Many  District contacts reported paying fuel surcharges.  Farmers reported that higher input costs,  especially for fertilizer, chemicals, seed, and fuel, were trimming profit  margins.  Restaurants were also paying  significantly higher prices for food and passing a portion of the increased  cost to diners.  Retail contacts reported  higher selling prices since the last survey and expected further price increases  in the coming months.  Builders paid  higher prices for some construction materials, such as roofing and metal  supplies, though lumber prices were flat.   District labor shortages persisted, especially for minimum-wage  positions and technically skilled workers, but most firms did not plan to raise  wages.  District hiring announcements  continued to outpace layoff announcements.
