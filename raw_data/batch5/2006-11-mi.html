      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew since the last report. Increases in activity 
  were noted in consumer spending, manufacturing, energy, mining, and agriculture. 
  Meanwhile, tourism activity was mixed, and residential real estate and construction 
  activity decreased. Signs of a tighter labor market were noted. Overall price 
  increases were modest as fuel prices decreased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall consumer spending rose moderately, and prospects for holiday sales were 
  generally positive. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported same-store sales 
  up about 4 percent in October compared with a year ago. Recent sales at a Minneapolis 
  area mall were up 4 percent from a year ago; expectations for the holiday season 
  were positive. Sales at a North Dakota mall were up 3 percent in October compared 
  with last year, according to the mall manager, and store owners were optimistic 
  for the holiday season. According to members of the Minneapolis Fed's board 
  of directors, retailers in the Bozeman, Mont., area are expecting robust holiday 
  sales and retailers in the Billings, Mont., area are expecting sales at levels 
  similar to last year. A survey of holiday spending plans in the Minneapolis-St. 
  Paul area by researchers at the University of St. Thomas suggests that holiday 
  spending in 2006 will be up slightly from 2005. A St. Paul area mall manager 
  said that recent sales activity was comparable with last year. New and used 
  car and truck sales were relatively solid during the past two months, according 
  to an auto dealer in Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall tourism activity was mixed. Fall tourism in northern Minnesota and 
  Wisconsin was up from last year, according to Bank directors. The number of 
  deer hunting licenses issued this fall was slightly above last year's level 
  in Minnesota. After a strong September, October tourism activity was down about 
  7 percent from last year's level in western South Dakota, according to an official. 
  Crossings at the International Bridge in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were 
  down 6 percent in October compared with a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was up. Recent commercial construction activity was 
  robust in the Bismarck, N.D., area, according to a representative of a commercial 
  real estate firm there. The value of October commercial building permits in 
  Sioux Falls, S.D., was about even with last year's record levels, and office 
  construction was up slightly. A Minneapolis developer hired a design firm to 
  begin plans for a large new office tower in its central business district. Plans 
  were announced for the redevelopment of a historic skyscraper into a luxury 
  hotel in downtown Minneapolis. However, residential construction continued to 
  slow. October residential construction permits for Rochester, Minn., were down 
  42 percent in value from a year earlier. The value of new permitted housing 
  in October fell 17 percent in Sioux Falls from last year's record levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity continued at a fast pace. Industrial, retail 
  and office markets in the Minneapolis area saw positive absorption in the third 
  quarter; office absorption is expected to top 1 million square feet there by 
  year end, and lease rates are rising. Residential real estate continued to slide. 
  The median home sales price for Minneapolis-St. Paul fell 1 percent in October, 
  and closed sales were down almost 20 percent. A Bank director in Billings, Mont., 
  reported that home sales were down slightly from a year earlier, but dollar 
  volumes were down more. Preliminary results indicate more than three-quarters 
  of respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook poll (November) expect 
  housing starts to be down in their communities this year, but most don't expect 
  that to adversely affect their sales, profits, investment or hiring.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth was evident in the manufacturing sector. Based on preliminary results 
  from the Minneapolis Fed's annual business outlook poll, respondents from the 
  manufacturing sector expect growth in company sales, employment and capital 
  investment in 2007. Meanwhile, a November survey of purchasing managers by Creighton 
  University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated increased manufacturing activity in North 
  Dakota and Minnesota and reduced activity in South Dakota. A brewery in western 
  Wisconsin is building a new plant. In South Dakota, a visual communication systems 
  manufacturer plans to add a facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining sectors grew since the last report. Oil and 
  gas exploration and production in the District were level with previously reported 
  amounts. However, the alternative energy industry, including wind, biodiesel, 
  and ethanol, continued to expand at a solid pace. In addition, $5 billion worth 
  of new traditional power plants are planned to supply the mines and other industry 
  in northern Minnesota. Mining production remained at near-capacity across the 
  District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity increased since the last report. Higher corn and soybean 
  prices were welcomed by District crop producers. Good harvests were reported 
  in many parts of the District. In Minnesota, the corn harvest was a strong 1.1 
  billion bushels, soybean production was up from last year and a record amount 
  of sugar beets was produced. In addition, record harvests of corn and soybeans 
  were forecast in North Dakota. Meanwhile, most of the winter wheat crop has 
  emerged in good to excellent condition. However, preliminary results of the 
  Minneapolis Fed's third-quarter (October) agricultural credit conditions survey 
  indicate that overall agricultural income will be down in the fourth quarter 
  of 2006 due to higher input costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Signs of a tightening labor market were noted. According to preliminary results 
  of the Minneapolis Fed's business outlook poll, 58 percent of respondents describe 
  securing workers as a challenge or serious challenge. Two boat manufacturing 
  plants in Minnesota are expected to add 140 jobs as a result of company restructuring. 
  Businesses in western Minnesota are having difficulty hiring temporary employees, 
  and a shortage of welders was reported in South Dakota.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, in Minnesota almost 300 jobs at a department store's head offices 
  and a distribution center will be eliminated by next spring, a vending machine 
  manufacturer recently laid off 200 workers, a printing services provider will 
  close a plant resulting in 72 job losses and a newspaper plans to eliminate 
  about 40 positions. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a manufacturer announced 
  plans to lay off 170 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall wage increases were moderate. The aforementioned business outlook 
  poll showed nearly three-quarters of respondents expect wages and salaries in 
  their community's businesses to increase between 2 percent and 3 percent. However, 
  a member of the Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor reported that wages 
  at mines in Montana were up over 10 percent and generous signing bonuses have 
  been offered.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall price increases were modest as prices for fuel declined. Prices for 
  many fuels and natural gas were down since the last report. Mid-November gasoline 
  prices in Minnesota were about the same as they were at the end of September, 
  but down 81 cents per gallon since August. Price increases were noted for roofing 
  shingles and foam rubber.
