      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy increased modestly since the last report.   Increased activity was noted in consumer spending, tourism, residential and   commercial construction, residential and commercial real estate, professional   services, manufacturing, energy and mining. Hiring at district companies   increased slightly, while wage pressures remained generally subdued. Overall   prices were steady with some exceptions noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending grew   moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   September increased over 5 percent compared with a year earlier. A manager at a   Minneapolis area mall reported that traffic in August and September has been   busy, while a mall manager in Montana said "back-to-school" traffic in August   and September was steady. A Minnesota bar and restaurant chain reported that   recent sales were up about 3 percent from a year earlier. A Minnesota   supermarket chain noted that consumers continued to trade downward from high-end   products to value-oriented products. Auto dealers in southern Minnesota reported   that sales were bouncing back to stronger levels; consumers who put off   purchases over the past couple of years are now needing to buy a different   vehicle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fall tourism activity was up slightly. The Minnesota State Fair in late   August and early September was the third-best attended in history, down 1   percent from the 2009 record. Fall tourism was on par with last year in western   South Dakota, according to an official. Meanwhile, a Minnesota travel agency   reported that recent corporate travel was up 15 percent from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction   activity increased slightly since the last report. The value of commercial   building permits in September increased from a year ago in the Sioux Falls,   S.D., area. Commercial construction in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan increased   recently, according to a labor official. In Minnesota, a telecommunications   equipment provider is building a large addition. In Montana, an agricultural   supplier plans to expand its research center. However, a survey by a Minnesota   building contractors association revealed a slight decline in activity over the   past month. Residential construction increased. A bank director noted strong   building activity in North Dakota. The value of residential building permits in   September increased from last year in the Sioux Falls area. A large developer   announced plans to build a $100 million apartment tower in downtown Minneapolis.   However, the value of residential building permits in September decreased from   last year in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets were up slightly. Respondents to a Minneapolis   Fed ad hoc survey indicated a slight increase in the need for additional space   over the next three months. A Minnesota venture capital firm that funds   minority-owned businesses noted an increase in purchases of vacant buildings. A   large broker of retail space in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area noted increased   leasing activity during the past two months. A broker for office space reported   that leasing activity has recently edged up. However, the number of sales   transactions was still low. Home sales in September were up significantly from   the same period a year ago in Minneapolis-St. Paul. August sales in the Sioux   Falls area increased from last year; however, the median price of homes sold in   August decreased from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Professional business services firms reported   increased activity over the past three months. About half of services firms that   responded to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey saw increased sales, while 27   percent saw decreased sales. Respondents noted that profits were also up, and   they expect increased activity over the next three months. A Minnesota software   company experienced double-digit revenue growth over the past two months. A   recent survey of 47 Minnesota architects and engineers revealed increased   activity over the past month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity increased   since the last report. A survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University   (Omaha, Neb.) showed an increase in manufacturing activity in Minnesota and the   Dakotas in September. An ammunition producer is expanding its operations in   Minnesota. An industrial heater producer has expanded operations into a formerly   shuttered vehicle plant in North Dakota. In South Dakota, a plastic sheeting   producer is expanding its production facility, an electronics producer opened a   new plant and a new slaughterhouse should be completed in November after a delay   of several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors continued at a strong pace. Late-September oil exploration activity   increased from mid-August. A company announced plans to begin working on a $300   million wind power plant in southwestern North Dakota. District iron ore mines   continued to operate at near capacity. Activity at Montana mines remains strong,   driven by high metals prices, according to contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Ninth District farmers are expecting smaller   harvests this year, but prices remain elevated. An early frost in late September   may reduce corn and soybean yields around the District. Recent dry weather has   been a boon to wheat harvesters, but overall wheat production in District states   is expected to be about 15 percent lower than last year, according to U.S.   Department of Agriculture estimates. Prices for corn, soybeans, wheat, dairy   products, poultry and hogs fell slightly since the last report; cattle prices   increased recently. In spite of these recent declines, prices for many District   agricultural commodities remained well above their year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hiring at district   companies increased slightly. A Minnesota firm that provides automation   technologies and services to the oil and gas industries announced plans to add   100 workers. A bank will add 90 workers in Minnesota to deal with a surge in   refinancing. A mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was having some   difficulty hiring 90 additional workers. A North Dakota bus plant will add over   50 workers, and a South Dakota health care record processing company will hire   20 new workers. According to a survey of construction-related firms in   Minnesota, 18 percent expect to increase hiring in 2012, while 33 percent expect   to decrease hiring; nevertheless, these responses were more optimistic than last   year's survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage pressures remained generally subdued. However, in North Dakota, some   wage increases were reported due to gains in hiring related to the oil industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall prices were steady with some exceptions noted. Bank directors   reported that generally companies were resistant to increasing prices for their   final products and services over the next six months. Minnesota gasoline prices   were down 40 cents per gallon in early October compared with early September.   However, some business contacts reported recent increases in health care costs.   According to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey, 45 percent of respondents   indicated that input costs were up from a year ago.
