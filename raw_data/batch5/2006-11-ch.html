      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded at a modest pace during 
  October and early November. Consumer spending continued to increase at a gradual 
  rate, and business spending expanded again. Overall labor market conditions 
  were little changed, with small gains in employment on net. Residential construction 
  and real estate activity continued to decline in most areas, while nonresidential 
  construction was steady on balance. Manufacturing expanded at a modest pace. 
  Lending activity moderated further. Overall, nonwage price pressures eased a 
  bit, while overall wage increases were similar as in the previous reporting 
  period. Prices for corn and soybeans rose, as this year's yields turned out 
  to be smaller than were expected in September.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to increase at a gradual rate in October. Retailers 
  said Halloween sales were "positive," and one contact thought this boded well 
  for the holiday shopping season: "If they'll spend at Halloween, just think 
  how much they'll spend at Christmas!" Nonetheless, retailers were said to have 
  taken a conservative approach to inventories. Restaurant sales were higher than 
  expected over the past six to eight weeks; one contact suggested that lower 
  gas prices helped support demand. Auto dealers reported that sales remained 
  relatively steady in recent weeks, though showroom traffic was soft. Tourism 
  was similar to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending and hiring rose again in the District. For the most part, 
  capital spending continued to increase at similar rates as in the previous reporting 
  period. A toolmaker reported plans for further capacity expansions in 2007, 
  a restaurant chain increased its planned outlays for renovations, and a manufacturer 
  noted continued strong levels of spending on high-tech equipment. Overall, labor 
  market conditions were little changed, with small gains in employment on net. 
  Manufacturing employment was mixed by industry. Toolmakers increased employment 
  but noted continued shortages of skilled workers. In contrast, an automaker 
  said that the planned reductions in their workforce were running ahead of their 
  targets. A temporary help services provider said that billable hours growth 
  in the District was a bit softer, but the firm's outlook was favorable as forward 
  orders had maintained their previous trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction and real estate activity continued to decline in most 
  areas and market segments. One notable exception was the Milwaukee area, where 
  homebuilders reported high traffic through model homes and strength in the construction 
  of upper-end homes. One contact said that lot sales were soft and that some 
  people who already owned lots were waiting for construction costs to come down 
  before building. Nonresidential construction was steady on balance: new development 
  was flowing at a steady pace, and there were few reports of project cancellations. 
  A contact in Michigan reported strong demand for medical space, while net absorption 
  of office space in Chicago slowed. Commercial rents were creeping up in Indianapolis, 
  but flat in Michigan and Illinois.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded at a modest pace in October and early November. 
  Sales of large- and medium-sized heavy equipment continued to grow at solid 
  rates. Demand for equipment related to nonresidential construction was expected 
  to expand at a slower rate in 2007, while demand for smaller equipment used 
  in home construction was expected to decline further. Manufacturers of machine 
  tools and equipment parts reported continued strong order growth in most market 
  segments outside of motor vehicles. One partmaker noted that demand was led 
  by the electronics and semiconductor industry. Another toolmaker noted that 
  its exports continued to grow faster than the rest of its business. Light vehicle 
  manufacturers reported softer sales nationwide. They indicated that there was 
  little room to alter production plans for the fourth quarter but cuts in the 
  first quarter schedules were possible. A steelmaker noted that vehicle production 
  cuts continued to show through in weaker orders for flat-rolled steel, but other 
  segments of the steel market were slowing as well and were expected to remain 
  sluggish through the first quarter. Steel production in the Midwest was said 
  to be slowing more sharply than in the rest of the nation. Steel inventories 
  moved further above desired levels. Wallboard shipments fell, and capacity utilization 
  in the industry declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity moderated further. Bankers noted continued stagnation in mortgage 
  applications for home purchases. But refinancing activity firmed in October 
  and early November as lower interest rates stimulated demand. Demand for new 
  home equity loans declined further, but the usage rate of existing credit lines 
  ticked up. Household credit quality generally remained in good shape: delinquency 
  rates on mortgages were stable, but delinquencies on home equity loans edged 
  up. Retail deposit growth slowed, as some depositors sought higher returns in 
  money market accounts. Business loan demand was flat. Lending for equipment 
  and inventories remained steady, but real estate lending leveled off following 
  a period of solid gains. A banker in the Chicago area said that institutional 
  real estate investors remained active, though there had been some slowdown by 
  smaller investors. Commercial lending conditions continued to be competitive 
  and interest rate margins remained narrow. One banker noted that commercial 
  real estate borrowers were starting to seek interest-only and other alternative 
  loan structures. Commercial credit quality remained in good shape, with steady 
  ratios of non-accruing loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      On balance, nonwage price pressures eased a bit, while overall wage increases 
  were similar as in the previous reporting period. Several contacts reported 
  continued declines in energy costs, and a few transportation firms had begun 
  rolling back surcharges. Prices for hot rolled and scrap steel declined, and 
  wallboard prices also fell. In contrast, toolmakers reported further price hikes, 
  and many food prices increased as well. There were no reports of significant 
  changes in price movements at the retail level. One automaker increased discounting, 
  and incentive activity was expected to increase further as inventory levels 
  remained high. Wage increases continued at similar rates as in the previous 
  reporting period. A temporary help firm noted that wages for high-skilled positions 
  were moving "appropriately" higher, but their customers were reluctant to increase 
  wages for lower-skilled positions, even though these jobs were getting a bit 
  more difficult to fill.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most farmers completed their harvest during the reporting period. Corn and soybean 
  yields were at least average, though not as good as expected last reporting 
  period. Corn and soybean prices increased to substantially higher levels than 
  a year ago. Many farmers held grain off the market as they waited for prices 
  to move even higher. Contacts indicated that more farmers than usual already 
  had locked in prices for the next growing season and some were writing contracts 
  for even farther in the future. Ethanol production kept rising, but some plans 
  for new plants and expansions of existing facilities have been postponed or 
  put on hold. In some cases, construction delays stemmed from the lack of availability 
  of equipment for the plants. In other cases, investors reassessed the feasibility 
  of their plans based on the rapid increase in ethanol supply and zoning issues. 
  Livestock and poultry operations were hurt by higher feed costs. In addition, 
  District dairy producers struggled with low milk prices.
