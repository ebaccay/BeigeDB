      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Eighth District has continued to expand at a modest pace   since our previous survey. Retail and auto sales in July and early August   increased over year-earlier levels. Residential real estate market conditions   have continued to improve moderately. However, commercial and industrial real   estate conditions have been mixed. Recent reports of planned activity from   services firms have been positive. In contrast, reports from manufacturing   contacts have been mixed. Reports of lending activity at a sample of large   District banks during the second quarter of 2012 were somewhat mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in   July and early August were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels.   About 42 percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 33 percent   saw decreases and 25 percent saw no changes. Half of the retailers noted that   sales levels met their expectations and half noted that sales were below   expectations. About 13 percent of the retailers noted that their inventories   were too high, while 8 percent reported that their inventories were too low. The   sales outlook through the fall was generally optimistic: 70 percent of the   retailers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, 17 percent expect sales to   decrease, and 13 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that sales in July and early August were   up, on average, compared with last year's sales. About 67 percent of the car   dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 8 percent saw decreases and 25   percent saw no changes. A third of the car dealers surveyed noted that new car   sales had increased relative to used car sales, while 13 percent reported the   opposite. Roughly 29 percent of contacts reported an increase in sales of   low-end vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while about 13 percent reported   the opposite. Twenty-five percent of the car dealers surveyed reported that   their inventories were too low, while 17 percent reported that their inventories   were too high. The sales outlook for September and October was generally   optimistic: 67 percent of the car dealers expect sales to increase over 2011   levels, 16 percent expect sales to decrease, and 17 percent expect sales to be   similar to last year's sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports of   plans for manufacturing activity have been mixed since our previous report.   Several manufacturers reported plans to expand operations and hire new workers,   while fewer manufacturers reported plans to lay off workers. However, the   reported plans for layoffs usually involved a greater number of workers relative   to the reported hiring plans. Firms in automobile, medical technology products,   carbon and graphite products, air purification equipment, electrical equipment,   automobile parts, metal can, nanotechnology, lifting equipment, and industrial   machinery manufacturing reported plans to expand operations and hire new   workers. In contrast, firms in air transportation, chemical, appliance, wind   turbine, and aluminum manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers and close   plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of planned activity in the District's service sector have been   positive since our previous report. Firms in financial, medical, information   technology, business support, transportation, home healthcare, and environmental   consulting services reported plans to open new facilities, expand operations,   and hire new employees. In contrast, firms in information and education services   reported plans to reduce operations and decrease employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Home sales increased   throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with   the same period in 2011, June 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 13 percent in   Louisville, 7 percent in Little Rock, 10 percent in Memphis, and 16 percent in   St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District.   June 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in the majority   of the District metro areas compared with the same period in 2011. Permits   increased 42 percent in Louisville, 14 percent in Little Rock, 46 percent in   Memphis, and 23 percent in St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate conditions were mixed throughout most   of the District. A contact in northeast Arkansas reported that except for   Jonesboro and Paragould, overall commercial real estate activity remains weak in   the region. A contact in Louisville noted that compared with the first five   months of 2012, the growth of office leasing activity has slowed. A contact in   St. Louis reported moderate improvement in office real estate activity and   strong demand in the industrial real estate market. Commercial and industrial   construction activity improved throughout most of the District. Contacts   reported several commercial construction projects in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and in   Bowling Green, Kentucky, while contacts in Louisville noted new speculative   construction plans in nearby Jeffersonville, Indiana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks indicated moderate changes in overall lending   activity in the second quarter of 2012 compared with the first quarter of 2012.   During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans   remained largely unchanged, while demand for such loans increased moderately.   Credit standards for commercial real estate loans remained generally unchanged,   while demand ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger. Credit   standards for prime residential mortgage loans also remained generally   unchanged, while demand ranged from unchanged to moderately stronger. Credit   standards for consumer loans ranged from basically unchanged to somewhat eased,   while demand was moderately stronger, especially for auto loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Severe drought   conditions have caused downgrades to forecasted crop production. Annual 2012   production of cotton, soybean, and corn in the District states is expected to   fall from 2011 levels by 12 percent, 18 percent, and 24 percent, respectively.   In contrast, annual production of rice and sorghum in the District states is   expected to increase by at least 12 percent. The fraction of all crops rated in   fair or better condition has fallen in all District states since the previous   report. Similarly, the fraction of pasture rated in fair or better condition   declined in all District states. The District states' year-to-date coal   production for the end of July was 3.4 percent higher compared with the same   period last year. Meanwhile, the District states' coal production for July 2012   was approximately on par with July 2011.
