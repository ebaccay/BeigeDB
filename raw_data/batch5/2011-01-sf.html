      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 12, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy firmed further during the reporting period of   late November through the end of December. Price pressures for final goods and   services remained limited despite increases for selected raw materials, and   upward wage pressures were largely absent. Holiday retail sales were up notably   compared with a year earlier, and demand continued to expand for consumer and   business services. District manufacturing activity grew further on net, with   sustained improvement noted for metal fabricators. Production activity remained   solid for agricultural producers, and demand grew on balance for providers of   energy resources. Home sales and construction stayed sluggish, and conditions   continued to be weak overall in commercial real estate markets. Reports from   District banking contacts indicated that loan demand was little changed from   existing low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures remained subdued   on balance. Price increases were noted for assorted raw materials, such as   cotton, copper, aluminum, and especially oil. However, final prices for most   retail items and services continued to be held down by tepid demand and vigorous   competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts in most sectors characterized wages as essentially flat, although   some continued to point to substantial increases in the costs of health   insurance and other employee benefits. The most significant wage pressures were   reported for workers with advanced skills in high-tech fields, for whom demand   has been growing at a brisk clip in some parts of the District. Contacts in most   sectors expect hiring activity to pick up over the next six months, but to a   very modest degree, suggesting that wage pressures overall will remain quite   limited during the first half of 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales increased notably   compared with the prior holiday season. Both traditional department stores and   smaller specialty retailers reported that holiday sales exceeded their   expectations, which were for modest growth. Moreover, tightly controlled   inventories enabled many retailers to rely less heavily on price discounts and   promotional activity than in the recent past. The pace of sales improved   modestly for grocers compared with the prior reporting period, while it remained   largely unchanged at a slow pace for retailers of furniture and major   appliances. Demand for new automobiles continued to strengthen, particularly for   light trucks. Demand for used vehicles was strong as well, and the resulting   high trade-in values reportedly helped spur sales of new vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand increased further for business and consumer services on balance. Sales   continued to expand for providers of technology services, including biomedical   products, but they remained largely flat for providers of professional and media   services. Restaurants and other food-service providers noted further modest   improvements in demand, and suppliers of energy services reported increased   deliveries to end-use customers. By contrast, providers of health-care services   reported that demand weakened slightly in recent months. Conditions continued to   improve for businesses in the travel and tourism industry. Contacts from several   major markets in the District noted increases in visitor volumes and hotel   occupancies, which resulted from rising business travel as well as tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District   continued to expand during the reporting period of late November through the end   of December. Demand grew further for manufacturers of semiconductors and other   technology products, with contacts noting balanced inventories and high levels   of capacity utilization. Production rates remained at or near capacity for   makers of commercial aircraft and parts, as an existing order backlog for larger   aircraft was reinforced by rising orders for smaller commercial jets. Metal   fabricators saw further increases in demand; sustained improvement has brought   capacity utilization back near normal and prompted some firms to rehire   employees laid-off over the past two years. Petroleum refiners continued to   reduce their output and work down inventories, which have been at elevated   levels in recent months. Conditions remained depressed for manufacturers of wood   products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand was   solid for agricultural products, and activity was stable to up slightly for   extractors of natural resources used for energy production. Orders and sales   remained robust for a variety of crop and livestock products, especially cotton   and cattle. Outside of price increases for livestock feed, reports indicated   that input costs were generally stable. Demand for crude oil grew further,   spurred by robust demand from emerging economies combined with modest growth in   domestic demand. For natural gas, ample inventories kept extraction activity   largely flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand in District   residential and commercial real estate markets was largely unchanged at very low   levels. The pace of home sales remained quite slow throughout the District. In   addition, an abundance of foreclosed properties and short sales kept inventories   of available homes elevated in most areas, which put downward pressure on prices   and the pace of new home construction. Demand for rental space grew in some   areas, however, with a Seattle contact noting a modest increase in construction   of apartment buildings there. Conditions continued to be weak on balance in   commercial real estate markets, as vacancy rates stayed high in many parts of   the District; rent reductions and other concessions by landlords remained   common. In a positive sign, however, investor demand for well-leased office   buildings continued to boost market values in some of the District's major   commercial markets, such as San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand was largely stable compared with the prior   reporting period. Businesses continued to be cautious regarding capital   spending, which held the volume of new commercial and industrial loans at low   levels. However, contacts noted a slight uptick in utilization of existing lines   of credit for businesses. Consumer loan demand remained weak overall, and   contacts reported a significant decline in mortgage refinancing, which they   largely attributed to the recent rise in long-term interest rates. Lending   standards remained relatively restrictive for most types of consumer and   business loans, although reports suggested modest ongoing improvements in   overall credit quality. Venture capital financing was a bright spot, with   contacts noting increased investor interest and funding for early-stage   technology companies during the reporting period.
