      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity in the Ninth District was up slightly from the time   of the last report. The services, manufacturing, energy, mining and residential   real estate sectors saw moderate increases. Agriculture and tourism were mixed,   while consumer spending was stable. Decreases in activity occurred in commercial   construction and real estate. Labor markets remained lackluster, but signs of   improvement were noted. Meanwhile, wage increases were modest, and overall   prices remained level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall retail spending was   stable. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   October were essentially even with a year earlier. While one Minneapolis area   mall saw a 2 percent decrease in traffic during October, another saw a 2 percent   increase; store owners expect holiday sales to match last year's levels or   decrease slightly. Sales at a Montana mall were down slightly in September   compared with a year ago; stores have pulled back on inventory going into the   holiday season, according to the mall manager. A Minnesota-based restaurant   chain reported that patronage has stabilized after heavily discounting its menu.   A Minnesota auto dealer reported that vehicle inventories have been built back   up following the "cash for clunkers" program; recent new car sales were flat,   while used car sales were strong. In southwestern Montana, two new second-hand   stores have opened and an existing thrift store is considering expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism conditions were mixed. A Minnesota-based travel agency noted that   business travel was up slightly in September and October compared with a year   earlier, while leisure travel was down about 20 percent. However, holiday   bookings were up slightly compared with last year. Another Minnesota-based   travel agency reported that October showed improvement for both business and   leisure travel, although levels were still below a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was   slow. A commercial builder in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area said there were few   projects beginning or under way there. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis   Fed's business outlook poll indicated that more than 80 percent of overall   construction industry respondents expect sales to be down or unchanged in 2010.   In contrast, a bank director from Billings, Mont., noted several large retail   and hotel project starts in the third quarter. Residential construction showed   signs of stabilization. The value of October permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., was   up 4 percent from a year earlier. A $13 million condominium project began in   Escanaba, Mich.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets saw continued sluggish activity. A Minneapolis   area commercial real estate firm reported that vacancy increased in all sectors   in the third quarter, with the largest increases in the office and industrial   markets. Retail vacancy increased in markets across the District. Meanwhile, the   residential market continued to recover. The dollar volume of closed sales in   Minneapolis-St. Paul increased nearly 16 percent in October from a year earlier.   Overall sales in Duluth, Minn., were down from a year earlier, but sales of   homes under $150,000 were up as first-time homebuyers took advantage of federal   tax credits. In contrast, the high-end home market in western Montana was very   slow, according to contacts there.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall activity was up in the professional   business services sector. Based on results from the business outlook poll,   respondents from the services sector expect increased sales in 2010 but   decreased investment in equipment. Contacts from information technology and   accounting industries noted an upturn in activity over the past three   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was up. Based on   results from the business outlook poll, respondents from the manufacturing   sector expect increased sales in 2010. Preliminary results of a November   manufacturers survey by the Minneapolis Fed and the Minnesota Department of   Employment and Economic Development indicated that manufacturers expect   increased orders and production in 2010 after low levels in 2009. An October   survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that   manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and the Dakotas. A gun barrel   producer plans to open a new facility in South Dakota. An electric heater maker   in North Dakota is slowly increasing production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased slightly. Mid-November oil and gas exploration increased from   early October. Several District power lines to transport wind energy were   planned or under way. Since the last report, an iron ore mine in northern   Minnesota restarted a furnace line and increased production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture was mixed. The Minneapolis Fed's   third-quarter (October) survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated that   lenders expect overall agricultural income and spending to be down in the fourth   quarter. The harvest is behind the pace of a year ago for most major District   crops, and a wet October has created mold problems for some producers. However,   production is expected to increase for corn and soybeans from last year's large   crop. The U.S. Department of Agriculture increased its estimate of corn and   soybean prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained   lackluster, but signs of improvement were noted. A Minnesota shoe manufacturer   recently announced plans to lay off 60 workers after operating at reduced   capacity for a number of months. A Minnesota-based staffing services company   noted that recent temporary placements in manufacturing firms were down 15   percent compared with a year ago, but demand has recently stabilized. October   initial claims for unemployment insurance were 24 percent higher than a year ago   in Minnesota. According to the business outlook poll, 17 percent of respondents   expect to increase staffing levels next year while 25 percent expect to decrease   staff; a year ago 34 percent expected increases while 21 percent expected   decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, a cleaning products manufacturer was adding 200 sales positions   in Minnesota, while another company will create 160 customer service and   management jobs over the next six months in South Dakota. Meanwhile, another   staffing services firm reported increased requests for workers in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases were modest. Results of the business outlook poll show that   100 percent of respondents expect wages in their communities to increase no more   than 3 percent next year; a majority expect increases of no more than 1 percent.   A bank director noted that recent compensation levels in the agricultural   industry in eastern Montana and western South Dakota were on par with last   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices remained relatively level. According to the survey of manufacturers,   23 percent of respondents expect to increase their product prices over the next   12 months while 24 percent expect to decrease prices. Bank directors reported   that prices for steel, industrial grade lumber and zinc were up, while prices   for cattle were down.
