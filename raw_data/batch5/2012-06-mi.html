      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew at a modest to firm pace since the last report.   Strength was noted in consumer spending, tourism, professional services, real   estate, construction, manufacturing, energy and mining, and agriculture. Firms   reported difficulties hiring qualified candidates, although wage increases   remained modest. Price increases were generally subdued.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased   modestly. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased just over 1   percent in April compared with a year ago; the soft gains were attributed to an   earlier Easter holiday and warmer weather in February and March, which likely   pulled sales earlier into the year. Recent sales were up slightly at a   Minneapolis area mall where a number of stores were undergoing or planning   renovations. A Montana bank director reported that vehicle sales were up from a   year earlier and a representative of an auto dealers association in North Dakota   reported strong sales during the past two months, particularly in the western   part of the state. Recent sales at grocery stores owned by a Minnesota-based   company were down slightly. Meanwhile, a Minnesota-based electronics retailer   announced plans to close six stores in Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism officials and businesses were cautiously optimistic about the   upcoming summer season. According to a survey of Minnesota lodging and camping   properties, 39 percent of respondents expect summer occupancy to be up, while 15   percent expect decreases from a year ago. Officials in South Dakota reported an   increase in the number of tourism information requests; early warm weather   increased visits to a number of attractions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity   increased from a year ago. The value of commercial building permits in the Sioux   Falls, S.D., area was up in April from a year earlier. The value and number of   new commercial permits increased in Fargo, N.D., during 2012 compared with the   same period in 2011. Several new commercial building projects are under   consideration in the Minneapolis area. However, respondents to the University of   St. Thomas's semiannual Minnesota Commercial Real Estate Survey (May) expected   higher land and building costs, which could dampen growth in construction.   Residential construction increased from a year ago. The value of residential   building permits increased significantly in the Sioux Falls area in April. The   number of single-family building permits increased in Minnesota in March 2012,   compared with March 2011. Numerous new multifamily projects were planned for   several parts of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate market activity increased. According to the   aforementioned University of St. Thomas survey, respondents expected growth in   commercial rents and occupancy. Several large Minnesota companies recently   renewed or signed new leases for additional office space. A real estate   consultancy reported that industrial vacancy rates in the Minneapolis area   decreased in the first quarter of this year compared with the fourth quarter of   last year; however, office and retail vacancy rates increased. Increases in   residential real estate sales continued across most of the District. Home sales   in April were up 7 percent from the same period a year ago in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area; the inventory of homes for sale was down 29 percent   and the median sales price rose by 12 percent. In the Sioux Falls area, April   home sales were up 11 percent, inventory was down and the median sales price   rose 4 percent relative to a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at professional business services firms   increased slightly since the last report. An engineering and design firm near   oil producing areas of the District reported extremely strong demand for   construction developments. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's annual   survey of professional services companies in May showed that sales revenue,   space usage, and profits are expected to increase over the next year. A   medium-sized Minnesota services firm commented that they "feel optimistic and   are trying to improve efficiency."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand   since the last report. An April survey of purchasing managers by Creighton   University (Omaha, Neb.) found that production expanded in Minnesota and the   Dakotas. A light industrial manufacturer in South Dakota reported the strongest   capital expenditure levels in 10 years as it developed a successful niche   business line. A cement factory in Rapid City, S.D., is considering a $100   million expansion. A steel mill in Minnesota announced a $50 million investment   in upgrades.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors grew. Oil and gas exploration activity increased in North Dakota and   Montana since the last report. A biodiesel refinery in Minnesota announced a $20   million upgrade to switch feed stocks from soybean oil to waste fats. District   iron ore mines continued to operate at near capacity. Montana hard-rock mines   were also busy, with numerous expansions underway across the state. However,   District limestone quarries were still suffering from reduced cement demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The agricultural sector maintained its   strength. Warm spring weather allowed farmers to get into fields early and   plantings of corn, spring wheat and soybeans in mid-May was well ahead of   average in District states. In addition, recent rains alleviated drought   conditions that had persisted until recently in Minnesota and the Dakotas. The   Minneapolis Fed's first quarter (April) survey of agricultural credit conditions   indicated that most lenders saw continued increases in farm household income and   capital spending, though respondents expect growth to moderate over the next   three months. Agricultural output prices have come down somewhat recently. April   prices received by farmers for soybeans, cattle and chickens increased from a   year earlier; prices declined for wheat, corn, hogs, dairy products and eggs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of employers with   open positions noticed tightening in the labor market. Manufacturers in several   areas reported difficulty recruiting skilled workers, particularly welders.   Agriculture operations in the western part of the District noted difficulty   finding workers for certain positions. An aircraft maintenance company recently   confirmed plans to expand its operations in Minnesota with potential hiring of   up to 225 people. In North Dakota an equipment manufacturer announced plans to   create 200 jobs and in northwestern Wisconsin a recreational vehicle   manufacturer will add almost 90 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, a surprising number of lay-offs were reported recently. A food   manufacturer announced plans to cut over 400 positions in Minnesota as part of a   restructuring strategy. Also in Minnesota a medical devices company will lay off   220 employees and a cleaning products manufacturer laid off 70 information   technology workers. An aerospace manufacturer will close a plant in northwestern   Wisconsin, affecting 130 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A larger number of businesses reported wage increases, but the size of   increases remained modest. According to a recent Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey   of business contacts, 65 percent reported that their companies were facing   higher wages. Larger wage increases were reported in the oil drilling region of   western North Dakota and eastern Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price pressures were generally subdued since the last report, although 73   percent of respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey reported upward   input cost pressures. Late-May Minnesota gasoline prices were about 15 cents per   gallon lower than mid-April and 35 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. A   number of metals prices decreased since the last report. A recent budget   proposal for the University of Minnesota includes a 3.5 percent increase for   in-state undergraduates, the smallest percentage increase in 12 years.
