      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continues to exceed year-earlier levels according to most   business contacts in the First District. Retailers cite somewhat more positive   results than they did six weeks ago. Manufacturers report continued growth,   although some at a slower pace recently than in the first half of the year.   Consulting industry contacts also indicate sales are higher than a year ago.   Commercial real estate markets remain in the doldrums, while sales of   residential properties remain below year-earlier levels, as they have since the   expiration of homebuyer tax credits. Hiring among retail, manufacturing, and   consulting firms remains limited and these contacts expect continued growth,   albeit at a modest pace. Indeed, across all sectors, the outlook appears to be   "more of the same."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retailers report mixed sales   results for September and early October. Year-over-year same-store sales range   from decreases in the low single digits to increases in the mid single digits.   Contacts note that consumers are increasingly responsive to "getting a good   deal;" those with increases attribute the uptick in sales to strong marketing,   promotional activity, or stocking "the right mix of products" at discounted   prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels are in line with expectations and capital spending is   generally on target. Headcounts are either stable or growing modestly, with most   increases attributed to new store growth. One respondent notes significant cost   increases for food commodities, particularly dairy, nuts, and bacon. The   majority of contacts believe the recovery will be slow and steady, and even   those retailers reporting sales increases characterize themselves as cautiously   optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all contacted   manufacturing firms report continued sales growth in the second half of the year   after very strong first-half results. One semiconductor firm reports record   sales and profitability in the third quarter and other firms selling into   semiconductor-related markets also report robust growth. Some of this growth is   fueled by strong demand overseas, but some is also coming domestically from the   auto industry. Business also remains very strong at a technology services firm.   However, a number of firms note that even as sales continue to increase on a   year-over-year basis, demand has slowed relative to the first half of 2010. One   firm, which manufactures products for the residential real estate market,   attributes this deceleration to some of its customers destocking after buying in   anticipation of second half demand that never fully materialized; this firm   expects sluggish demand going forward. Overall sentiment amongst responding   manufacturers is that demand will continue to be subdued for the rest of the   year and into 2011, although few, if any, expect conditions to worsen.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels at most contacted firms remain low, and a few are trying to   bring their inventories down further. Many respondents reduced inventories in   response to the economic turmoil in 2008 and 2009 and plan to maintain low   inventories and lean operations going forward to improve profitability. In   contrast, one semiconductor firm has a large backlog of orders and is struggling   to keep up with demand from the auto industry. A few firms are facing pricing   pressures from rising input costs. In particular, the cost of steel and copper   continue to rise as does the cost of wheat, which is used by a food products   manufacturer. One responding firm increased prices modestly earlier in the year   and anticipates having to raise prices another 1 percent to 3 percent between   now and the first quarter of next year to cover rising steel costs. Other   companies facing price pressures have strategically increased prices for some of   their products and have met little resistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hiring continues to be limited amongst contacted manufacturing firms; the few   companies noticeably increasing headcount are doing so overseas. Several   companies are hiring to replace workers lost to attrition or retirement, but   nearly all respondents are maintaining their existing U.S. headcounts. These   firms say they do not plan to do any substantial hiring until the demand   environment noticeably improves and current levels of economic and fiscal   uncertainty subside.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending plans at most manufacturers remain moderate. Most contacted   firms continue to report that capital expenditures are in line with plans; none   anticipates any big changes in capital spending heading into 2011, although   nearly all report that their current financial position and ability to invest   are excellent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, the firms contacted are slightly less optimistic about growth in   2011 than in the last few conversations. This softer outlook reflects both the   recent softening of demand relative to earlier in 2010 and continued uncertainty   surrounding consumer demand and the regulatory and tax environments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Selected Business Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consulting contacts in the   First District all agree that demand improved significantly in the third quarter   compared to a year ago. Most saw a slight decline in demand during July and   August due to seasonality and a modest increase in demand during September. By   exception, a healthcare consulting firm saw revenues rise 10 percent in the   third quarter and 25 percent year-over-year; this contact explains that   businesses are still responding to regulatory changes following healthcare   reform, which keeps demand for healthcare consulting services strong. Another   contact cites increased activity from IT companies and the private equity   sector, but notes demand from the construction industry is still lagging.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are stable for most consulting contacts, with the exception of one   firm that raised prices 5 percent. While not raising list prices, contacts have   been able to eliminate discounts they offered to maintain business throughout   2008 and 2009. While most consulting respondents are only replacing workers   leaving through natural attrition, some added a small number of new employees,   increasing headcounts by 5 percent to 10 percent; one firm, by contrast, expects   to downsize slightly next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Based on improved demand seen in September and early October, all the   consulting contacts are optimistic about the last quarter of 2010 as well as   about next year's performance. Most expect about 10 percent annual growth for   2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from commercial real   estate contacts are mixed. In Boston, office leasing volume remains limited,   with activity flat since August and weaker than during the first half of 2010.   Boston's net absorption for office space is perceived as negative, while   apartment vacancy rates are falling. In Portland, leasing volume has been flat   since the last report but is up year-over-year, while competition for tenants   remains aggressive. A Providence contact is more upbeat, describing net   absorption as positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      In positive news from the sales market, Boston's Hancock Tower sold recently   at a markup of 40 percent over its foreclosure auction price in March 2009. In   contrast, a downtown Boston office building with high vacancies is being sold   for less than half of its 2007 price. Despite uneven performance and limited   volume in the big-ticket property market, a Boston-based bank that targets   smaller-ticket properties is having one of its best years ever in terms of   commercial real estate loans booked, although most of its lending activity   involves refinancing rather than new acquisitions. The bank also reports that a   previously non-performing retail-property loan resumed payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Boston contacts do not expect significant commercial real estate improvements   in the near future unless the labor market heats up considerably. A Providence   contact is optimistic that leasing volume will hold up in the coming months, but   also noted some risks on the horizon. A Portland contact expects his firm's   brokerage volume to improve in 2011 over 2010 and sees potential expansion in   some (but not all) sectors of Portland's economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales figures for single-family   homes and condos continued to come in below their year-earlier levels in August.   Contacts throughout New England say the expiration of the tax credit coupled   with a weak economy has slowed the housing market. Meanwhile, the median prices   of homes and condos rose in August compared to last year, except in New   Hampshire where the median home price slipped 2.7 percent. Inventory continues   to rise throughout the region; most contacts interpret the increasing number of   listings as a sign of confidence among sellers. Contacts in Massachusetts and   Rhode Island believe the greater choice of inventory may help draw buyers into   the market; by contrast, very high levels of inventory in New Hampshire are   causing concern.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pending sales figures for Massachusetts suggest that September's final sales   will also be below a year ago. Contacts around the region forecast flat sales or   continued year-over-year declines for the rest of 2010. As of August, all six   New England states report year-to-date home sales above last year, but most   contacts expect that by the end of the year the total number of sales will be   about even with 2009.
