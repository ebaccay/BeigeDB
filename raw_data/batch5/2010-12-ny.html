      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has continued to expand since the last report,   with noticeable improvement in the labor market, while prices have remained   stable. Non-manufacturing contacts overall report steadily improving business   conditions, whereas manufacturing-sector contacts report a recent pullback in   activity; even so, respondents in both sectors indicate that they continue to   add workers, on balance, and plan to do so in the months ahead. Similarly, a   major employment agency notes some pickup in hiring activity. General   merchandise retailers report that sales have improved steadily in October and   early November, while auto dealers continue to report fairly good sales results.   Tourism activity in New York City has shown signs of picking up in recent weeks.   Consumer confidence has also moved up modestly. However, commercial and   residential real estate markets have been steady to softer since the last   report. Finally, bankers report steady loan demand, tightening credit standards,   and some increase in delinquency rates on home mortgage loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales have picked   up steadily since September: overall, sales were characterized as roughly on   plan in October and ahead of plan through early November. One major retail chain   attributed part of the recent pickup in sales to the arrival of cold weather in   November, after an unseasonably mild October. A large mall in western New York   State reports that traffic has been brisk and that customers--particularly from   Canada--have been leaving with many shopping bags. A contact at another major   mall in upstate New York notes that sales slowed in October and were down   slightly from a year earlier but picked up in the first half of November. Most   retail contacts in New York state indicate little, if any, discernible effect   from the October 1st reinstatement of the sales tax on clothing priced under   $110. Inventories are generally reported to be at favorable levels, and prices   continue to be steady, though one large chain anticipates some increase in   merchandise price pressures starting next spring. Most retail contacts indicate   that they are hiring slightly more holiday-season workers than in 2009; one   contact notes that there have been more applicants for these temporary jobs this   year. Auto dealers in the Rochester area report that sales of new autos were up   roughly 12 percent from a year ago in October and are running 5 to 10 percent   ahead in November. Low inventories are no longer a problem, because auto   production has recovered to a more normal level. Retail credit conditions have   continued to ease, and wholesale credit markets have shown steady improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity in New York City has been strong since the last report.   Manhattan hotels report that occupancy rates continued to hover around 90   percent in October and remained higher than a year ago in November; room rates   continued to edge up since the last report and were running 7 to 8 percent ahead   of a year ago. While leisure visits to New York City are described as steady and   robust, business travel has strengthened steadily. Broadway theaters report a   pickup in both attendance and total revenues in late October and early November:   after a dip in September and early October, business is, once again, running   ahead of a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer confidence, though still at low levels, has improved modestly since   the last report. The Conference Board reports that consumer confidence among   residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, PA) rose in September and   October, reversing a decline in August. Similarly, Siena College's latest survey   of New York State residents shows confidence rising to its highest level since   May both upstate and in the New York City area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing markets across the   District have been steady to softer since the last report, with some of the   ongoing weakness at the lower end of the market attributed to the mid-year   expiration of the home-buyer tax credit. In general, prices have drifted down   across much of upstate New York and in northern New Jersey since mid-year, while   prices in New York City remained relatively steady. Buffalo-area Realtors report   that the housing market weakened somewhat in October through early November,   particularly for lower-priced homes; sales activity has slowed, and the supply   of homes on the market has increased. Similarly, a contact in northern New   Jersey reports that market conditions remain sluggish: sales activity remains   low and is still largely composed of distress sales, and prices are still said   to be edging down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in New York City's co-op and condo market has slipped by a bit more   than the seasonal norm in October and early November, particularly at the lower   end of the market, though a recent flurry of activity is reported at the very   high end (homes in the range of $8 million or more). Prices remain stable across   the spectrum. While the number of new condos under construction has declined   modestly, there continues to be a substantial inventory of unsold, completed   units. Manhattan's rental market has reportedly softened a bit since the last   report. Rents remain stable, but landlords are, once again, offering concessions   (such as one or more month's free rent), though these discounts are not as steep   as in 2009. A substantial amount of new housing in the pipeline is likely to be   offered as rentals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office markets across the District have been steady to slightly softer thus   far in the fourth quarter. Asking rents held steady in Manhattan and slipped in   northern New Jersey, Long Island and Rochester but rose modestly in Westchester   and Fairfield counties and in Buffalo. Vacancy rates have been steady to   modestly higher since the last report. Sales of commercial properties remain   sluggish, and a contact in upstate New York reports that commercial construction   activity remains at depressed levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major New York City employment   agency, specializing in office jobs, reports that the job market has picked up a   bit since the last report, with some increase in hiring activity at both   financial and legal firms; other areas, such as publishing remain sluggish. The   pool of job applicants, though still large, appears to be shrinking a bit. More   broadly, non-manufacturing firms in the District report increasingly widespread   hiring activity, as well as business conditions generally; these contacts also   remain optimistic about prospects for the early part of 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the other hand, manufacturing activity has weakened, on balance, as a   number of firms saw slower activity and fewer contacts reported improvements.   Yet these contacts continue to report that they are increasing employment, on   balance, and they are increasingly optimistic about the near-term outlook. Also,   manufacturing contacts indicate that they are currently holding somewhat higher   cash balances than usual, and a sizable proportion of contacts indicate that   they plan to increase cash holdings over the next year. Both manufacturers and   other firms report moderate increases in prices paid but little or no change in   their selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small to medium-sized banks in the   District report steady loan demand across all categories, although they see some   increase in the demand for refinancing. Respondents report a tightening of   credit standards for all loan categories: the percentage of bankers reporting   tightening credit standards ranged from 11 percent for residential mortgages to   18 percent for commercial and industrial loans. No banker reported an easing of   credit standards in any of the categories. Bankers report narrowing spreads of   loan rates over costs of funds for all loan categories--most notably in the   commercial and industrial loan category. Respondents also indicate widespread   decreases in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers report rising   delinquency rates for residential mortgages but little or no change in other   categories.
