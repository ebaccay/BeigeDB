      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     Economic activity  continues to slow in the First District, with most manufacturers tallying  year-over-year revenue declines, some of which are substantial.  Both residential and commercial real estate  markets in the region saw some further deterioration in recent months, while  staffing and software firms report ongoing declines in demand. Retail results,  by contrast, are somewhat mixed. Respondents across sectors say they are  restraining compensation in multiple ways, and many firms have cut employment.  Although pressures are downward, only a few contacts indicate they are reducing  their selling prices; manufacturers say they are avoiding general price cuts  either to protect margins or because they foresee little demand responsiveness.
     <p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       First District retailers  report mixed sales results for January and early February, with same-store  sales generally ranging from low single-digit percentage increases from a year  earlier to single-digit percentage declines.   Several contacts indicate that sales were not as soft as they expected,  and a few respondents express more optimism, albeit cautious, than in previous  conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers continue to manage  inventory levels tightly and have cut 2009 capital spending plans, although a  few say they are taking advantage of expansion opportunities. Most respondents  have invoked hiring freezes and some have already reduced or are considering  reducing headcount in the near future. Several contacts have also frozen wages  or eliminated bonuses or retirement contributions, and note that employees have  taken the news of these freezes and job cuts "remarkably well."
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, First District  retailers are watchful, as they expect consumers to continue to be cautious for  the next several quarters.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing  and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most manufacturing and  related services contacts headquartered in the First District report that,  based on evidence to date, their sales in the first quarter of 2009 are likely  to come in below year-ago levels.  About  one-half of the respondents express concerns related to excess inventories or  rising receivables, representing a deterioration from the last report.  Many manufacturers indicate that revenues in  some business segments have fallen at a double-digit rate; semiconductor firms  and their suppliers say their total revenue drop has been 50 percent or  more.  By contrast with the general  trend, biopharmaceutical sales continue to grow at double-digit rates.  In addition, selected respondents outside of  the biopharmaceutical industry note that their exports of innovative products  or to some foreign markets have held up relatively well over the past  year.  Some of these exporters are seeing  signs of slowdown, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many manufacturers mention  that various commodity prices have fallen, but in general these decreases have  not been fully reflected in the cost of materials or purchased services.  Manufacturers' selling prices are under  downward pressure, prompting some to offer selected reductions.  On the whole, however, respondents express  reluctance to implement broad price cuts--either out of a concern for margins or  because they estimate that customer response would be limited under current  circumstances. Biopharmaceutical firms are implementing price increases averaging  in the single digits.
      </p>
      <p>
       About one-half of the  contacted firms have cut domestic employment and/or hours in the past three  months.  Apart from planned growth in the  biotech industry, most contacts expect to keep their U.S. headcounts stable in  2009.  About one-third of responding  manufacturers have cut employee pay rates.   Most of the remaining firms expect to increase pay in the range of 3  percent to 4 percent this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Domestic capital spending  plans for 2009 are mixed.  Some firms  intend to adopt labor-saving technologies or to expand their capacity,  particularly for research and development or for making high-technology  products.  Others are cutting their  capital expenditures, citing pressures to conserve cash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost all of the contacted  manufacturers express caution about their revenue prospects, albeit to varying  degrees.  Some firms anticipate that  their sales will be depressed throughout 2009; reasons include falling  automotive production and consumers "battening down the hatches."  Others are hoping for an improved economic  environment by the second half of the year, or expect their own company to fare  relatively well despite economic headwinds. Some respondents indicate that  their strong cash position will provide some buffer against financial stresses  in the year ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and  Information Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       While  year-over-year revenue changes reported by First District software and IT  services firms range from modest declines to increases of over 25 percent,  nearly all contacts indicate slowdowns in activity during the fourth quarter of  2008 and into the first quarter of 2009.   Respondents say clients continue to be interested in their product lines  but are financially unable or unwilling to commit to transactions.  Despite softer demand, New England software  and IT services firms have been able to maintain selling prices, although a  couple of contacts note that clients are asking for new payment plans or are  taking longer to pay.  While some firms have  reduced headcount and frozen wages, others are making selective hires and  intend to give raises in the range of 3 percent to 4 percent. Almost all  respondents indicate they are either reducing capital and technology spending  or are more cautious regarding spending; for instance, multiple contacts report  delaying the purchase of new computers, while others have substituted  videoconferences for travel.  The down  economy is affecting all contacts, with many who had previously hoped for  growth in 2009 now predicting flat revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Staffing Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Staffing contacts  in the First District report "dismal" outcomes through the end of 2008 and into  2009, with one remarking that business activity "fell off a cliff in November"  and remained slow through January.  Revenues  are flat to decreasing year-over-year, with declines in the range of 20 percent  to 50 percent.  Labor demand is  reportedly low across all industries in New England, especially in the  manufacturing sector; however, a few respondents report demand from state and  local governments for skills such as civil engineers and road maintenance  workers.  Many contacts are witnessing a  flood of labor supply, with one respondent receiving 100 resumes in an hour for  an administrative position and another reporting that 80 percent of phone calls  to his firm are from job seekers.  Some  contacts have been pressured by clients to reduce bill rates from 5 percent to  15 percent, with those reductions translating directly into decreases in pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several contacts  say they believe the New England employment picture is slightly better than the  national average, and one notes an increased willingness by candidates,  particularly those working in the Midwest's automotive industry, to relocate to  New England.  While a few respondents  cite a slight uptick in activity in February, all are concerned about the  uncertainty of the economy and many anticipate several months before a recovery  occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial  Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The commercial  real estate market showed signs of further deterioration throughout the region  in recent weeks. Contacts in Boston drew attention to the fact that rents are  falling rapidly across the metropolitan area, for both office and retail space.  One contact described a rental markdown of close to 25 percent for space in a  downtown office building, just within the last two weeks. Another Boston  contact estimates that downtown office rents are down 20 percent on average  since September 2008. Contacts also point out that, in a growing share of  cases, rental rates are not being published in property listings, a sign that  rates are negotiable. The downward pressure on rents reflects a sharp increase  in the supply of space for sublease even as official vacancy figures edged up  only slightly. Office vacancy was estimated by one contact at about 12 percent  downtown, 18 percent in close-in suburbs, and 27 percent in the outer suburban  ring.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Providence, the downtown office  market is described as stable, but sublease supply is up and downward pressure  on rents is mounting. Some retail closings were reported in Providence, and the  industrial market is "drifting lower, but not in big trouble yet." No major  changes are reported for Hartford, but deal volume is close to zero for both  leasing and sales. Office vacancy increased "marginally", but sublease supply has  doubled since December 2008. Retail vacancy has risen in the area, but not by  as much as this contact predicted earlier in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       The credit  situation is described as largely unchanged since last report. Financing  continues to flow to deals under $10M but remains scarce for deals above that  threshold and virtually non-existent for deals over $50M. The financing for the  smaller deals is coming from community and regional banks around the region  with healthy balance sheets. One Boston contact expects an increase in defaults  on large commercial properties as risky loans come to maturity in the next 12  months; he says borrowers will be unable to refinance these large deals unless  investors return to the securitization market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts expect  further deterioration in the commercial market in the coming months due to  ongoing weakness in the economy and ongoing disturbances in credit markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential  Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales and prices showed  steep declines across the New England region in December 2008 and January  2009.  Home sales in December declined  year-over-year by 6 percent in Rhode Island, 16 percent in Maine, and 20  percent in Connecticut.  In January, home  sales dropped 12.5 percent year-over-year in Massachusetts and 35 percent in  New Hampshire.  Median home prices also continued  to drop across the region.  Inventory  continues to decline in Massachusetts. By contrast, because of the low level of  sales activity, New Hampshire had almost 23 months of supply in January 2009,  up from 11 months of supply in January 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       Condo  sales dropped more than 25 percent year-over-year in Rhode Island and  Connecticut in December and in Massachusetts in January.  While home prices saw large declines  throughout 2008, condo price declines were much more modest until  recently.  In the New England states for  which they are reported, median condo prices fell 10 percent to 26 percent  year-over-year in December or January.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts  are generally optimistic regarding the tax credit included in the stimulus  package.  Even though the new $8,000  credit is still available only for new homebuyers, they are pleased that  Congress removed the payback requirement that was part of the 2008 $7,500  credit.
