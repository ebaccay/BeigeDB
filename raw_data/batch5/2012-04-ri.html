      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions have improved in the Fifth District economy since our last   report. Manufacturing activity continued to advance, although somewhat more   slowly than at the beginning of the year. While trade activity increased,   imports improved somewhat more slowly than exports. Retail sales activity rose   sharply, as shopper traffic increased and big-ticket sales strengthened.   Services-providing firms also recorded solid revenue growth in recent weeks, and   unseasonably warm weather bolstered tourism. Bankers reported modest gains in   most types of lending; however, other than refinancing, the amount of mortgage   lending remained relatively weak. Nonetheless, Realtors noted an increase in   sales of existing homes, and contractors reported an uptick in new home   construction. Commercial real estate activity also improved moderately across   most segments of the market, although contractors reported fewer   government-related new construction projects. Hiring activity picked up,   especially for temporary workers. Finally, the pace of price increases rose   marginally over the last month, according to our latest manufacturing and   service sector surveys.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity expanded moderately over the last   month. However, shipments, new orders, and employment all grew at a somewhat   slower pace since our last report, with several contacts citing the increasing   cost of petroleumâ€“based products as a major factor affecting their business. An   automotive parts manufacturer reported that customer orders remained elevated,   but he was concerned that orders and sales could weaken if recent high fuel   prices persist. A contact at a lumber mill stated that he had seen improvement   in both sales and output prices since the beginning of the year. In contrast, a   paper producer said that his firm was experiencing a significant decline in   business, adding that most of his employees were currently on a thirty hour   workweek. A textile manufacturer said that synthetic raw material prices were   "soaring," but that it was difficult to pass these increases through to   customers. According to our recent survey, prices of both raw materials and   finished goods grew at a somewhat quicker pace than a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Port activity in the District continued to strengthen since the end of last   year, with exports slightly outperforming imports. Several port authorities   reported that roll-on, roll-off stock was up. Indeed, several officials noted   that autos and automotive parts were key products boosting both imports and   exports. Exports of bulk goods, including coal, wood by-products, and   agricultural goods, continued to be robust. An executive at a large container   carrier noted that downward pressure on shipping rates persisted due to excess   capacity. Rising fuel costs were cited as causing serious problems for both land   and ocean shippers. However, most port contacts expected that exports and   imports would continue to strengthen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales strengthened markedly since our last   report. Gains were led by rising shopper traffic and an uptick in big-ticket   sales, while inventories flattened. A store manager in West Virginia remarked   that unusually warm weather had caused sporting goods sales to pick up earlier   than normal. Additionally, home improvement sales were up at most of the   merchants polled in our latest survey. A contact at a home improvement chain   noted particular strength in sales of kitchen remodeling components. Higher   gasoline prices led to freight surcharges, according to several contacts. Sales   of both domestic and foreign cars remained strong, as consumers replaced aging   vehicles and looked for better fuel-efficiency. Consumers continued to bargain   intently, with a North Carolina furniture retailer commenting that margins were   "the tightest they've ever been." A contact at a Virginia food chain remarked   that customers were purchasing more selectively, as retail prices accelerated.   However, a home appliance retailer noted that consumers absorbed significant   price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenues expanded at service-providing firms,   despite concern about the rising cost of gasoline. Contacts at   construction-related service firms reported an increased volume of business, and   sales activity picked up at several advertising firms and travel services.   Information technology firms also noted greater demand, particularly from the   healthcare industry. Stronger demand allowed some trucking firms to raise prices   to offset fuel cost increases. However, a trucking executive indicated that the   shortage of drivers remained a serious concern. A manager of a restaurant chain   in Maryland noted that people were eating out more, but area restaurants still   needed to increase their use of incentives to compete for customers. Finally, a   recent survey indicated that the pace of price change inched up at   services-providing firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Modest improvements in lending activity were   widely reported since our last assessment. Officials at several large banks   reported slow upward movement in commercial lending, particularly to small   businesses that were financing inventory and new equipment. Several community   banks around the District noted an increase in commercial lending for office and   retail space. A lending officer in Richmond reported further strength in   consumer borrowing, especially to meet home improvement and auto financing   needs. Many bankers stated that mortgage financing remained weak, with the   exception of home refinancing. However, several bankers from across the   Districted noted a slight pickup in new home loans beyond seasonal norms.   Competitive pressures among banks remained intense, putting downward pressure on   rates. Several bankers reported that they were offering easier terms to attract   new commercial borrowers. Loan quality and payment timeliness continued to   improve, according to most bank officials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity showed   promising signs of recovery since our last report. Several contacts stated that   they were beginning to see a "ray of hope" in the housing sector, and several   builders reported starting construction in areas that had not seen new building   activity for several years. For example, a source from Charlotte said that real   estate was starting to move again in his area, and another North Carolina   contact described multi-family housing activity, particularly for senior   citizens, as being "on fire" in recent months. Lower inventory of both new and   existing homes was reported in northern and central Virginia, with contacts   noting that "days on market" were down as well. Moreover, a few contacts noted   that housing prices had stabilized and, in some markets, prices were beginning   to trend upward. Some agents attributed the rise in sales price to greater buyer   traffic as a result of unseasonably warm weather. Several Realtors reported   sales of higher priced homes were faring better than other price categories. A   number of Realtors held a positive outlook for expected sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate leasing and construction activity improved across most   segments of the market since the beginning of the year. Several commercial   Realtors reported solid increases in inquiries about availability of office and   retail space, but only moderate growth in leasing of those properties. Still,   leasing rates were firming, according to agents, due to the reduction in the   number of attractive properties still on the market. Most contractors cited   moderate increases in private sector construction projects. Unusually warm   weather helped contractors finish projects ahead of schedule, but some   contractors with weak backlogs sought to spread out work in order to keep their   workforce active. In contrast, government sector projects declined dramatically,   according to several contractors, although one builder noted an increase in   demand for secondary education facilities. Both contractors and Realtors   reported that access to financing continued to be limited, and the required   paperwork was inhibiting completion of loans on a timely basis. Prices of   construction-related goods, especially petroleum-based products, cement and   drywall increased in recent months, according to contacts, with most having only   minimal success passing through any cost increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District labor markets improved   moderately in recent weeks, with several employment agencies citing strong   demand for temporary workers. The increase in overall demand was attributed to a   general strengthening in the economy and also to the opening of new companies,   coupled with a revival in activity at previously dormant companies. Several   employment agencies indicated that some of their clients remained uncertain   about future demand, however, and preferred hiring temporary workers. A   representative at a North Carolina staffing agency reported that demand for   information technology workers was much higher than supply and that the gap was   worsening. She added that schools did not have enough graduates to meet the   demand in that sector. District manufacturers increased employment more slowly   than a month ago, according to our latest survey, while wage gains picked up.   Growth in employment and wages in the broad services sector nearly matched our   last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unseasonably warm temperatures contributed to   strong tourist activity since our last report. A North Carolina contact from the   outer banks cited exceptional attendance at early spring events. While beach   house rental rates were unchanged in recent weeks, real estate rental companies   were able to remove incentives that had been included since last autumn. In   Washington, D.C., the atypical temperatures resulted in cherry blossoms peaking   at the second-earliest date ever. Tourist-related businesses were busy and   restaurants were full. This year marks the one-hundred year celebration of the   gift of the cherry trees from Japan, with numerous special events planned,   drawing a significantly higher volume of foreign visitors than normal. A contact   described the crowds as "wall-to-wall humanity."
