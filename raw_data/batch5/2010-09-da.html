      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Eleventh District economy expanded modestly over the past six weeks. The   energy sector remained a source of strength, and agriculture, transportation   services and staffing firms reported solid growth. Retailers said sales rose,   but the pace of growth was slower. Reports from the manufacturing sector were   mixed, but overall suggest a slowdown. In particular, construction-related   manufacturers said demand was very weak as housing demand has retrenched and   private nonresidential activity is almost nonexistent. Most respondents expect   economic conditions to remain positive, although many expect slower growth   through year-end. Uncertainty was prevalent in most outlooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Selling prices held steady at most responding   firms. Retailers said prices were flat and airline fares stabilized after   increases earlier in the year. Contacts across industries said pricing was   extremely competitive. There were, however, scattered reports of price increases   in a few industries. Paper producers and aircraft manufacturers said they were   able to pass on increased input costs. Additionally, prices for some   petrochemical products rose slightly. Some staffing firms were attempting to   raise fees due to strong demand. Contacts in the agricultural industry said   commodity prices had moved up recently. Cotton prices are up nearly 50 percent   over last year and cattle prices have risen strongly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crude oil prices fell below $73 per barrel by late August after a run up to   $82 earlier in the month. The price of gasoline, diesel and heating oil fell   during the reporting period, as inventories rose due to weak demand. Contacts   said natural gas prices edged down to just under $4 per Mcf by late August as   the national heat-wave subsided.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Market
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Employment levels were stable at most firms,   and the overall labor market remained somewhat slack. Some contacts in the   lumber and trailer manufacturing industries reported layoffs. On a more positive   note, there were scattered reports of hiring activity. Staffing firms cited   continued increases in placement activity, and a few contacts in transportation   services, legal services, automobile sales, and transportation manufacturing   said they had added workers. Wage pressures were generally nonexistent, with   exceptions found in the airline industry and for some temporary workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most producers of construction-related   materials--including brick, lumber, cement, glass and primary and fabricated   metals--said conditions remained weak. Several respondents tied to housing   construction said orders were especially low in July because of the vacuum   created by the end of the tax credit. Contacts that produce products used in   nonresidential construction noted most activity was related to public projects.   Outlooks were slightly more pessimistic than in the last report, with several   contacts expecting no turnaround until 2012. A primary metals producer that   sells to transportation manufacturers was more upbeat and expects increased   orders in coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers of high-tech products said demand held steady over the past six   weeks. Growth in orders has leveled off in recent months after a replenishment   of inventories earlier in the year that drove very strong growth. Most   respondents characterize current order levels as good. Although inventories have   increased, respondents said they are relatively lean and in some cases below   desired levels. Several semiconductor contacts said that industry-wide capacity   has fallen about 30 percent over the past three years and, even with growing   capital expenditures, capacity utilization is likely to remain very high for the   next two to three years. Outlooks were positive for the remainder of the   year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paper manufacturers reported flat to declining sales over the past six weeks.   Contacts said customers are very cautious about keeping inventories, due to   pessimistic economic outlooks. Growth in demand for food products stalled since   the last report. Respondents said they did not see the normal summer boost this   year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Non-defense aircraft manufacturers said orders held steady over the past six   weeks and are above year-ago levels. Outlooks were cautiously optimistic.   Trailer producers said demand had fallen as uncertainty about the national   economy increased. Sales are expected to be slow through year-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petrochemical producers were mostly optimistic, noting domestic orders were   strong and growing. Export growth was positive but slower, as current prices   were less competitive in Europe and Asia. The only reported weakness was for   vinyl products used in housing and commercial construction. Refiners noted   weaker conditions as seasonal gains in gasoline consumption did not materialize   and distillate (diesel and heating oil) consumption slipped back. Contacts   expect a decline in capacity utilization rates and refining runs due to weaker   margins.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers noted that growth has slowed recently,   but sales are up on a year-over-year basis. Customers continue to focus on   non-discretionary items while shunning big-ticket purchases. Eleventh District   sales trended slightly above the nation over the reporting period, a change from   the previous report. Outlooks suggest that while sales growth may be slower for   the remainder of the year; overall 2010 sales should show positive single-digit   growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobile demand held steady over the reporting period. Contacts said   inventories are at appropriate levels and manufacturers are incrementally   increasing production. Expectations are for continued modest improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most staffing firms report that demand continues   to grow at a solid pace, and is particularly strong for light industrial, sales,   administrative, professional and technical workers. Placement activity continues   to be mostly for contract work as employers are still hesitant to hire permanent   staff. Near-term outlooks are optimistic, but respondents are cautious about the   longer term. Accounting firms note that while demand for tax-related services   has slowed seasonally and that for real estate and construction-related work   remains nonexistent, there has been a pickup in transactional and consulting   activity. Demand for legal services was largely unchanged during the reporting   period, with the exception of an uptick in corporate demand for mergers and   acquisitions-related activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for transportation services remains positive. Railroad respondents   noted a broad-based increase in cargo volumes, with shipments of grain products   recording the largest increase. Shipping firms said small parcel cargo volumes   rose, while large freight shipments declined during the reporting period.   Intermodal transportation firms reported a modest increase in shipments. Airline   traffic was flat to slightly down since the last report, but is stronger than a   year ago. The outlook is for continued stability in air travel demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales continued to   slide since the last report. Contacts noted demand was especially weak in the   lower-priced segment of the market which had benefitted most from the homebuyer   tax credits. Construction of new homes fell as large public builders scaled   back. Outlooks are guarded for the rest of the year. Sales and construction are   expected to remain weak, as the tax credit affected the timing of purchase   decisions.
      </p>
      Contacts in the office and industrial real estate sectors said   leasing activity remained subdued. Investor interest in nonresidential   properties remains high however, and contacts say sales continue to edge up.
      <p>
       Nonresidential construction remains weak. Contacts reported a notable lack of   private nonresidential projects. Public construction is the main source of   activity for most contacts, but some expressed concern that such projects would   subside due to budget constraints.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Financial firms said loan demand   continued to trail off. Business lending was especially weak, and contacts said   businesses lacked confidence and were unwilling to make financial commitments.   Deposit growth was strong, and credit quality on outstanding loans was stable.   Several respondents reported concerns over financial reform legislation and   other political uncertainties. Earnings projections are flat for 2011, and some   contacts were building up loan loss reserves in preparation for the coming   year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Drilling activity in the Eleventh District rose   since the last report. The Permian Basin in Texas led the increase, as activity   continues to be directed to land-based oil. Drilling service companies noted   solid demand and improved margins. Contacts noted that the deep water drilling   moratorium will impact revenues, but strong domestic land and international   activity is mitigating the impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hot, dry weather reduced soil moisture in   most of the District, but drought conditions are minimal. Respondents said crop   conditions remain very strong, and yields for harvested crops are above average.   A record cotton crop is expected for Texas this year. Demand for U.S.   agricultural products has picked up in the wake of the devastating flood in   Pakistan and drought in Russia, and most commodity prices have moved up as a   result.
