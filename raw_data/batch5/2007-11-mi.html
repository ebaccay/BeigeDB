      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the  last report. Growth was noted in consumer spending, tourism, services,  commercial construction and real estate, manufacturing, energy, mining and  agriculture. Residential construction and real estate continued to weaken.  Employment was mixed, with tight conditions in the western part of the District  and loosening in the east. Overall wage increases were moderate, while significant price increases were noted for  fuel, fertilizer, food, steel and copper products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer  Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased modestly. A major Minneapolis-based  retailer reported that same-store sales increased about 4 percent in October  compared with a year earlier. Traffic was relatively slow in October at a  Minneapolis-area mall, but grew in early November. Store managers were  optimistic for the holiday season, and some were running early promotions.  Retail sales at a mall in Fargo, N.D., were well above year-ago  levels during the past two months, according to the manager, who also noted  increased Canadian traffic because of the stronger Canadian dollar. However,  according to preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's annual business  outlook poll (November), 48 percent of respondents expect consumer spending to  decrease in their communities during 2008, while 12 percent expect increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      An auto dealer in Montana noted that recent demand  for smaller cars is increasing and that overall car sales are ahead of last  year. Car sales softened during October and early  November, according to a representative of a Minnesota auto dealers  association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fall tourism was up, and officials were optimistic for the winter season.  Tourism and convention business was strong during October in Duluth, Minn., according to an official;  inventory, occupancy and rates were up. According to a chamber of commerce  representative in northwestern Wisconsin, overall tourism-related  traffic was good and businesses were optimistic for the winter season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts from professional  business service firms were upbeat. Based on preliminary results from the  Minneapolis Fed's outlook poll, respondents from the service sector expect  strong growth in their company sales, employment and capital investment in  2008. Contacts at legal firms reported robust billings in several sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and  Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction activity was up slightly. A  bank director noted that Minnesota builders were busy with  industrial and large commercial projects, but that activity in smaller  commercial projects was slowing. Construction began on the replacement span for  the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis. A large medical provider  announced plans to expand its headquarters in the St. Paul suburbs by 175,000 square  feet. Meanwhile, residential construction continued at a slower pace. In  Minneapolis-St. Paul, housing units authorized dropped 28 percent in October  from the previous year. Six planned condominium developments in downtown Minneapolis have been stalled or  cancelled in recent months. However, October new housing permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., increased from the  previous year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial  real estate saw steady growth. A Minneapolis commercial real estate firm  noted that the industrial market saw positive absorption in the third quarter  with an increase in lease rates and that leasing was brisk for office space.  However, retail real estate was soft. The residential real estate market  continued to decline. October home prices per square foot fell 4.4 percent from  the previous year, with condominium space down almost 6 percent. However, rents  increased and the rental vacancy rate decreased during the third quarter in  Minneapolis-St. Paul. Realtors in Sioux Falls said the market there was  robust. In western Montana, demand for housing was  still strong.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing sector  grew since the last report. Based on preliminary results from the Minneapolis  Fed's outlook poll, respondents from the manufacturing sector expect growth in  company sales, employment and capital investment in 2008. In addition,  preliminary results from a survey of District manufacturers conducted in early  November by the Minneapolis Fed and the Minnesota Department of Employment and  Economic Development show that businesses expect production, productivity and  investment to increase in 2008 from a solid 2007. Several respondents from the  aforementioned surveys indicated that strong exports are driving sales.  Meanwhile, an October survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated increased  manufacturing activity in Minnesota and the Dakotas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since  the last report. Oil and gas exploration and production in the District  continued at a solid pace. Numerous wind energy projects are under  construction, while some proposed ethanol projects were put on hold. Most mines  continued to operate at near capacity. High metal prices induced permitting for  new mines and expansion of several existing operations.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Robust agricultural conditions were  reported across the District. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's  third quarter (October) survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated that  lenders expect overall agricultural income and spending to be up in the fourth  quarter of 2007 due to higher selling prices and decent yields, but are  cautious about higher input costs affecting next year's profits. The strong  fall harvest is nearly complete for all major District crops; winter wheat has  started to emerge and is in good condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment,  Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment was mixed with tight conditions in the  western part of the District and loosening in the east. Based on preliminary  results of the Minneapolis Fed's outlook poll, 34 percent of respondents plan  to increase employment over the next year, while 21 percent expect to decrease  employment. Retailers in Sioux Falls were having difficulty  hiring enough seasonal workers because of the area's low rate of unemployment.  One retailer noted a decrease in retention as workers search for better pay or  benefits at other locations. In northwestern Montana, businesses are advertising  and offering more benefits to attract workers than in the past.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, Minnesota employment levels were down  6,600 jobs in October from September and were only slightly above last year's  levels. A residential real estate lender recently announced plans to cut 460  jobs in Minnesota, while a producer of air  conditioning and heating equipment plans to lay off up to 145 workers in  southwestern Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall wage increases were moderate. The preliminary  results of the Minneapolis Fed's outlook poll showed that 87 percent of  respondents expect wages and salaries to increase no more than 3 percent at  businesses in their communities during 2008.
     </p>
     <p>
      While overall price increases were  moderate, significant increases were noted for fuel, fertilizer, food, steel  and copper products. Minnesota gasoline prices in early November  were about 85 cents a gallon higher than a year ago, while Midwest diesel prices were about 80 cents  higher. A Montana bank director noted that fertilizer and a number of food  prices have increased over the past three months. Some steel and copper product  prices recently rose.
