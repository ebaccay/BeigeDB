      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the Federal Reserve    Districts indicate that economic activity has continued to expand.  St. Louis and Kansas City described the    pace of activity as moderate; Cleveland, Chicago and Minneapolis said their    economies were expanding at a modest rate; and Boston and Atlanta reported    that activity was mixed.  New York    cited continued expansion.  The    economies in Philadelphia, Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco continued to    grow; however, the pace of activity has slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Banks reported that the recent    developments in financial markets had led to tighter lending standards for    residential mortgages, which was having a noticeable effect on housing    activity, and several noted that the reduction in credit availability added    to uncertainty about when the housing market might turn around. While several    Banks noted that commercial real estate markets had also experienced somewhat    tighter credit conditions, a number commented that credit availability and    credit quality remained good for most consumer and business borrowers.  Outside of real estate, reports that the    turmoil in financial markets had affected economic activity during the survey    period were limited.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales were generally positive,    with increases characterized as modest to moderate.  However, several Districts described motor    vehicle and furniture sales as slow.     Manufacturing activity expanded across most Districts, with reports of    softening demand for building materials and autos.  The weakness in the housing market deepened    across most Districts, with sales weak or declining and prices reported to be    falling or flat.  Most Districts    reported a continuing contraction in the residential mortgage market.    Commercial real estate activity was generally stable to expanding.  Demand for business loans held steady or    weakened, while consumer lending was mixed.     Agricultural conditions varied widely across Districts, with several    reporting damage to crops and pastures as a result of excessive heat and    drought conditions. Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained    positive in all of the Districts reporting on these sectors.  Nearly every District reported at least    modest increases in employment during the recent survey period.  Most Districts characterized their wage    increases as moderate or steady. Wage pressures were intense only in isolated    professions in short supply.  And most    Districts reported little change in overall price pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Districts generally reported modest to    moderate increases in sales, although Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco    described retail sales as mixed.     Dallas reported little change in consumer spending growth.  Richmond reported that retail sales posted    modest gains in July but pulled back sharply in    August.  New York, on the other hand,    described July sales as somewhat below plan, but August sales as ahead of    plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Furniture sales declined in    Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis, and San Francisco while Boston experienced    stronger sales. Merchants in New York and Chicago reported a slight pickup in    sales of home furnishings.  Retailers    in Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Kansas City noted solid-to-strong    back-to-school sales. However, Chicago and Dallas reported difficulty    comparing back-to-school shopping with last year because of school-year    timing.  Boston and Kansas City    reported strong sales of apparel items while New York and St. Louis    experienced mixed results.  Some    weakening in apparel sales was seen in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and    Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle sales were described as slow or subdued in    many Districts.  Cleveland, Richmond,    Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco, all reported sluggish    new vehicle sales.  In contrast, auto    dealers reported that sales increased modestly in Kansas City and picked up    slightly in Philadelphia.  Cleveland    and San Francisco noted strength in used vehicle sales.  Many auto dealers reported anxiety about    future sales due to tighter household credit conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Districts that commented on retail inventory levels    generally described them as at or above desired levels. Several retailers    reported that they planned to or had already heavily discounted merchandise    to move inventory.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports on tourism were positive,    with the New York, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City Districts reporting    particularly solid growth in tourist spending.  Minneapolis cited dry, warm weather for    helping the tourism industry.  Two    Districts were less positive on tourism:     San Francisco experienced slowing tourist activity and Chicago    described a pessimistic outlook for the rest of the year despite a slight    pickup in some parts of the District in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports on the service industry were    generally neutral to positive.  Several    Districts posted strong gains in financial services, health care, information    technology, and technical and professional services. Demand for legal    services was stable or showed modest increases.  Demand for transportation services showed    signs of softening--Atlanta and Dallas reported decreased activity while    Cleveland and Chicago cited no change.     Reports from Boston, Richmond, Minneapolis, and Dallas indicated that    the recent volatility in financial markets may slow down the pace of business    activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most Districts reported that    manufacturing activity expanded during late July and early August.  New York, Richmond, Minneapolis, and San    Francisco indicated solid growth.     Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis stated that manufacturing    expanded but at a slower pace.     Manufacturing was stable to increasing slightly in Cleveland, Kansas    City, and Dallas, but was described as mixed in Boston and Atlanta.
     </p>
     <p>
      The automobile and building materials    industries showed weakness across most reporting Districts. Cleveland,    Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas all indicated that the auto sector had softened,    though one report suggested that some of the reduction in production was    related to model changeovers.  Six    Districts said that industries related to housing experienced weakness,    including building materials and construction equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industries showing improved conditions    varied markedly across Districts.     High-technology manufacturing was strong in the Kansas City and San    Francisco regions and showed steady growth in the Dallas District.  A number of Districts reported steady to    solid growth in aircraft and electrical equipment production and strength in    exports.  Chicago noted that some steel    producers have started exporting steel regularly for the first time.  Most Districts indicated that input price    pressures held steady or rose modestly compared to the previous report.  Expenditures for plant and equipment    remained close to plan in Boston and Cleveland.  Contacts in San Francisco reported that    productivity improvements continued on trend in 2007.  Looking forward, contacts in New York,    Philadelphia, Richmond, and Kansas City expressed near-term optimism about    business conditions in their sectors; reports from Cleveland and Dallas were    somewhat more cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate and construction weakened further in most    Districts while the commercial market remained steady.  Most Districts reported weak or declining    residential sales and declining or stable prices.  Markets in a few Districts did show some    strength.  Both sales and prices have    been increasing in the Massachusetts housing market; the New York City    apartment market remains tight as rents rise; and home sales rose in    Louisville.  Inventories of unsold    homes are generally reported to be high.     Moreover, contacts in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta,    Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas believe softness in the market will continue    in the near future, with potential for further declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial    real estate and construction markets were generally stable to expanding    across the Districts. Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated    continued expansion in nonresidential construction and commercial real    estate.  Dallas described the level of    nonresidential activity as high, and St. Louis said commercial construction    remained strong.  New York, Cleveland,    Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City indicated commercial construction    and real estate markets were steady or stable. Vacancy rates are reported to    be low or declining in most Districts, and rents are rising modestly in    many.  Boston, New York, Richmond,    Chicago, Kansas City, and Dallas noted some tightening of credit in the    commercial real estate market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The demand for residential mortgages continued a    downward trend in most Districts. Consumer lending softened in New York,    Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas, while St. Louis reported stable    activity.  In Philadelphia, personal loans    increased on credit card lending. Looking forward,    lenders in Dallas do not expect any further deterioration in consumer lending    after the softening that was reported earlier in the year.  Bankers in Philadelphia continue to see    growth in personal lending over the next few quarters, albeit at a slower    rate than in the first half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      More than half of the Districts reported    a tightening in credit standards.     Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and Dallas mentioned    tightening for both residential mortgages and business loans, while financial    institutions in Atlanta and San Francisco said tighter standards were aimed    primarily at home mortgage products.     Delinquencies in consumer loans and mortgages rose slightly in    Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis, while New York reported no change    in delinquencies across all loan categories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business loans was steady or    weakening in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis, while Philadelphia    reported an increase in demand.  Commercial real estate lending increased in    Kansas City and was quite strong in San Francisco, where "some banks    reportedly are approaching regulatory limits on loan concentrations for this    segment."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural conditions varied across    Districts.  High temperatures and    drought conditions resulted in damage to crops and pastures in the Richmond,    Atlanta, Chicago, and St. Louis Districts. According to some estimates, the    drought could cost Georgia and Florida farmers over $2 billion in lost production.  Nevertheless, a report from Chicago    indicated that even with unfavorable weather, the District was poised for a    record corn harvest because farmers had planted more corn at the expense of    soybeans. In the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, favorable summer rains    boosted pasture growth and livestock conditions.  Rains in the Kansas City District resulted    in above-average wheat yields and improved growing conditions for corn and    soybeans, which placed some downward pressure on crop prices. Further,    livestock prices remained solid, although rising production costs trimmed    margins for hog producers and cattle feedlot operators.  In the San Francisco District, demand for    agricultural products continued to grow, and supply conditions were largely    favorable.  Some agricultural contacts    reported that pressures on input costs eased overall, but others noted that    prices of feed grain increased further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Activity in the energy and mining sectors remained    positive as increases were observed in all Districts reporting on these    developments.  In Dallas, energy    activity remained robust--domestic drilling has flattened out, while    international drilling is growing and remained the primary source of strength    for service companies.  Kansas City reported    stable drilling activity and expected increased activity heading    forward.  Cleveland's oil and gas    producers reported production levels were flat to increasing slightly since    mid-July.  Both Cleveland and Kansas    City cite the lack of qualified labor as a continuing strain on    expansion.  In the Minneapolis    District, activity increased since the previous    report, with mining production remaining at near capacity.  The Atlanta District reported that    Hurricane Dean did not have a significant impact on energy production along    the Louisiana coast.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Nearly every District reported at least    modest increases in employment during the recent survey period.  The lone exception was Chicago, which,    instead, characterized employment conditions as mixed.  Philadelphia and San Francisco made no    statement characterizing overall changes in District employment.  New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis,    and Dallas described their labor markets as tight.  Nine of the twelve Districts reported that    there were shortages of some skilled workers, including those in the    information technology, accountancy, legal, and health care professions. In    addition, Kansas City noted shortages for workers with lower skills, such as    housekeepers and waiters, while San Francisco reported that agricultural    workers were in increasingly short supply.     Staffing services firms reported more demand for temporary workers in    several Districts (Boston, Richmond, and Dallas), but less demand in    Cleveland.  Several Districts reported    declines in construction employment, though the San Francisco District    reported that, in some areas, rising commercial construction has helped keep    overall construction employment stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Though some Districts described    employment condition as tight, most reported that wage increases were    moderate or steady.  Wage pressures    were intense only in isolated professions in short supply. Several Districts    also noted that costs of health care benefits continued to post large    increases, although they were not accelerating.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported little change in    overall price pressures.  There was    downward pressure on residential real estate prices across nearly all    Districts. Three Districts--Boston, Philadelphia, and Dallas--reported lower    lumber prices, while Atlanta reported that these prices stabilized.  Three Districts noted discounting among    retailers during the back-to-school selling season (New York, Philadelphia,    and Dallas), while two others reported overall declines in retailers' prices    (Richmond and Kansas City). However, higher food costs continued to be widely    reported and were said to be putting upward pressure on grocery and    restaurant prices.
