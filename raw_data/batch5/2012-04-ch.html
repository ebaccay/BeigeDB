      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate pace   in late February and March. Growth in consumer spending picked up, and business   spending continued to increase. The pace of growth in manufacturing production   was little changed and construction activity increased. Credit conditions   improved slightly. Energy prices increased, but with limited pass-through to   downstream prices, and wage increases remained moderate. Soybean and cattle   prices rose, while corn, wheat, milk, and hog prices decreased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased   significantly in late February and March. Retailers reported unseasonably warm   temperatures boosted retail sales. Because of the earlier-than-normal start to   the spring shopping season, inventories of some lawn &amp; garden, home   improvement, and leisure items ended the reporting period on the lean side.   Several contacts thought that the recent gains in consumer spending might   dissipate over the medium-term, pointing to the temporary nature of the boost   from warmer weather and concerns about the impact of higher gasoline prices on   consumer budgets. Auto sales increased, with contacts noting improved   availability of financing for prospective buyers with below-prime credit   ratings. Dealerships continued to report some difficulty in stocking popular   models because of supply-chain constraints.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending continued to increase   in late February and March. Contacts reported that
      <strong>
      </strong>
      inventories   were generally at comfortable levels, with the exceptions in auto and consumer   goods noted above. Capital spending increased steadily. Purchases of heavy   equipment picked up, led by robust activity in the energy sector. An exception   was the coal mining industry which a contact noted was being negatively impacted   by mild weather and the cheaper extraction costs for natural gas. Several   manufacturers reported spending for technological upgrades as well as moving   ahead with planned increases in capacity. Contacts also noted a pick-up in   building renovation and increased spending on marketing and for labor force   training. Labor market conditions continued to improve. Hiring increased,   although it remained selective in many industries. Manufacturing contacts   continued to report difficulty in attracting job applicants with ideal skill   sets, and in some cases have reduced experience requirements or increased   salaries to fill open positions. A staffing firm reported an increase in demand   for light industrial, office and clerical, and IT and engineering positions.   However, gains in these areas were being offset by declines in others, so that   on net temporary employment was little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity   increased in late February and March. Demand continued to be strong for   multi-family construction, particularly apartments. That said, a few contacts   questioned whether current apartment building plans would lead to overbuilding   in this segment. Overall, residential real estate conditions improved slightly.   Single-family construction was up some from its depressed levels, as large   homebuilders have seen a solid increase in sales in the last three months.   Realtors noted some increase in activity in the market for existing homes,   although many buyers are still waiting for prices to come down further.   Foreclosures continued to put downward pressure on prices. Nonresidential   construction also increased. Contacts noted a pick-up in industrial, healthcare   and infrastructure building activity. Commercial real estate conditions were   mixed by segment. Vacancy rates decreased for office and industrial properties,   but contacts indicated that excess retail space continues to exist, especially   big box stores and strip center/mall space. Commercial rents were flat, as was   the available sublease space on the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After a strong start to the year, growth in   manufacturing production leveled off in late February and March. With an   increase in quoting activity and deepening order books, contacts remained   cautiously optimistic that growth would pick up again in the coming quarters.   The auto industry continued to be a source of strength. Automakers expected   sales to continue to increase over the year, but voiced concern that it would be   challenging for production to rise much further above what is already planned   given the capacity constraints faced by their suppliers. Confirming this   production limit, several auto suppliers reported that they have already been   asked by their customers to increase capacity. Capacity utilization in the steel   industry was steady, but an industry contact expected to see some acceleration   in production in the near term. Demand for heavy equipment was boosted by the   need to replace ageing equipment. Exporters continued to benefit from   advantageous terms of trade; and despite some softening in demand from Western   Europe, again reported robust orders from Asia and Latin America.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions were slightly   improved from the prior reporting period. Volatility and risk premia edged lower   and concerns about European sovereign debt continued to subside. Several   contacts noted an increase in risk appetite, pointing to higher demand for   equities and real estate. Banking contacts indicated that business loan growth   remained moderate, with their larger corporate clients continuing to cite policy   uncertainty as a reason for caution in borrowing. In contrast, consumer loan   growth picked up, with credit card usage increasing. Credit availability for   households improved, particularly for auto loans and credit cards, where greater   competition was leading to more favorable terms for borrowers. However, credit   conditions remained tight for homebuilders and small businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cost pressures increased in late   February and March. Contacts noted higher energy prices, particularly for   gasoline, although natural gas prices remained at historic lows. Prices for   chemicals, steel, and non-ferrous metals also edged up. Wholesale prices   increased; however, retail contacts indicated that it had become increasingly   difficult to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers. Wage pressures   increased, but continued to be moderate. Contacts expected that wage and benefit   increases this year would not exceed inflation. However, a shortage of skilled   manufacturing workers contributed to upward pressure on wages to attract   qualified candidates as well as improved benefit packages to retain current   employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Unseasonably warm weather has jumpstarted   field work and corn planting in the District. There were reports of tight   supplies of some agricultural chemicals, as well as some types of corn seed.   Most of the District has sufficient moisture for a strong start to the corn   crop. With spring planting taking place up to a month early, some corn will be   harvested in August; combined with the potential of a record corn crop, concerns   about corn stocks being low before the traditional harvest time diminished and   corn prices moved lower. Soybean prices have risen in response to   lower-than-expected harvests in South America. The increase in soybean prices   relative to corn prices, as well as some acreage being removed from   environmental protection restrictions, resulted in an increase in the number of   acres that famers expect to plant in soybeans. Milk and hog prices decreased,   while cattle prices continued to rise.
