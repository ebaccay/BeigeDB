      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace in July and   early August. Retailers and auto dealers reported higher sales and expected   increased activity in the months ahead. Manufacturing activity expanded   slightly, with additional gains expected over the next six months.   Transportation activity grew moderately, while sales in the high-tech services   sector declined slightly. Residential and commercial real estate markets   continued to improve with increased sales, construction, and prices. Banking   contacts reported slightly higher loan demand and improved loan quality.   Agricultural conditions deteriorated under extreme drought conditions leading to   higher crop prices and strained profit margins for livestock producers. The   energy sector held steady as growth in crude oil drilling continued to offset   the decrease in drilling for natural gas. Most sectors reported higher input   prices, but final goods prices and wage pressures remained stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Consumer spending continued to increase   in July and early August and was expected to rise further over the next three   months. Retailers reported higher sales, though gains were a bit less than   expected. Home furnishings, clothing and back-to-school items sold well, while   sales of high-end jewelry were weaker. Auto sales increased sharply as more   incentives were offered and access to credit improved slightly. Demand for small   and mid-sized crossovers, SUVs and cars was strong, while demand for larger SUVs   and minivans remained weak. Most auto dealers expected sales to strengthen   further in the months ahead. Restaurant sales increased, and several contacts   expected higher menu prices in coming months in response to rising food costs.   After strong gains in June, hotel occupancy fell slightly in July and early   August, but average room rates continued to rise. In terms of tourism, the   number of visitors at local attractions grew slightly, and modest gains were   expected in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Transportation   activity continued to grow moderately, manufacturing activity expanded slightly,   and sales at high-tech services firms declined slightly. Transportation activity   continued to rise, with an increase in sales and backlog activity. Input prices   and prices charged for transportation services increased with higher fuel costs.   Capital spending plans at transportation firms remained largely unchanged, with   firms continuing to expect a modest increase in capital spending in coming   months. Manufacturing production and hiring rose modestly, though the volume of   new orders, volume of shipments, and backlogs declined since the last survey.   Manufacturers expected activity to expand in coming months. Sales at high-tech   services firms decreased slightly, and capital spending grew modestly. High-tech   contacts expected improved sales in the months ahead and a strong rise in   capital spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential and commercial   real estate activity continued to improve in July and early August, and   construction activity strengthened. Residential home sales and prices rose, and   home inventories fell. Contacts reported multiple offers on homes and expected   continued housing market improvements in coming months. Homes under $300,000   sold particularly well, while homes priced over $500,000 and condos were slow to   sell in some markets. Several contacts reported that a large inventory of homes   in foreclosure has been held back and could put downward pressure on prices when   the homes come onto the market. Builders reported an increase in housing starts   and a rise in new home prices as well as improvement in the traffic of potential   buyers. Land prices and the cost of building materials rose during the survey   period as demand improved. Commercial real estate conditions also improved.   Construction and sales of commercial real estate properties rose, real estate   prices and rents increased, and vacancy rates continued to fall. Several   commercial real estate contacts expected uncertainty surrounding the   presidential election to slow activity until late in the year. Developers   reported that access to credit remained unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      In the recent survey period, bankers generally   reported slightly stronger loan demand, improving loan quality, and little   change in deposits. Overall loan demand improved slightly as most respondents   reported stable loan demand for commercial and industrial loans, commercial real   estate loans, and consumer installment loans, while demand for residential real   estate loans improved. Credit standards remained largely unchanged in all major   loan categories, and the majority of respondents reported stable deposits. The   majority of bankers reported improved loan quality compared to a year ago, and   nearly all banks expected loan quality over the next six months to remain steady   or improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Agricultural conditions deteriorated as crops   withered under extreme drought. The majority of the corn and soybean crops were   rated in fair or poor condition, cutting production estimates and sending crop   prices to record highs. Drought strained profit margins for livestock producers   as feed costs rose and further herd liquidations dampened cattle prices.   Escalating production costs were expected to boost farm loan demand in the   coming months. Agricultural bankers indicated ample funds were available for   farm loans at historically low interest rates. Loan repayment rates were   expected to hold near year-ago levels due in large part to crop insurance and   higher land lease revenues for mineral rights. While still well above year-ago   levels, farmland values rose less rapidly and were expected to hold steady   during the rest of the growing season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District energy activity remained fairly stable at   high levels in July and early August. Drilling activity rose as growth in the   number of active crude oil rigs offset declines in natural gas drilling. Most   contacts expected drilling activity to slow in coming months due to local and   national regulatory obstacles and low natural gas prices. Stable demand growth   and ample supply of crude oil were expected to limit further increases in crude   oil prices in coming months. Contacts expected the slowdown in natural gas   drilling to put upward pressure on natural gas prices over the next three   months. Shortages were reported for equipment and labor, particularly for oil   and natural gas operators and drilling engineers. Several contacts also reported   that the drought has affected drilling operations by limiting water availability   needed for hydraulic fracturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Finished goods prices remained stable   despite an increase in raw material prices, and wage pressures remained low.   Manufacturers reported higher raw material prices, and finished goods prices   remained flat. However, both raw material prices and finished goods prices were   expected to increase over the next six months in the manufacturing sector,   especially for food manufacturers. Retail prices increased slightly, and   additional price increases were expected to remain modest. Restaurant menu   prices remained flat, but many contacts expected to raise prices in the months   ahead in response to higher food costs. Builders and construction supply firms   also reported higher prices, especially for roofing materials, lumber and   concrete. Wage pressures remained subdued, and only a few contacts expected to   raise wages more than normal to attract or retain workers. However, many firms   continued to report some difficulty filling skilled positions including drivers,   technicians, engineers, computer programmers, and sales representatives.
