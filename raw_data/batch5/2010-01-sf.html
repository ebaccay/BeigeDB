      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District appeared to pick up slightly during   the reporting period of December through the beginning of January. Upward   pressures on prices were quite modest, and upward pressures on wages were   virtually nonexistent, despite sustained productivity gains in some sectors.   Holiday season retail sales were up from the preceding year but were slow   compared with prior years, while demand for services remained weak on net.   Manufacturing activity continued at very low levels for some product lines but   appeared to improve further on balance. Agricultural producers reported solid   sales, while demand was mixed for providers of energy resources. Conditions in   housing markets appeared to be largely stable, but demand for commercial real   estate continued to deteriorate. Contacts from financial institutions reported   mostly stable loan demand and further declines in credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures were quite   limited during the reporting period. Commodity prices in general were stable,   although contacts noted increases for selected commodities such as natural gas,   aluminum, and zinc. Substantial discounting continued to hold down final prices   for a variety of retail items, and persistently weak demand further reduced the   prices for various services, notably lodging and professional services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were largely absent, as compensation gains were held   down by high unemployment and limited hiring in most sectors and regions. The   majority of contacts expect that the pace of productivity improvements achieved   in their respective industries over the past year will continue in 2010; they   therefore expect hiring to remain subdued for a prolonged period, even if   product demand improves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales improved modestly   but remained somewhat weak on net. Discount chains and traditional department   stores alike reported that holiday season sales were up slightly compared with   2008, although contacts in general cautioned that sales were still well below   the levels recorded in 2007 and prior years. Consumers continued to emphasize   necessities and lower-priced options for many types of consumer goods. However,   further demand improvements were noted for some nonessential and higher-priced   items, including furniture and household appliances. Sales of new automobiles   remained very weak overall, although improvements in demand were noted for   larger vehicles such as SUVs. Sales of used automobiles strengthened, reportedly   spurred in part by price declines arising from increased supplies of formerly   leased or rented vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for services continued to be weak overall. Sales slid further for   providers of professional services, notably advertising and accounting, and   providers of real estate services such as title insurance reported that activity   was largely stable at low levels. By contrast, providers of health-care services   reported improved demand and increased patient volumes during the reporting   period. Travel and tourism activity in the District was mixed: contacts in   Southern California and Seattle noted that occupancy rates were down, while   contacts in Hawaii and Las Vegas pointed to further improvements in visitor   volumes. Activity was especially sluggish in the business travel segment of the   market, which continued to place downward pressure on airline passenger volumes   and traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity was mixed   but showed modest improvement on net during the reporting period of December   through the beginning of January. Manufacturers of semiconductors reported   further strengthening in demand, with rising sales and balanced inventories   noted. Makers of commercial aircraft and parts saw limited new orders, but an   existing order backlog combined with a decline in delivery deferrals kept   production activity largely stable at moderate levels. By contrast, production   activity remained at extremely low levels for metal fabricators, for whom demand   has been very weak for an extended period. Manufacturers of housing products   such as windows and doors also reported that new orders remained very low,   causing them to keep inventories unusually lean. Similarly, production activity   at petroleum refineries remained well below the five-year average as producers   attempted to reduce excess inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for   agricultural products was solid, with further sales gains noted, while demand   was mixed for extractors of natural resources used for energy production. Sales   expanded for assorted crops, and inputs remained readily available with   generally stable prices noted. The lower exchange value of the dollar caused   overall demand and prices to rise for selected commodities with extensive   overseas markets, such as cotton. Oil extraction activity remained at low levels   as the price of oil slid a bit. By contrast, demand for natural gas rose in   response to the onset of cold winter weather in much of the District, prompting   reactivation of some dormant wells.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for housing appeared   to be largely stable, while demand for commercial real estate eroded further.   After accounting for normal seasonal variation, the pace of home sales was mixed   across areas but appeared little changed on net compared with the previous   reporting period; contacts noted that low mortgage interest rates helped to   sustain sales in general. However, an extensive supply of foreclosed properties   in some areas caused inventories to remain somewhat elevated, which in turn has   restrained the pace of new home construction. Demand weakened further for   commercial real estate, with vacancy rates for office and industrial space   rising further in many parts of the District. However, one contact in the   Pacific Northwest noted that the market may be approaching a bottom, citing an   increase in leasing activity in response to favorable terms for tenants.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely stable compared with the prior reporting period,   while credit quality declined further. Demand for commercial and industrial   loans continued to be restrained by businesses' uncertainty about the economic   environment and resulting caution in their capital spending plans. Demand for   consumer loans also was characterized as largely unchanged at low levels.   Contacts reported additional loan losses and continued tight standards for   business and consumer lending. Further small improvements in venture capital   funding and IPO activity were noted.
