      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in the Seventh District picked up some in   September. However, contacts continued to note uncertainty about the economic   outlook and expressed concerns about recent financial market developments.   Consumer spending was moderately higher and business spending increased   slightly. Manufacturing production picked up, while construction was little   changed. Credit conditions again tightened. There was further pass-through of   elevated wholesale prices to the retail level. Corn, soybean, wheat, milk, and   hog prices decreased, while cattle prices increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending was up moderately in   September. Auto sales were higher, due in part to increased incentives. On   balance, non-auto retail sales were essentially flat, though there were   considerable differences in sales growth across types of goods. For instance,   spending on electronics and appliances was up, while spending on furniture and   apparel was down. Sales of luxury goods continued to show some strength, and   sales in the lower price ranges of essential goods like personal care items and   groceries also rose. Retailers' outlook for consumer spending remained very   uncertain; and several contacts indicated that lower consumer confidence and   spending fatigue after heavier-than normal-promotions during the back-to-school   season had made them less optimistic about the upcoming holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending increased slightly in   September. Several manufacturing and construction contacts reported purchasing   equipment, with the incentive to take advantage of a higher level of accelerated   tax depreciation set to expire at year-end adding to the expected benefits of   expanding capacity and improving efficiency. A few manufacturers who anticipated   stronger demand also reported building inventories of raw materials now due to   concerns about potential long lead times for these inputs in the future. In   contrast, retailers were closely monitoring inventories, and some were paring   them back. Hiring remained slow. A staffing firm noted slower growth of billable   hours for staffing and professional services. In contrast, shortages of   qualified candidates were reported in healthcare, information technology,   engineering, and skilled manufacturing trades. These were most problematic in   manufacturing, and many manufacturers indicated that they were addressing the   shortfalls through training programs (including cross-training) for new and   existing employees. Looking ahead, a recruitment firm indicated that many   employers have lowered their expectations for staffing needs in the coming year.   Retail contacts expected minimal seasonal hiring this holiday season, and   instead planned to lengthen the workweek for permanent workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity was   again subdued in September. Residential real estate conditions remained weak;   builders reported very little new single-family home construction and showroom   traffic remained steady at a low level. Mortgage refinancing, however, picked up   with the recent declines in mortgage rates. Nonresidential construction was   little changed, on balance. Contacts noted an increase in industrial demand, in   particular from manufacturing and distribution clients, whereas demand from the   retail sector leveled off. Commercial real estate conditions improved slightly,   with vacancy rates edging down, rents stabilizing, and incentives to attract new   tenants increasing. Subleasing activity also rose, with contacts noting an   increase in seasonal demand for short-term sublets in strip malls.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production rebounded in   September, with new orders and order backlogs increasing. Demand for heavy   equipment was strong, led by robust activity in the construction, energy, and   mining sectors. Contacts attributed much of the pick-up in construction   equipment to replacement of dealer rental fleet inventory, which they expect to   continue moving forward. Demand for heavy and medium-duty trucks also increased.   Auto production was higher in September, reflecting rebuilding of inventories.   District auto suppliers reported that recent orders had exceeded expectations   along with concerns of being able to meet any additional demand in the   near-term. Capacity utilization in the steel industry remained elevated.   Production of industrial metals was up, while manufacturers of consumer products   reported some softening. Activity for food processors continued to be robust.   Contacts were cautiously optimistic about near-term prospects, pointing to   continued gains in productivity, strength in demand from Asia and Brazil, and   increased sales to local manufacturers looking to shorten their supply chains in   the aftermath of the disruptions caused by the Japanese disasters in the spring.   However, they remained concerned about the global economic outlook, with several   noting a reluctance to expand capacity given elevated uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions tightened further   in September. Volatility in financial markets remained elevated, although it was   lower than in August. Corporate funding costs edged higher, particularly for   financial firms, even though benchmark interest rates moved lower. Banking   contacts noted softer business and consumer loan demand, as clients were pulling   back on spending in light of increased risks coming from Europe and the weakness   in U.S. economic activity. Most lending activity was still in the form of   refinancing, which picked up with lower long-term interest rates. In another   positive sign, contacts noted an increase in M&amp;A activity among   middle-market firms, even with the increase in spreads and lower liquidity in   the high yield and term loan markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Raw materials prices declined, but   continued to put pressure on costs in September. Prices for industrial metals   like copper and steel eased further, but contacts again reported extended lead   times for specialty metals as well as some shortages. Energy prices were also   lower, and fuel surcharges began to decline. Conversely, retailers indicated   that wholesale price pressures intensified, with food prices still elevated and   prices for cotton-based goods rising. While some retailers continued to absorb   some of these higher costs in their margins, pass-through to downstream prices   increased. Wage pressures remained moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Harvest conditions varied across the   District. Some parts were experiencing a slower-than-usual harvest due to late   planting or fall rains that degraded crop quality. Other portions of the   District were experiencing a fairly normal harvest. Corn and soybean yields   appeared to be lower and more variable than a year ago. Nonetheless, yields were   adequate to replenish inventories to levels that eased worries about shortages.   Inventories also were boosted over the summer by lower exports and reduced usage   of crops for livestock feed. Corn and soybean prices did back off during the   reporting period; however, a sizeable portion of the crop had been sold prior to   this decline. Lower prices for feedstocks provided relief to livestock   operators. Prices for milk and hogs declined while cattle price rose; all three   remained above the levels of a year ago. Farmland values and cash rental rates   continued to rise in the District.
