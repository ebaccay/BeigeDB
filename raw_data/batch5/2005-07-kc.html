      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded solidly in June and early July. Non-automotive 

  retail sales posted further gains, auto sales improved sharply, and labor markets 

  continued to firm. Manufacturing activity also grew moderately, and commercial 

  real estate activity improved. In addition, energy activity remained strong, 

  and agricultural conditions were positive. Residential construction edged down, 

  but housing activity remained solid overall. Price pressures eased slightly 

  at both the wholesale and retail levels, while wage pressures remained moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending in the district continued to increase in June and early July. 

  Most retailers, mall managers, and restaurants reported solid year-over-year 

  increases in activity, with sales generally at or above plan. Sales of electronics, 

  appliances, and outdoor furniture were characterized as strong, while sales 

  of home improvement items, hardware, and indoor furnishings were said to be 

  weak at some stores. Many stores reduced inventories since the last survey, 

  and most managers were satisfied with current stock levels. Nearly all store 

  managers were optimistic about future sales. Auto dealers reported strong vehicle 

  sales since the last survey, driven largely by new price discounts from manufacturers. 

  The increased activity pushed sales above year-ago levels at many dealerships. 

  The strongest sales were reported for new trucks and fuel efficient cars, while 

  sales of used vehicles and large SUVs were characterized as weak by some dealers. 

  Most dealers expect sales to remain strong in the months ahead. Travel and tourism 

  activity in the district increased strongly in June and early July. Most hotels 

  reported occupancy rates were up from both the previous survey and a year ago, 

  and nearly all tourism contacts expect further increases in activity in coming 

  months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity expanded moderately in June and early July. 

  Many plant managers reported increases in production, shipments, and orders 

  since the previous survey, and some firms added workers and hours. Growth in 

  capital spending remained strong at most plants. Plant managers said materials 

  were generally available, although petroleum-based materials were reported to 

  be scarce in some areas. Expectations for future factory activity remained solid, 

  and many plants plan further additions to their workforces.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity remained solid in June and early July despite some easing in 

  construction, and commercial real estate activity improved further. Most builders 

  reported that housing starts edged down and were slightly below year-ago levels. 

  However, new home construction was still generally characterized as strong. 

  Builders reported few difficulties obtaining materials and most do not expect 

  problems heading forward. Home starts are expected to remain steady in the months 

  ahead. Real estate agents reported home sales increased slightly from both the 

  previous survey and a year ago. Home prices were up moderately from a year ago 

  in most cities. Real estate agents expect home sales to continue to rise in 

  coming months, while home prices are expected to level off in some cities. In 

  a few cities, purchases of homes for investment purposes were reported to be 

  putting downward pressure on home rental rates. Mortgage lenders reported an 

  increase in demand for both new home purchase loans and refinancings since the 

  previous survey, and they expect demand for new home mortgages to rise further. 

  Commercial real estate activity in the district improved further in June and 

  early July. Vacancy rates edged down in several markets, and prices for office 

  space were up moderately in some cities. Some commercial real estate agents 

  expect activity to continue to increase in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report that loans and deposits both increased slightly since the last 

  survey, leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand rose moderately for commercial 

  and industrial loans and edged up for home mortgages, residential construction 

  loans, and commercial real estate loans. Demand for consumer loans was unchanged. 

  On the deposit side, all types of accounts increased slightly. All respondents 

  increased their prime lending rates since the last survey, and almost all respondents 

  raised their consumer lending rates. Lending standards were generally unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity remained strong in June and early July. The count of 

  active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region was basically unchanged from 

  both the previous survey and a year ago. Several contacts continued to cite 

  constraints on drilling due to rig shortages and regulatory factors. In order 

  to increase drilling heading forward, some rig operators in the district placed 

  orders for new rigs to be delivered later this year, including some that are 

  being shipped from China. One large rig operator also plans to begin producing 

  some of its own rigs. In addition, a few energy firms are proposing to test 

  new drilling techniques in Wyoming next winter designed to reduce impacts on 

  the environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions remained generally positive in June and early July. 

  With the winter wheat harvest nearly complete, overall yields were slightly 

  better than a year ago. Corn and soybean crops were also reported to be in good 

  to excellent condition across the district. On the negative side, some contacts 

  said higher energy prices were boosting irrigation costs. In the livestock market, 

  a seasonal rise in U.S. cattle supplies and the announced resumption of live 

  cattle imports from Canada have placed some downward pressure on cattle prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets in the district firmed further in June and early July, but wage 

  increases remained moderate. Hiring announcements exceeded layoff announcements 

  by a considerable margin, and several military bases in the district learned 

  they will be adding considerably more personnel than originally announced in 

  May. The percentage of contacts experiencing labor shortages increased somewhat 

  from the previous survey, with most of the shortages reported for either low-skilled 

  or high-skilled workers. In addition, several contacts noted an increase in 

  help-wanted advertisements in their areas. However, the share of firms reporting 

  wage pressures remained moderate, lower than before the last recession but higher 

  than a year ago. Some contacts expect wage pressures to increase slightly in 

  the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures eased somewhat at both the wholesale and retail levels in June 

  and early July. The share of manufacturers reporting materials price increases 

  continued to fall, and most users of steel reported price declines. On the other 

  hand, prices for many petroleum-based products rose. The share of manufacturers 

  raising output prices also fell slightly, and fewer plant managers than in previous 

  surveys expect materials prices and output prices to rise in the months ahead. 

  However, the share of firms planning to raise prices remains relatively high 

  by historical standards. Most builders reported increased costs for materials, 

  especially for plywood, and expect further increases heading forward. Retailers 

  generally reported flat selling prices in June and early July after reporting 

  slight price increases in the previous two surveys. However, a number of stores 

  plan to raise prices on some products in the months ahead.
