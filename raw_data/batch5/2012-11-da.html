      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Eleventh District economy expanded at a modest pace over the past six weeks.   Reports on manufacturing and transportation services activity were mixed. Demand   for staffing services declined, while that for other business services held   steady or increased slightly. Retailers' reports on demand were mixed, while   automobiles sales were flat. Residential sales and construction increased, and   energy activity remained steady at high levels. Financial firms reported mixed   demand. Agricultural conditions remained mostly dry. Most respondents said   prices held steady, and employment levels were steady to up. Many firms'   outlooks remain uncertain, given regulatory and fiscal concerns and short-term   disruptions caused by Hurricane Sandy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Most reporting firms said prices were steady,   however there were a few scattered reports of higher prices. Retailers said   prices had not changed much since the last report, but the drought is expected   to increase food costs. Some transportation services firms noted that prices   were up due to increased fuel and labor costs. Several manufacturers of   construction products said that stronger demand was supporting higher prices.   Some paper manufacturers noted an increase in selling prices. Grain prices   declined over the reporting period and cotton prices remained weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       The price of WTI was volatile during the reporting period but ended up in the   mid-$80 per barrel range. Natural gas prices, while still depressed, rose to   $3.40 per thousand cubic feet over the same period. On-highway diesel and   gasoline prices trended down over the reporting period, and prices of   petrochemical products were mostly flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Market
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Employment held steady or increased at most   responding firms. Accounting and legal firms reported hiring, and one staffing   firm was adding to its payrolls despite a recent slowdown in demand for   temporary workers. Shortages of truck drivers continued to be noted by   transportation service firms and there were scattered shortages of workers at   energy-related firms. Wage pressures remained subdued.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Overall demand for construction-related   products was mixed. Demand for stone, clay, cement, glass, and lumber held   steady or improved, and outlooks were more optimistic compared with the previous   report. Demand for fabricated metals products held steady over the past month,   but contacts noted that overall demand has been steadily improving since the   beginning of 2012. Primary metals manufacturers characterized demand as poor   over the past six weeks and said that they expect continued weakness in sales   through year-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       High-tech manufacturers said that shipments and new orders declined since the   last report. Demand for industrial and computing products was particularly weak,   and contacts noted weakness in personal computer sales was negatively impacting   sales of other related hardware such as printers. One respondent noted that   while orders have declined recently, cancellations have not increased,   suggesting that declines in orders may be due to thinning of inventories not due   to slowing of final demand. Continued high uncertainty about economic prospects   was restraining capital investment, and respondents expected sustained weakness   over the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for paper products was flat to up, and most contacts were slightly   more optimistic in their outlook. Food producers reported stable demand over the   past month, and noted that sales were higher than a year ago. Overall,   transportation equipment manufacturers said demand was flat to down over the   past six weeks. Demand for aviation equipment held steady. Outlooks were   cautiously optimistic, and contacts expect demand to pick up in the second half   of 2013. A producer of recreational vehicles noted a slight lull in sales, and   an emergency vehicle manufacturer reported stable demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petrochemicals producers noted Gulf Coast chemical production was up   slightly, but uncertainty cautioned firms' outlooks. Gulf Coast refiners said   they were operating at rates above 90 percent, and strong export demand was   keeping inventories from building.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Retailers said demand was mixed over the   past six weeks. Sales in the Eleventh District continued to outperform the   nation, according to two national retailers. Contacts said the loss in sales   resulting from Hurricane Sandy was temporary and would not impact holiday   spending. Outlooks through year-end were mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall automobile sales were flat, while new vehicle sales declined slightly   since the last report. One contact noted that obtaining credit approval has not   been an issue and customers wanting to buy cars can get financing. Prices are   stable, but margins are thin. Outlooks remain positive for the fourth quarter,   but contacts expect the cost of doing business to increase next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Staffing firms said demand "came to a sudden   stop" over the past six weeks, as several clients delayed hiring until after the   election. Declines were reported in orders from mid-sized manufacturing and   construction firms. However, one contact noted steady demand for professional,   technical, and information technology positions. Outlooks were mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, accounting firms noted steady demand for their services. Demand for   insurance and audit services was robust, while that for tax services was flat to   slightly down. Real estate related activity remained weak. Outlooks were more   positive than earlier in the year, with contacts expecting an increase in tax   and transactional related services in the near-term. Legal firms reported a   modest pickup in activity, with continued strength in intellectual property   litigation, energy and real estate-related services. Outlooks for next year were   upbeat among legal industry contacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from transportation service firms were mixed. Intermodal cargo   volumes declined, while container volumes increased over the reporting period.   Railroads said cargo volumes declined slightly over the past four weeks, with   declines in shipments of coal, metals, primary forest materials, and metallic   ores outpacing increases in shipments of grain, chemicals, lumber and wood, and   motor vehicles. Airlines noted that demand was flat to down since the last   report. Demand for domestic travel declined, while that for international travel   was strong. Airline contacts were cautious and uncertain in their outlooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Single-family housing   activity remained strong. Both new and existing home sales activity increased   over the past six weeks. Contacts noted that despite a pickup in new   construction, low inventories of both existing and new homes have led to   moderate price increases overall. Apartment construction remained robust, but   contacts said that leasing activity slowed. Outlooks are positive through   year-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts in the commercial real estate industry said that demand for office   and industrial space continued to increase since the last report. Contacts said   that some businesses were holding back on expansions due to uncertainty, but   overall outlooks remained positive. Investment activity remains less aggressive   than earlier in the year, although some contacts noted that investment in   apartment development remains quite strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Financial institutions reported mixed   loan demand. Contacts said used auto lending was weak, while first mortgages and   energy-related lending increased. Loan pricing continues to be very competitive,   partly due to loosening credit standards. Despite low deposit rates, deposit   levels at most institutions remain high. Contacts expressed concern about new   regulations for community banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Respondents at energy-related service firms said   activity remained steady at high levels despite a decline in the rig count that   was mostly natural gas related. Although oil prices remain at healthy enough   levels to support current activity, recent price declines coupled with high   volatility are making some firms nervous about drilling in higher cost fields.   Contacts expect activity to be flat through year-end, with improvement in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
        <br/>
       </strong>
       The District remained largely in drought,   although dry conditions eased in some areas. The crop harvest generally   progressed at a good pace. Winter wheat crop conditions were much better than   last year, when the drought was more severe in the District. Grain prices   trended down over the reporting period but were still at relatively high levels.   Cotton prices remained weak and may lead to fewer cotton acres being planted   next year. Cattle prices were still higher than normal but contacts noted that   high feed costs were keeping producers from expanding their operations and were   creating negative margins for feedlots.
