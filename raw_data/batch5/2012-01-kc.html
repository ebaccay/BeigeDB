      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded at a modest pace in late November and   December. Consumer spending softened, with weakness in auto, restaurant, and   tourism sales. District manufacturing activity contracted slightly, though   factory operators remained optimistic about growth in the coming months.   High-tech firms reported continued strong growth, while transportation activity   was flat. Residential and commercial real estate conditions remained broadly   weak, but contacts expressed increased optimism about sales and prices in the   coming months. District banks reported generally steady loan demand and improved   loan quality. High crude oil prices buoyed activity in the District's energy   sector. Agricultural growing conditions improved, but higher input and   production costs constrained farm profits. Rising input costs were reported in   several sectors, but few District contacts noted either hiring shortages or wage   pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending softened in late   November and December, with a slowdown in the auto, restaurant, and tourism   sectors. Many District contacts attributed the weakness in spending to ongoing   regulatory and political uncertainty. Most retailers, however, expected spending   to rise over the next three months. Following several months of strong activity,   auto dealers reported a dip in sales with slower sales expected in coming   months. Auto inventories increased over the previous survey period, and most   dealers reported satisfaction with current levels. Restaurant sales were flat   despite larger average check amounts. However, restaurant contacts expected   sales to rebound over the next three months. Tourism activity slowed, as winter   storms hampered some tourist activity but helped ski resorts. Hoteliers reported   lower occupancy rates but stable average room rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity contracted slightly during the survey period, but factory operators   remained optimistic about the coming months. Activity was broadly weaker, with   production, shipments, and new orders lower relative to the prior survey. The   weakest sectors were food processing and fabricated metals, while growth in   machinery and high-tech manufacturing remained strong. Order backlogs,   manufacturing employment, and average hours worked declined. Despite weaker   activity, expectations were positive for the coming months for production,   shipments, and orders. Transportation firms reported mostly unchanged conditions   as activity remained well above year-ago levels. Most high-tech services firms   reported sales gains and increased capital spending. Contacts in both the   transportation and high-tech sectors reported continued difficulty finding   skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   real estate activity remained sluggish in late November and December. District   home prices were flat, but most real estate contacts expected prices to rise   along with home sales over the next three months. Multiple contacts reported   multi-family housing as a source of strength in the housing market. Mortgage   lenders reported weak mortgage demand with fewer home purchases and refinancings   relative to the previous survey period. Lenders cited stricter mortgage lending   requirements as a key factor underlying weak loan demand. Housing starts   declined further, and expectations about future construction activity remained   subdued. Construction supply firms reported weak sales over the survey period,   and most expected little change in activity over the coming months. Commercial   real estate sales, prices, and vacancy rates improved, and District contacts   were more optimistic about the coming months. Rents on commercial properties   were stable and expected to rise over the next three months. Developers reported   little change in access to credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Almost all bankers reported generally steady loan   demand, stable or improving loan quality, and increased deposits. Loan demand by   category was mixed. Most respondents reported steady loan demand for commercial   and industrial loans, commercial and residential real estate loans, and consumer   installment loans. Remaining respondents were split between stronger and weaker   demand within each of these categories. Credit standards remained largely   unchanged in all major loan categories and deposits increased for the eighth   straight survey. Bankers generally reported loan quality as steady or improving   compared to a year ago and reported the outlook for loan quality over the next   six months as steady or improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural growing conditions improved in   late November and December but farm income prospects dimmed with high input   costs. Timely rains eased drought conditions in the Southern Plains. Most of the   winter wheat crop emerged in good condition, though more protective snow cover   was needed for the winter dormancy period. Volatile crop prices and high input   costs tempered crop profit expectations for the coming year. High production   costs trimmed margins for livestock operators even though strong export demand   underpinned prices. Still, with historically high profits, many farmers were   repaying operating loans, buying farmland and purchasing additional machinery   and equipment. District contacts reported an increase in the number of farmland   auctions as record high land prices enticed more landowners to sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy and mining contacts reported   continued strong activity in late November and December and remained optimistic   about the coming months. Drilling rig counts were flat in most District states   but remained well above year-ago levels. Drilling continued to shift away from   dry natural gas and toward liquid-rich formations. However, crude exploration in   the Niobrara formation in Wyoming slowed as contacts reported better   opportunities in other areas. Producers expected stable crude prices but   relatively weak natural gas prices over the next three months. Attracting   qualified workers and finding adequate equipment remained a concern for oil and   gas contacts. District coal production declined slightly in November and   December and remained below year-ago levels. A recent drop in ethanol prices   trimmed margins for ethanol producers despite lower input costs and strong   export demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts reported higher prices   for both inputs and finished goods, but wage pressures remained confined to   select industries and occupations. Manufacturers reported an uptick in input   prices in late November and December, but relatively few reported higher   finished goods prices. Manufacturers expected further price increases for both   inputs and finished goods in the coming months. Most restaurants reported a   continued rise in food costs and expected further increases over the next three   months. Retailers and transportation firms increased prices in the latest survey   period, while construction suppliers reported falling prices due to weak   building demand. Few contacts outside of the energy, high-tech, and   transportation sectors reported either hiring shortages or upward wage   pressures, and most expected little wage pressure in the coming months. Rising   employee benefit costs, particularly for health care, remained a concern for   many contacts.
