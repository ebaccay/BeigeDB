      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District improved slightly in November. Manufacturers 
  posted small increases in shipments, but there were also marginal declines in 
  new orders. Retail sales of general merchandise rose. However, auto sales did 
  not increase. Bank lending increased overall, although not strongly, but mortgage 
  lending declined. Residential real estate activity continued to decrease; by 
  contrast, commercial real estate markets tightened further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District business contacts generally expect business activity to continue 
  to expand, but at a slow pace; however, they anticipate further softening in 
  residential real estate. Manufacturers expect some improvement during the winter. 
  Retailers are forecasting increased sales for the upcoming holiday season compared 
  to a year ago. Auto dealers do not expect sales to pick up in the near future. 
  Bankers anticipate slight gains in business and consumer lending but a further 
  decline in mortgage lending. Residential real estate agents and builders expect 
  further slowing in home sales through the winter. Contacts in commercial real 
  estate expect demand for office and industrial space to remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported little change in business conditions from 
  October to November. On balance, they reported a slight increase in shipments 
  and a slight decrease in new orders. The decrease in orders affected most of 
  the region's major manufacturing sectors, although makers of food products and 
  apparel generally noted rising demand. Area manufacturers reported an easing 
  in order backlogs but also a small increase in delivery times.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, manufacturers expect demand for their products to increase, but they 
  are not forecasting strong gains. Among the manufacturers contacted in November, 
  a little more than one-third expect their shipments and orders to increase during 
  the next six months; about one-fifth expect decreases. The capital spending 
  plans of Third District manufacturers increased between October and November. 
  On balance, however, the number of firms scheduling increased outlays remained 
  below the number that raised capital spending earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the retailers contacted for this report indicated that sales have increased 
  in recent weeks, although the strength of growth varied among stores. Department 
  stores and most apparel specialty stores reported that sales of new fall merchandise 
  have been up solidly compared with a year ago. Sales growth for most other types 
  of stores and lines of merchandise has not been robust, and sales of home improvement 
  items have been generally below retailers' plans. Looking ahead, area retailers 
  expect current trends to last through the holiday shopping season. Area retail 
  executives expect sales growth to continue at the current rate for department 
  stores, most apparel specialty stores, and for luxury merchandise. They say 
  prospects for growth are less strong for discount stores and for home furnishings, 
  appliances, and consumer electronics.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto sales in the region showed no signs of increasing in November, and some 
  dealers reported a slowing in sales. Year-to-year sales comparisons continued 
  to be better for foreign makes than for domestic makes. Inventories remained 
  above desired levels for many dealers but did not appear to be increasing. Auto 
  dealers in the region expect sales to remain sluggish through the winter, and 
  they say the outlook for 2007 is uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The volume of loans outstanding at Third District banks rose slightly in November, 
  according to commercial bank lending officers contacted for this report. Commercial 
  and industrial lending increased for most banks, but many said the rate of growth 
  had slowed recently. Credit card lending expanded, but the rate of increase 
  has eased somewhat. Growth in other types of personal lending also slowed, and 
  some banks reported substantial softening of demand for personal credit. Demand 
  for residential mortgages continued to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the District expect business and consumer lending to increase slowly 
  in the months ahead, but they foresee a further decline in the demand for residential 
  mortgages. Bankers noted that both business and personal loan quality was good. 
  However, several bankers said they are concerned that builders, land developers, 
  and other firms involved in residential real estate and construction might soon 
  face cash flow problems, and they are monitoring these borrowers closely.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate firms reported that vacancy rates in the region's office 
  markets have continued to decline in the past few months, and rents have risen. 
  The amount of leased space has increased in both the Philadelphia and Wilmington 
  central business districts and in suburban markets throughout the region. The 
  increase in occupancy has resulted in a scarcity of large blocks of available 
  space. Commercial real estate contacts report that there has been an increase 
  in the construction of buildings to accommodate anticipated demand for large 
  blocks of space with up-to-date features, while demand for space in older buildings 
  is falling. Demand for office space and high-tech research and manufacturing 
  facilities is expected to increase into next year, with much of the demand coming 
  from firms in the financial, health care, and pharmaceutical industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate agents and homebuilders surveyed in November indicated 
  that sales were declining, continuing the sharp slowdown that began during the 
  summer. Real estate contacts noted that the number of existing homes for sale 
  and the time they are on the market have risen. Home builders reported significant 
  increases in cancellations. They have reduced prices for resold houses and increased 
  the value of free upgrades for all houses sold. Price appreciation of existing 
  homes in recent months has been well below the pace recorded over the past few 
  years. Homebuilders and real estate agents expect the pace of sales to slow 
  further during the winter. While most expect sales to recover next spring, several 
  said they do not anticipate a substantial rebound.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business firms in the Third District noted increases in the costs of raw materials 
  and other inputs, although reports of price increases were not as widespread 
  in November as they were earlier in the autumn. Manufacturers noted continued 
  increases in prices for metals and energy, although the incidence of such increases 
  appears to have slowed since the summer. Retailers indicated that they have 
  implemented price reductions for some lines of merchandise, especially consumer 
  electronics and home appliances, but that prices for most other types of goods 
  have been kept near plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employers in many industries reported that labor markets remain tight for 
  skilled workers and some professional occupations. Retailers noted that they 
  have had some difficulty in hiring temporary sales workers for the holiday season. 
  In contrast, the slowdown in residential construction has resulted in greater 
  availability of construction workers. Area employers indicated that wages have 
  been rising at a nearly steady rate in the past few months, somewhat above the 
  rate of increase recorded earlier this year and a year ago.
