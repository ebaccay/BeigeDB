      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew at a steady pace since the last report. Increases 
  in activity were noted in consumer spending, manufacturing, tourism, construction, 
  mining, energy, agriculture, and commercial real estate. Meanwhile, residential 
  real estate softened. Since the last report, the pace of employment and wage 
  growth increased slightly. Significant price increases were noted for fuel and 
  some construction materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall consumer spending showed solid growth since the last report. A major 
  Minneapolis-based retailer reported same-store sales up about 6 percent in May 
  compared with a year ago. A mall manager in North Dakota said that traffic on 
  Mother's Day weekend was fairly brisk. In contrast, same-store sales at a Minneapolis 
  area mall in April were lower than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in south-central Montana noted that while consumers are more interested 
  in purchasing four-cylinder cars, sales of trucks and SUVs were still solid. 
  At a Minnesota dealership, May sales were strong, especially for fuel-efficient 
  vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spring tourism activity posted modest increases, while tourism officials are 
  cautiously optimistic for the summer season despite higher gas prices. In Duluth, 
  Minn., recent tourism spending was up about 5 percent compared with a year ago, 
  and inquiries for summer activities were strong; business convention spending 
  was about even with a year ago. Tourism businesses in northwestern Minnesota 
  reported a positive outlook for summer activity. Tourism in Montana is expected 
  to grow 2 percent in 2006. According to a tourism official in the Black Hills 
  area of South Dakota, advanced summer bookings started slow but recently reached 
  normal trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction was robust. Commercial construction was about level with last year's 
  strong building season in Bismarck, N.D. Developers announced plans for a 1.3-million-square-foot 
  office and commercial development in a Minneapolis suburb. The Minnesota Legislature 
  approved funding for two large stadiums in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Construction 
  began on downtown condos in both Sioux Falls, S.D., and Fargo, N.D. More than 
  $94 million in spending on road and bridge construction and $84 million on state 
  university projects is planned in Montana this summer. However, April year-to-date 
  residential and commercial permits for Rochester, Minn., were down 12 percent 
  in value from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate continued to cool. New listings in Minneapolis-St. 
  Paul during the third week of May were up 18 percent over last year, while pending 
  sales were down 21 percent. Inventories in Sioux Falls were up 18 percent from 
  a year ago. In contrast, home sales remained strong in western Montana. The 
  commercial real estate market grew steadily. A bank director reported office, 
  retail, and industrial real estate in Sioux Falls as strong overall but down 
  from last year's record levels. In Minneapolis, commercial office absorption 
  continued to increase; for example, a large company is moving to a 188,000-square-foot 
  office tower downtown. A representative of a commercial real estate firm in 
  Minneapolis-St. Paul noted that businesses that require relatively high volumes 
  of office space were having difficulty finding openings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded. A May survey of purchasing managers by Creighton 
  University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated strong growth of manufacturing activity in 
  the Dakotas and Minnesota. A safety gear manufacturer in Minnesota is expanding 
  into a new plant. Meanwhile, a sewing company in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan 
  reported strong demand and is planning to add space. A commercial bakery in 
  Montana is adding production space, machinery, and equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity was up slightly in the energy and mining sectors. The number of oil 
  rigs operating in the District increased since the last report. In addition, 
  several new coal-fired power plants, wind farms, and ethanol distilleries are 
  under construction or in the permitting process. One Minneapolis Fed Agriculture 
  Advisory Council member noted that ethanol and biodiesel plants are "springing 
  up like popcorn." Meanwhile, nearly all open mines in the District are producing 
  at near full capacity. Several companies are exploring or permitting new mining 
  sites throughout the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity increased slightly since the last report, but prospects 
  for farm income have deteriorated. A good calving and lambing season is mostly 
  complete across the District, with some minor losses reported in areas due to 
  inclement weather. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that crop plantings 
  and progress are slightly ahead of last year's pace in most District states. 
  Spring storms aided moisture conditions across most of the District, although 
  central South Dakota is dry. This year's estimated winter wheat yields per acre 
  are up, but production in Montana is down 14 percent from 2005. Responses to 
  the Minneapolis Fed's first-quarter (April) agricultural credit conditions survey 
  indicate that overall agricultural income will be down in the second quarter 
  of 2006 due to higher costs of fertilizer, fuel, and machinery. Meanwhile, the 
  USDA recently estimated that prices of corn, soybeans, and cattle will decrease 
  this year compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment grew moderately since the last report. In North Dakota, a wind turbine 
  blade plant will soon add up to 130 jobs, and in South Dakota, a communications 
  company is adding 120 jobs. Two business schools in Minneapolis-St. Paul reported 
  an approximate 20 percent increase in the number of graduates with job offers 
  this year; accounting and finance were among the top areas. North Dakota members 
  of the Minneapolis Fed's Advisory Council on Small Business and Labor noted 
  difficulty finding available labor, particularly low-skilled workers. Preliminary 
  results of the inaugural Minneapolis Fed's May survey of professional services 
  companies indicated increased employment and decreased availability of labor 
  for the next four quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      A slight increase in the pace of wage raises was noted since the last report. 
  In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, wages for many trades, hospitals, and manufacturers 
  were up by about 3 percent to 4 percent. A bank director noted that the starting 
  wage for unskilled workers in Bozeman, Mont., is $6.50, well above the minimum 
  wage. Preliminary results of the professional services survey show an expected 
  average wage increase of about 3 percent during the next four quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Significant price increases were noted in fuel, health insurance, and some 
  construction materials. Gasoline prices in Minnesota were up 79 cents at the 
  end of May compared with a year ago. Freight fuel surcharges have increased 
  to as high as 27 percent of total mileage, according to a Montana bank director. 
  A number of construction materials increased in price, including copper, insulation, 
  steel, and wallboard; in contrast, some lumber prices softened. Preliminary 
  results of the professional services survey reveal that 73 percent of respondents 
  expect overall inflation to increase during the next four quarters.
