      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 12, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions continue to improve in the First District in the waning   months of 2010. Most contacted retailers report year-over-year sales increases,   manufacturers generally continue to see expansion, and advertising and   consulting firms cite relatively strong growth. Respondents in these three   sectors indicate employment is stable to rising, with more of the same planned   for 2011. Commercial real estate markets are said to be stable, while   residential real estate continues in the doldrums. Selected commodities are   causing some price pressures, but contacts report only modest pass-through into   sales prices to date. The outlook for 2011 is generally positive, albeit   moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of contacted First District retailers   report positive sales results for the months of November and December.   Year-over-year comparable same-store sales are mostly increases ranging from the   low single digits to the low double digits, with the exception of one contact   who reports a drop in same-store sales but notes a recent positive turn. Several   retailers indicate that consumers continue to react positively to promotions.   Sales of apparel, sporting goods, cameras, and other gift items were strong   leading up to Christmas. Respondents generally are pleased with early holiday   shopping results.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts report mixed inventory levels in comparison to plan. As for prices,   retailers note cost increases for commodities, including cotton, rubber, and   nuts. Several respondents observe price pressure in the industry, but have yet   to experience it themselves. Some contacts have worked to lock in pricing   through vendor contracts; a couple say that vendors may be absorbing price   increases or working to cover increases through product reengineering to keep   their selling prices steady. Retailers say that price increases passed on to   consumers, if any, will be selective. Headcounts continue to increase in line   with new store openings, although a few firms are taking measures to reduce   redundancy and consolidate headcount to gain other efficiencies. One respondent   is concerned that uncertain potential employer costs associated with healthcare   reform may affect hiring. Capital spending is mixed, with several retailers   reducing capital spending now that one-time expansion projects have been   completed. Outlooks are generally cautiously optimistic, with most contacts   forecasting a slow and steady improvement in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of   manufacturing firms surveyed continue to report relatively positive business   conditions. The exceptions include one firm with exposure to the residential   construction sector, whose business has been sluggish for an extended period,   and a few others whose business tends to be a-cyclical. On the positive side, a   small diversified manufacturer reports sales growth in the high single digits   and notes that its revenues have returned to pre-recession levels. A company in   the electronics business says that its sales growth in the fourth quarter was   slightly ahead of expectations, but is likely to be somewhat inconsistent going   forward due to uncertainty about future large contracts. In addition, sales at a   semi-conductor firm remain strong relative to 2009 and are on par with their   strong results in third quarter 2010; a food products manufacturer also reports   strong sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of contacted firms continue to try to reduce or limit their   inventories to maintain lean operations. By contrast, a few other firms report   trying to increase their inventories somewhat either to meet higher demand or to   try to offset continued supply constraints or disruptions. Plastics are one   intermediate input that remains difficult to obtain, and a semi-conductor   manufacturer reports that components necessary for its production process remain   in short supply. These supply constraints have yet to translate into higher   input or output prices for the affected firms. Increases in commodity prices are   the main source of price pressure amongst responding firms; the prices of   precious metals continue to rise as do the prices of grains and sugars. The   manufacturers affected by these higher input prices have tried to pass along   some or all of their increased costs to consumers in the fourth quarter or they   plan price increases in early 2011, but they are not certain the increases will   stick. Overall, selling prices remain relatively stable at the majority of   contacted manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers continue to report stable to slightly increasing employment.   The firms that are hiring tend to be increasing their headcount in skilled   positions and/or in production workers to meet increased demand; none are   planning substantial increases. Firms' capital expenditures are little changed   from previous reports. Most contacted companies anticipate their capital   spending in 2011 will be roughly in line with 2010. Those firms who have   increased capital expenditures or plan to do so are directing the spending   toward IT upgrades or increased plant capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing respondents have mixed, but generally positive outlooks for   2011. One firm reports being "very optimistic" about next year, while most are   "cautiously optimistic." In comparison, the firm that has been struggling   recently said the outlook for the next three to six months is "lackluster." Many   contacted firms remain concerned about their health care costs going forward,   and a few expect that the macroeconomic uncertainty will continue to weigh on   their sales growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Selected Business Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Advertising and consulting   contacts in the First District report significant growth in demand during the   fourth quarter of 2010, with increases in revenue ranging from 5 percent to 30   percent. Most contacts attribute the rise to pent-up demand across many sectors   and industries, as clients have been restrained by economic conditions since   2008. Responding firms held their prices steady or increased them slightly in   the fourth quarter; some are planning to raise prices about 5 percent in 2011.   Changes in business costs vary, with some firms citing stable wages, some   raising compensation, and one firm cutting costs by hiring lower wage-rate   replacements for selected employees. All contacts plan to increase employment   next year to meet recent and expected increases in demand, with net hiring of 5   percent to 20 percent. Some of them expect salaries to stay stable through 2011,   while some expect modest increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts are highly optimistic about their near-term performance and   throughout 2011, mostly based on the increased volume of deals already secured   and growing inquiries from clients. Expectations about general economic recovery   in 2011 contribute to these projections as well. They expect annual growth in   revenue ranging from 5 percent to 15 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England's commercial real   estate market was stable in recent weeks. In Boston, a steady volume of lease   renewals generated significant revenue for brokers but resulted in little to no   net absorption. For the year, office vacancy increased in greater Boston and,   according to one contact, is currently in the high teens in the Financial   District, while Back Bay and Cambridge enjoy much lower rates (below 10   percent). In Providence and Portland, modest positive absorption is cited in   core downtown districts, as tenants are eager to sign deals to take advantage of   low rental rates, which are not expected to persist much longer. In Hartford,   the vacancy rate for downtown, class A office space was placed at 24 percent for   the third quarter; there is some expectation that the city's office absorption   rate will turn modestly positive in 2011. Construction remains limited across   the region, with the exception of the multifamily sector, which continues to   attract strong investor interest and very attractive financing terms. Based on   recent sales prices, one Boston lender to commercial real estate is concerned   that the city's multifamily market may be "overheating."
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook ranges from quite cautious to solidly optimistic. Boston and   Hartford contacts expect slow growth and only limited absorption in 2011.   Prospects for absorption in 2011 were more robust in Providence and Portland,   and a Boston banking contact expects very strong loan demand for commercial   properties throughout 2011. No contacts are predicting a "double-dip" in the   commercial real estate market (nor for the economy as a whole). Nonetheless, a   few are concerned that commercial foreclosures could increase in 2011, putting   downward pressure on property values.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home and condo sales in the First   District continued to show significant year-over-year declines in November, as   many contacts had expected. Respondents say the large year-over-year declines   throughout New England partially stem from the extra boost in activity observed   in November 2009 when the first-time homebuyer tax credit was originally set to   expire. Nonetheless, home and condo sales activity remains sluggish by any   measure throughout the region, with all contacts anticipating that total 2010   sales will fall short of 2009. Meanwhile, the median price of homes continues to   edge up in the New England states, with the exception of New Hampshire, which   observed another month of year-over-year price declines. Contacts attribute   increasing median home prices to relatively higher sales of more expensive   properties rather than a general upward movement in home prices. Second-home   purchases continue to fare well relative to other segments of the market, as   higher income buyers take advantage of low mortgage rates and a large inventory   of discounted homes. Most contacts report that inventory levels are rising; they   do not see this as a source of concern except for a contact in New Hampshire,   where the November months of supply exceeded other states in the region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts anticipate a continuation of current sluggish activity levels into   2011, with fewer swings than in 2010. Some respondents express concern about   possible tax reforms restricting the mortgage interest deduction.
