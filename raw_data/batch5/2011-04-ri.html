      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifth District economic activity generally improved since our last report.   Manufacturers' new orders rose and port activity picked up, with raw commodities   helping to drive exports. Bank officials reported some increased volume in   commercial loan demand, as business clients restarted projects that had been put   on hold. Revenue growth among non-retail services firms was more widespread in   recent weeks, with notable increases in demand for freight trucking and   tourism-related services. Residential real estate markets edged up, especially   for homes in the lower price range. Commercial leasing improved somewhat.   District labor markets picked up, particularly for temporary workers in   automotive and other manufacturing sectors. On the other hand, commercial   construction remained weak and retail contacts reported soft sales. Input price   growth continued to pick up in both manufacturing and services sectors and we   heard concerns about the availability of raw materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand   at a solid pace in March. An auto-parts supplier said that orders at his plant   had increased beyond available capacity and he indicated that lead times had   increased due to the scarcity of materials. He mentioned that levels of   inventories were much lower than desired, and in some cases were nonexistent,   causing backlogs of orders for both aftermarket and service parts. Similarly, a   packaging manufacturer told us that vendor delay in selected raw materials had   affected his company, and he described transportation costs as a growing worry.   A manufacturer of dental equipment reported an increase in business throughout   his company; he noted that the gains included existing and new accounts. In   contrast, several manufacturers who supply products to federal government   agencies attributed the lack of new contracts to the uncertainties surrounding   the budget for fiscal year 2011, but they expected that business would return to   normal once the federal spending issues are resolved. Several textile contacts   reported that uncertainty in their raw material markets, exacerbated by the   turmoil in the Middle East, had caused prices in petroleum-based products to   escalate. More broadly, raw materials prices continued to move higher, according   to our latest survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Port-related activity in the District advanced at a moderate pace, although   several contacts noted that the pace of expansion was slower than a year ago.   Exports of raw commodities remained robust, with exports outpacing imports at   most ports. One official reported strong export demand for break freight (e.g.,   autos and construction equipment), as well as soy beans, scrap metal, paper, and   refrigerated commodities. Another port contact stated that the number of   freighters waiting to enter to port to load--mostly coal and grains--was the   highest he had seen in years. High freight capacity kept shipping rates down,   according to one shipper, but fuel costs were becoming a serious concern, even   when those costs could be passed along. Both truck and rail have benefited from   increased intermodal freight coming through the ports, according most contacts,   but the fuel-cost advantage of rail has given that mode an edge over   trucking.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail sales remained anemic in recent   weeks. A store manager at a discount chain department store in central North   Carolina noted, "Sales petered out after early tax refunds were spent," while   the store manager at another discount chain store in Virginia Beach said sales   were "slow but steady." Suppliers' prices rose rapidly for cotton and   petroleum-based fabrics. At a Maryland mall, a department store manager told us   that rising cotton prices were "a big deal," preventing acquisition of inventory   such as clothing, sheets, and towels. An analyst for a major hardware store   chain stated that sales were "a little better," with shoppers spending more but   not on major home improvements. Big-ticket sales weakened, according to surveyed   contacts, primarily in wholesale construction materials and furniture. Vehicle   sales were generally sluggish or unchanged; a dealer in the Tidewater area of   Virginia reported "sales have been stagnant." Another dealer reported that he   was facing restrictions on ordering certain car colors, because those paints   come from Japan; he also noted availability problems with car components   originating in Japan. Retail prices rose at a slightly quicker pace in recent   weeks; a large grocer indicated that his wholesale price increases were being   passed through to consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenues grew more rapidly at services-providing   establishments since our last report. CPAs and tax-preparation services reported   strong seasonal demand. Internet service businesses, as well as travel-related   services providers, also noted higher revenues. A contact at a building   maintenance firm cited a recent uptick in modernization spending, especially   among large hotels, causing increased backlogs at his company. Healthcare   contacts indicated that demand for their services was generally unchanged in   recent weeks, as did business-to-business services such as management   consultants. An exception was freight trucking; contacts with a nationwide   presence stated that business was strengthening and that they were doing some   hiring. The pace of price increases in the sector edged up, according to survey   responses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking activity picked up across the District.   Most bank officials whom we contacted noted a marked increase in interest from   business clients, often to restart projects that had been delayed over the past   two years. Several bankers also reported that their lending had grown from weak   levels at the end of last year. A Virginia banker stated that consumer demand,   while still quite soft, had improved, while a Richmond banker in a relatively   affluent neighborhood cited a spike in equity line usage (often to be used for   pre-sale home renovations). Most commercial bankers reported that small business   lending had strengthened somewhat, with much of the funds going to equipment   upgrades and plant expansions. A bank official in West Virginia reported that   auto dealer inventory financing increased, but overall the bank's loan pipeline   was slack and he was unenthusiastic about loan demand in general. Reports on   mortgage lending activity were mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Real estate activity edged up since our last   report. Several Realtors indicated that sales were picking up gradually and that   markets were more active than a year ago when tax credit programs were still in   place. Most contacts indicated that sales in the low-price range fared much   better than sales in the upper ranges. In contrast, an agent in the D.C. area   stated that sales in the $700 thousand to $900 thousand price range increased   over 80 percent, and sales in the one-million-plus price range were up over 100   percent. While most Realtors indicated that that they had not seen any change in   the proportion of distressed sales, a contact in Greensboro, North Carolina   noticed an increase in foreclosures and an agent in Fredericksburg mentioned   that short sales were still about 50 percent of that market. Realtors throughout   the District noted an increase in foot traffic, but sale price movements varied.   Real estate agents in the D.C. and Greenville, South Carolina areas stated that   prices held steady, while a contact in Greensboro said prices were soft. In   contrast, an agent in Fredericksburg, Virginia reported that sales prices rose   about 10 percent over last year, and an agent in the D.C. area reported upward   price momentum due to lower inventory. He noted that properties in top condition   and priced at market were selling quickly and that recent sales were generating   four to five offers at full price and above.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity improved somewhat since our last assessment.   A Richmond Realtor reported a substantial increase in office leasing (both new   and renewals), and the industrial sector experienced moderate improvements in   absorption, while leasing of retail space held steady. In South Carolina, a   contact noted that a vacant plant in a distressed industrial area had been sold   to a local import business. Additionally, an economic developer for the area   stated that commercial permit activity was increasing both in terms of volume   and amounts. However, foreclosed properties were still an issue in Maryland,   according to a contact there, while another source remarked that available   financing for projects continued to be a problem in the Carolinas. Construction   activity was little changed over the last several months, according to a survey   of construction contractors in the District, although the few reports of at   least some gain in activity slightly outnumbered reports of declines. Most   contractors reported cost increases in a wide variety of commodities, but,   compared to a similar survey at the end of last year, a greater number were able   to pass through the increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets generally strengthened across   most sectors in the Fifth District, with the exception of construction and   retail. Several employment agencies reported somewhat stronger demand for   temporary help in recent weeks, particularly in automotive and other   manufacturing sectors. The branch manager of a temp agency in Raleigh and an   agent in Hickory, North Carolina reported an increase in demand for skilled   workers for the manufacturing and automotive industries. In Charlotte, North   Carolina, an employment agent indicated that hiring was on the rebound and that   his firm would soon add internal recruiters and account managers. Most   recruiters expected rising demand for employees over the next six months.   However, many contacts mentioned that skill levels of applicants often fell   short, despite recent government actions to improve education and training for   displaced workers. According to our latest survey, wages in the retail sector   increased on average, although gains were somewhat less widespread than in our   last report; the pace of wage increases picked up at services firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District hotels, including resorts, reported an   uptick in bookings for April, as well as strong advance bookings for the summer   vacation season. The manager of a resort hotel in the North Carolina Piedmont   region expected a good summer season, and he indicated April bookings were up   slightly year-over-year. Our contact at a resort in western Virginia reported an   increase in dollar volume, year-over-year. He said, "'Staycations' are here for   the long-haul," with many of his advance-booked leisure guests coming from   within a day's drive. A contact on the North Carolina Outer Banks reported that   rentals were up in most categories for the summer ahead, and good spring weather   had boosted April cottage rentals. She stated that people seemed to be feeling a   little better about the economy and were focusing on spending time with family.   A Washington, DC contact reported that early attendance at this year's Cherry   Blossom Festival was above average and that cooler temperatures meant that   blooms would last longer, giving visitors more opportunity to enjoy the cherry   trees in bloom.
