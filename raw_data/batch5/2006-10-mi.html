      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew moderately since the last report. Increases 
  in activity were noted in consumer spending, commercial real estate, tourism, 
  agriculture, mining, and energy. Meanwhile, manufacturing activity was mixed, 
  commercial construction was steady, and residential real estate and construction 
  activity decreased. Labor markets tightened since the last report, and wage 
  increases were moderate. Significant price increases were noted for some building 
  materials, and significant decreases were noted in fuel and lumber.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall consumer spending increased modestly from a year ago. A major Minneapolis-based 
  retailer reported same-store sales up about 3 percent in August compared with 
  a year ago. A Minneapolis area mall manager noted that recent traffic was higher 
  than a year ago, but sales were relatively flat. A solid back-to-school shopping 
  season was reported at another Minneapolis area mall; recent traffic was up 
  2 percent. Cool weather helped boost sales for sweaters and light jackets. A 
  mall manager in Montana noted that sales were very strong in August compared 
  with a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      An auto dealer in eastern Montana reported that sales were up slightly from 
  a year ago. A representative of an auto dealers association in North Dakota 
  noted that sales over the past two months were sluggish compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Late summer and fall tourism activity was up slightly from last year. A Chamber 
  of Commerce representative in northwestern Wisconsin noted strong traffic during 
  a recent autumn event. The fall tourism season is starting to pick up in South 
  Dakota, according to an official; the pheasant hunting season looks promising. 
  A tourism official in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan noted positive reports 
  by tourism-related businesses during August and September. Some lodging operators 
  in northeastern Minnesota noted a slower August compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction activity was steady. A bank director noted that commercial 
  construction was active, although the pace of activity might be slowing. August 
  residential and commercial permits in Rochester, Minn., were down 22 percent 
  in value from a year ago. Developers announced plans for a $14.4 million industrial 
  park in suburban Minneapolis, and other developers announced plans for a $5.2 
  million, 55,000- square-foot fitness center in suburban St. Paul. However, residential 
  construction continued to weaken around the District. A Minneapolis director 
  heard contractors describe activity there as slow. A proposed condominium development 
  plan in St. Paul was delayed, and there is doubt about whether some downtown 
  Minneapolis condo developments will go forward. However, a western North Dakota 
  director described residential construction in his area as robust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate continued to slide. August home sales in Minneapolis-St. 
  Paul were down 27 percent from 2005, with pending sales down 23 percent. Sales 
  were down 10 percent from last year in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; the 
  market for recreational land is the only strong segment there. However, a representative 
  of a Realtors' association in Sioux Falls, S. D. described the market there 
  as on pace with last year's record-breaking levels, with lower priced homes 
  driving the market. The commercial sector stayed strong, however, particularly 
  the Minneapolis industrial market, which saw rising prices, according to an 
  official from a commercial real estate firm. The markets for retail space in 
  North Dakota and Montana are strong. Office vacancies crept up in the Minneapolis 
  and St. Paul central business districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Growth in the manufacturing sector was mixed. An October survey of purchasing 
  managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated slight growth of manufacturing 
  activity in the Dakotas and Minnesota. A contact from a specialty food products 
  company in North Dakota reported strong demand and was expanding workers' overtime 
  hours. In Minnesota, a contact from a manufacturer of parts for the medical 
  and transportation industries reported strong demand, added production, and 
  increased hiring. An industrial machine producer in northwestern Wisconsin noted 
  a slowing down in demand from domestic customers and increased demand from foreign 
  customers. However, due to weak residential construction, two oriented-strand 
  board plants suspended operations in Minnesota. A contact at a lumber mill in 
  northwestern Wisconsin reported sales are "real slow."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. Although 
  oil and gas exploration and production in the District were stable, the alternative 
  energy industry, including wind, biodiesel, and ethanol, continued to expand 
  at a rapid pace. Mining production is at near-capacity across the District. 
  A Montana platinum mine reopened after shutting down due to nearby wildfires. 
  A Minnesota iron-mining official noted that "all systems are go," as production 
  is strong and new mines are in the permitting process.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity increased since the last report. Late summer rains and 
  improved harvest estimates aided farmers. District sugar beet producers are 
  expecting a bumper crop. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that corn 
  and soybean progress in District states is ahead of last year and the five-year 
  average. The corn harvest in Minnesota is expected to come in at a robust 1.1 
  billion bushels. However, District corn and soybean production is projected 
  to decrease from last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets tightened slightly since the last report. A temporary staffing 
  agency survey of Minneapolis-St. Paul companies showed that 36 percent of respondents 
  expect to increase staffing levels during the fourth quarter, while 11 percent 
  expect declines. A year ago, 26 percent expected increases, while 13 percent 
  anticipated decreases. More than half of the 149 employers in Minnesota surveyed 
  by St. Cloud State University's Career Service Center plan to hire new college 
  graduates this year. Construction of an anti-cancer-agent research facility 
  is under way in Minnesota, making room for 100 new research positions. In contrast, 
  a telecommunications company based in Minnesota plans to lay off 225 employees 
  companywide.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases were moderate. Wages for manufacturing workers in District 
  states increased 1.8 percent for the three-month period ended in August compared 
  with a year ago. Workers at five hospitals in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
  recently agreed to a new contract that provides wage increases of 4 percent 
  in each of the first two years and 3 percent in the third, and employer contributions 
  to health insurance premiums will increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Significant price increases were noted in some building materials, and decreases 
  were noted in fuel and lumber. Prices for copper and brass mill shapes, steel 
  mill products, asphalt, and wire and cable were notably higher than a year earlier. 
  Meanwhile, gasoline prices decreased since the last report. In Minnesota, gasoline 
  prices toward the end of September were 49 cents per gallon lower than a year 
  ago and 75 cents lower than a month earlier. Regional prices for diesel fuel 
  were 23 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. Recent plywood and softwood 
  lumber prices were also down from last year.
