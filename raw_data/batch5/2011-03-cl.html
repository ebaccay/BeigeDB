      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, economic activity in the Fourth District continued to expand at a   modest pace. Manufacturers reported some improvement in new orders and   production. Information received from retailers and auto dealers on the   post-holiday shopping season was generally positive. Energy production and   freight transport volume were stable. Residential and nonresidential   construction remained sluggish. And while demand for business loans showed some   signs of a pickup, consumer borrowing was weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising payrolls were limited to the manufacturing and retailing sectors.   Staffing-firm representatives noted some growth in the number of new job   openings, with vacancies concentrated in health care, manufacturing, and   professional business services. Wage pressures continue to be contained. Reports   of increasing prices for commodities and steel were widespread. As a result,   manufacturers and retailers felt mounting pressure to pass through some of their   rising input costs to their customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District factories indicate   continued improvement in new orders and production during the past six weeks.   Any declines were attributed to seasonal factors. Compared with year-ago levels,   production was generally higher, with many of our contacts experiencing low   double-digit increases. Manufacturers are fairly optimistic and expect at least   modest growth during 2011. Steel producers and service centers reported that   shipping volume rose, with shipments being driven by energy-related, auto, and   heavy equipment industries. Looking forward, expectations call for continued   growth through at least the first half of 2011. District auto production showed   a moderate increase during January on a month-over-month basis. Compared with a   year ago, domestic auto makers showed a substantial rise in production, while   foreign nameplates posted a slight decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of our contacts indicated that capacity utilization rates continue   to trend higher. Inventories remain close to targeted levels. The number of   manufacturers who expect to increase capital spending during 2011 has increased   significantly since our last report. Reasons for the increase include stronger   cash flows and a willingness to go ahead with projects that had been postponed   during 2010. Prices for metal and agricultural commodities and steel increased,   while the cost of most other raw materials has been relatively stable. Many of   our contacts reported passing rising input prices through to their customers.   Most manufacturers said that they have expanded their payrolls slightly since   our last survey, and they expect to continue hiring at the same pace in the near   term. Wage pressures are contained. Companies continue to reverse wage/salary   cuts and restore payments to 401K plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New home construction was generally flat at a   low level during the past six weeks, with purchases mainly in the move-up buyer   categories. A few builders noted that most of their revenues now come from   remodeling work. On a year-over-year basis, sales were mainly lower. Contractors   expect construction to remain sluggish through at least the first half of 2011.   List prices of new homes and discounting have shown little change, while some   upward pressure on the cost of building materials was reported. Little movement   was seen in land positions or spec inventories. We heard many reports of   subcontractors struggling to stay in business due to very thin margins. General   contractors continue to work with lean crews, and no hiring is expected in the   near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussions with nonresidential builders drew mixed responses, with a   majority of our contacts reporting weaker activity than a year ago. However, the   number of inquiries has picked up modestly since our last report. Backlogs   remain reasonably healthy, though two builders noted that their backlogs are   being depleted at a rapid pace. Half of our contacts do not expect any near term   improvement in business conditions, while others are much more positive. One   builder noted that he is beginning to notice a sense of urgency to expand on the   part of some of his industrial customers. We heard widespread reports of   increased prices for building materials, with most contractors expecting   continued upward pressure. These price increases are eroding already narrow   margins. Two general contractors noted that they reduced payrolls and may lay   off additional employees if business does not improve. Subcontractors continue   to cope with very difficult industry conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from retailers indicate that   post-holiday sales were on or ahead of plan and were generally higher than   year-ago levels. Cold-weather apparel is selling particularly well, and   purchases of select high-ticket items were better than expected. A few of our   contacts reported that the low- to mid-market segments still face considerable   stress. Looking forward to the second quarter of 2011, retailers expect   transactions to rise on a year-over-year basis, with several anticipating low to   mid-single digit gains. We heard several reports about increasing prices from   vendors, which were attributed to a rise in the cost of agricultural commodities   and labor issues in Asia. Accordingly, some retailers are considering raising   their prices, especially for apparel and food products. Inventories are in line   with demand. Some of our contacts plan to increase capital spending during 2011   for new stores, distribution centers, and e-business expansion, with a   corresponding rise in payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most auto dealers reported that new vehicle purchases dropped slightly in   January when compared with December levels, while on a year-over-year basis,   vehicle purchases rose moderately. Looking forward, dealers expect 2011 sales   trends to improve over those seen last year. A few of our contacts noted an   increase in leasing activity. Reports on new car inventories were mixed. Used   vehicle inventories are somewhat lean, with upward pressure on prices. We heard   two reports about banks beginning to loosen credit requirements for vehicle   purchases. Dealers are waiting for more details from automakers before   committing to capital investments in their facilities, with some dealers   reporting that they are better prepared financially to make these investments.   Little change in staffing levels is expected during the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      In general, bankers reported that commercial loan   demand was stable or showed modest growth since our last survey. Some bankers   commented that demand is strongest from health care providers, small   manufacturers, and energy companies. On the consumer side, conventional loan   demand remains soft, although a few of our contacts told us that they are seeing   a modest pickup. Direct and indirect auto lending continues to show strength,   while reports on the use of home equity lines of credit were mixed. Interest   rates for business and consumer credit were generally stable. Most of our   contacts said that activity in the residential mortgage market has slowed   (refinancings and new-purchase originations) due to rising interest rates and   seasonal factors. Core deposits continue to grow, with most of the growth   occurring in nonmaturing products. The credit quality of businesses and consumer   applicants was characterized as stable to improving, while delinquency rates   were trending down across most portfolios. Staffing levels have shown little   change during the past few weeks. Selective hiring is expected during 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports indicate that oil and gas output from   conventional wells was fairly steady during the past six weeks, with little   change expected in the near term. Leasing activity for Marcellus and Utica shale   in eastern Ohio continues to expand, but few drilling permits have been issued.   Spot prices for natural gas were flat, while wellhead prices paid to independent   oil producers showed a modest increase. Coal production has been fairly steady   since our last report, with little change anticipated in the near term. Prices   for steam and metallurgical coal rose slightly. We heard several reports of a   small rise in equipment and material costs, which was attributed to increasing   commodity prices. Payrolls are expected to remain at current levels during the   next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on freight transport volume were   mixed. Several contacts said that January's seasonal volume decline was greater   than expected due to unusually severe winter weather. Looking ahead, carriers   expect that markets will continue to recover and that sales growth in 2011 will   be somewhat stronger than year-ago levels. Almost all of our contacts reported   rising prices for diesel fuel, some of which were passed through to customers   via a surcharge. Nonetheless, rising fuel prices continue to erode margins.   Capital outlays are expected to rise during 2011 to replace aging equipment.   However, the amount spent will be dependent on the availability of financing.   Hiring thus far has been for replacement only, but two of our contacts noted   that they are considering hiring additional drivers to add capacity. Slight wage   pressures are emerging due to a growing problem with driver turnover and a   tightening of the driver pool.
