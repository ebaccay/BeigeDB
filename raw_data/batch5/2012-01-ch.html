      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of growth of economic activity in the Seventh District picked up in   late November and December. Contacts were generally optimistic about the   economic outlook for 2012, but many also expressed concern about potential   weakness in demand from abroad, particularly from China and Europe. Consumer   spending increased, while business spending was steady. Manufacturing production   increased. Construction was again subdued, although conditions in real estate   markets improved slightly. Overall, credit conditions were little changed from   the last reporting period. Wholesale price increases slowed, but there was some   further pass-through to the retail level. Corn, soybean, and cattle prices   increased, while milk and hog prices decreased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to increase   in late November and December. Compared to last year's holiday season, store   traffic volumes were up significantly while nominal spending was up only   moderately as consumers reportedly were making more shopping trips and   aggressively bargain hunting to obtain the lowest prices. Several contacts noted   an increase this year in online shopping and a greater prevalence of flexible   and low-cost shipping options. Traditional holiday retail items such as   electronics, sporting goods, hobby items, music, books, toys, and apparel all   sold well. Contacts additionally reported more spending on luxury items this   year. Auto sales increased since the last reporting period. Dealers reported   that showroom traffic volumes were up, and many expected sales to continue to   improve further in 2012. Importantly, contacts cited a continued boost from   replacement demand in light of the record high average age of vehicles in the   U.S.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending was steady in late   November and December. Contacts reported that inventory levels were generally   in-line with sales, although inventory rebuilding continued in the auto industry   in the aftermath of the supply chain disruptions earlier in the year. Capital   investment plans were largely unchanged, with several manufacturers moving ahead   with planned increases in capacity. Hiring remained selective, but the majority   of contacts indicated plans to increase employment next year. A staffing firm   noted slower growth in billable hours and below-average seasonal hiring in   office and clerical positions. However, they also indicated that permanent   placement activity continued to increase for industrial positions. Manufacturers   again cited difficulties in attracting job candidates with ideal skill sets in   technical fields such as engineering. Many of these firms indicated that they   would rather postpone hiring a candidate until economic conditions improve to a   point that would clearly warrant them doing so.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction activity was   subdued in late November and early December, but there was some improvement in   overall real estate conditions. Builder showroom traffic picked up slightly,   although in general residential real estate market conditions remained depressed   as foreclosed properties continued to put downward pressure on prices and   single-family construction remained at low levels. In contrast, multi-family   construction continued to be an area of strength. The number of residential   leases being signed increased from the previous reporting period and rents rose.   Nonresidential construction was also up moderately with the strongest gains in   Class A properties. Contacts noted greater demand for both industrial and   healthcare facilities. In addition, commercial real estate conditions improved   slightly with commercial rents stabilizing and a decline in the available amount   of sublease space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing production increased in late   November and December. Contacts in the manufacturing sector were more optimistic   for 2012 given the pace at which their order books are filling through the first   quarter. Auto production increased over the reporting period. However, some   contacts still are concerned about the ability to ramp up production much   further over the near-term because auto suppliers may be approaching capacity   constraints. Demand for heavy equipment remained strong, led by robust activity   in the energy and agriculture sectors. Exports also continued to be a source of   strength, although slower growth in China and Europe was noted to have held back   sales at some firms. In the steel sector, inventories at service centers remain   near desired levels, and given the continued strength in the auto, energy,   machinery, and mining sectors, steel production was expected to increase in the   first quarter of 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Credit conditions were little changed   during the reporting period. Corporate funding costs, while variable, were   largely unchanged on balance. Liquidity remained relatively scarce in the high   yield debt markets. Banking contacts indicated that business loan demand   continued to be subdued, with the exception of some large multinational mining   corporations. Businesses utilization of credit lines was only up a bit. Because   lenders continue to see their clients' balance sheets growing stronger, they   speculated that uncertainty about future business conditions was restraining the   demand for credit. However, contacts also noted that some larger manufacturers   are making loans to sub-tier suppliers out of retained earnings, thus reducing   these suppliers' typical demand for credit from financial institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Cost pressures eased in late November   and early December. While pressure on costs remained from commodities such as   steel and food, it moderated significantly for cotton and energy goods. Pass   through of elevated material costs to consumers continued. Wage pressures   remained moderate, with contacts noting that annual increases in wage and   non-wage benefits were largely in-line with last year's increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Farm income for 2011 was higher than in 2010;   and farmland values and cash rental rates were reported to be higher once again.   After falling initially during the reporting period, corn and soybean prices   rose in the last half of December. More generally, crop prices fell during the   harvest period. However, most crop deliveries involved sales at pre-harvest   prices, as many end users found it necessary to ensure sufficient supplies prior   to the harvest. In contrast, for those who didn't pre-sell, more of their crop   ended up being put into storage. Milk and hog prices fell during the reporting   period, while cattle prices increased. Still, export demand helped keep prices   for both dairy and meat products higher than they were at the end of 2010. Input   costs have risen for the coming planting season.
