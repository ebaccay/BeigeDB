      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic growth in the Second District has remained sluggish since the last   report. While it is too early to assess the full effects of Hurricane Irene,   initial reports suggest widespread disruptions and local pockets of more extreme   stress from flooding and power outages. Transportation and other infrastructure   apparently sustained limited damage. Prior to the hurricane, business contacts   in the manufacturing sector noted steady to weakening activity. Retail sales   were reported to be up modestly from a year ago in recent weeks, while tourism   activity has remained strong. Commercial real estate markets have shown some   signs of improvement since the last report: both office and industrial markets   have been steady to slightly stronger. The residential purchase market has been   stable, while the rental market has continued to strengthen; new home   construction remains very sluggish. Finally, bankers report reduced demand for   consumer and commercial &amp; industrial loans, widespread increases in   household delinquency rates, and some tightening in credit standards for   commercial &amp; industrial loans and commercial mortgages.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Non-auto retail sales continued to run   close to or slightly ahead of plan in July, with same-store sales on par with or   slightly ahead of a year earlier. Most retailers indicate modest slowing in the   first three weeks of August, although one major mall in western New York State   notes some firming in sales activity in August, following a sluggish July.   Widespread disruptions from Hurricane Irene across much of the District are   likely to adversely affect sales tallies for the full month, but replacement of   consumers' water-damaged property is expected to boost sales in September.   Retail prices are reported to be mostly stable, though some retailers are   implementing moderate increases on prices of cotton-based merchandise to counter   sharply rising costs. Inventories are generally reported to be in good   shape.
       </p>
       <p>
        Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales weakened in July and were   mixed in early August. Rochester-area dealers note continued weakness in new   vehicle sales in recent weeks, which have been running somewhat below 2010   levels, reflecting continued Japan-related supply disruptions and a lack of   incentives. However, dealers in the Buffalo area report some firming in sales   activity in early August, following a sluggish July. Auto dealers in both areas   indicate that used car sales remain strong and that used car prices continue to   be buoyed by strong demand and lean inventories. Auto-industry contacts note   that both retail and wholesale credit conditions are good.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumer confidence remains mired at low levels. Siena College reports that   consumer confidence among New York State residents slipped to a 10-month low in   July, with declines in both upstate and the New York City area. The Conference   Board indicates that consumer confidence among residents of the Middle Atlantic   states (NY, NJ, PA) was little changed in July and was near the middle of its   range over the past year. Tourism activity in New York City remained robust in   July and early August. Manhattan hotels report that total revenue per room was   running 7 to 8 percent ahead of a year ago in July and appeared to be up roughly   10 percent in August (prior to the hurricane). Most of the increase has come   from rising room rates, as occupancy rates have been holding relatively steady   at high levels. Broadway theaters also report sturdy gains in both attendance   and revenues since the last report, despite a mid-July lull. Theaters closed for   most of the final weekend in August because of Hurricane Irene, but were due to   reopen the following Monday. Businesses in the popular vacation areas along the   Long Island and New Jersey shores were widely affected by hurricane-related   evacuations.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Construction and Real Estate
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Residential construction and   home sales have remained sluggish but generally steady since the last report,   while there has been further improvement in the rental market. Overall, prices   of existing homes have edged up in recent months in many areas but are still   down slightly from a year ago across most of the region. Buffalo-area Realtors   report that market conditions remained weak in July and early August, with the   median selling price little changed from a year earlier, but that a recent   increase in pending sales suggests some recent firming in market conditions. An   authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that a large overhang of   distressed properties continues to weigh down the market but that the processing   of foreclosures is now resuming; this is expected to lower reported transaction   prices, on average, but increase sales activity and gradually reduce the   inventory. New construction activity is very low and largely concentrated in the   multi-family (rental) segment. A major appraisal firm reports a   more-than-typical seasonal drop-off in activity in New York City's co-op and   condo market in August; some of the recent softness is deemed to reflect concern   about the city's financial sector. Still, the markets in Manhattan and nearby   Brooklyn are reported to be holding up relatively well, buoyed, in part, by   foreign buyers paying cash. New York City's rental market has shown continued   strength: the inventory of available units is down moderately, and rents on new   leases continue to climb and are up 5 to 8 percent over the past   year.
       </p>
       Commercial real estate markets have improved modestly since the last   report. Office markets were steady to somewhat stronger in July and the first   half of August, as vacancy rates declined noticeably in the Buffalo and   Rochester metro areas and modestly in Manhattan and on Long Island. However,   vacancies continued to edge up in northern New Jersey, and Westchester and   Fairfield counties. Industrial vacancy rates edged down in most areas, while   asking rents were little changed. Northern New Jersey's industrial vacancy rate   reached its lowest level in two years; small declines were reported on Long   Island and in Westchester and Fairfield counties.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Other Business Activity
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Reports from business contacts   point to some weakening in general business activity and steady to weakening   conditions in the labor market. A major New York City employment agency reports   that hiring activity has been unusually slow in August but remains cautiously   optimistic that recruitment will pick up after Labor Day; financial firms, in   particular, have become more hesitant and even hiring for compliance jobs has   slowed. Separately, a contact in the securities industry reports that widespread   layoffs are planned across the industry (though not entirely in New York City)   and not all the weakness is related to the current market turmoil. There   continues to be some hiring in compliance and technology, but layoffs now exceed   hiring, on net.
       </p>
       <p>
        More broadly, non-manufacturing business contacts across the   District report that business conditions have deteriorated in recent weeks and   indicate waning optimism about the near-term business outlook. They continue to   report steady to rising employment levels, with a majority expecting employment   to level off in the months ahead. Non-manufacturing firms report that cost   pressures remain fairly widespread, though somewhat less so than in recent   months; further increases in input costs are expected in the months ahead.   Selling prices, however, remain steady.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturing firms in the District report that business activity weakened   moderately in July and early August and that price pressures have continued to   recede, based on the latest Empire State Manufacturing Survey. Contacts report   steady employment levels, and expect this to continue over the next six months.   Overall, though, manufacturers are now less optimistic about the near term   outlook than they have been in quite some time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Financial Developments
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Bankers indicate weakening demand   for consumer loans and commercial &amp; industrial loans, but an increase in the   demand for residential mortgages, as well as for refinancing. Bankers report   tightening their standards for commercial mortgages and commercial &amp;   industrial loans but no change in credit standards for consumer loans and   residential mortgages. Respondents report a decrease in spreads of loan rates   over costs of funds for all loan categories--most notably commercial mortgages.   Respondents also indicated a decrease in the average deposit rate. Finally,   bankers report increased delinquency rates on all categories of loans except   commercial &amp; industrial loans. The increase in delinquency was most   widespread for consumer loans where 41 percent of respondents indicated   increases in delinquency rates and only 7 percent indicated decreases.
