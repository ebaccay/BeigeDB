      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to expand at a moderate pace   during the reporting period of late February through the end of March. Despite   higher energy prices, overall price pressures for final goods and services   remained modest, as did wage gains. Sales of retail items and demand for   business and consumer services rose further. District manufacturing activity   increased on net. Demand was robust for agricultural producers but remained   uneven for providers of energy resources. Activity in District housing markets   strengthened modestly but remained lackluster on balance, and demand for   nonresidential real estate was largely unchanged. Contacts from financial   institutions reported small increases in overall loan demand and slight   improvements in credit quality and availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation for most final goods and   services remained subdued during the reporting period, with the notable   exception of gasoline. While contacts noted an increase in the prices of oil and   selected other commodities, resulting cost increases generally were absorbed in   profit margins rather than pass-through to final prices. Restaurant prices were   an exception, with notable increases reported. Looking ahead, contacts in   general expect prices for their products to hold largely stable or increase   slightly during the second half of the year compared with the first half.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were quite modest overall, held down by high levels of   unemployment and limited demand for new workers. However, wage gains remained   pronounced for highly skilled workers in information technology fields, and   significant gains were also reported for experienced workers in some segments of   manufacturing. The reports suggested that wage gains are likely to remain   limited going forward, as most contacts plan to engage in only modest hiring for   the foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales continued to   improve. Discount chains reported modest increases in sales, while traditional   department stores noted stronger gains, particularly in the luxury segments of   the market. Demand continued to improve for retailers of home furnishings and   major appliances. By contrast, sales remained largely flat for grocers. Sales of   new automobiles continued to strengthen, with high gas prices spurring   especially strong growth for fuel-efficient vehicles. Similarly, demand for used   vehicles remained robust.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business and consumer services strengthened further on balance.   Sales continued to expand at a moderate pace for providers of technology   services, and contacts anticipate growth will pick up in the second half of the   year. Demand has improved in the radio and television broadcasting industries.   By contrast, demand for professional services was largely flat, as was demand   for health-care services. Sales activity was reported to be up somewhat for   restaurants and other food-service providers. Activity in the District's travel   and tourism industry picked up further, with contacts in Hawaii and Southern   California noting ongoing gains in visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity rose a bit   on net during the reporting period of late February through the end of March.   Makers of commercial aircraft and parts saw limited new orders, but an extensive   order backlog kept production rates near capacity. Manufacturers of   semiconductors and other technology products reported some firming in new orders   and indicated that they expect demand growth to pick up further in coming   months. Capacity utilization rates continued to hold largely stable for   petroleum refiners as weak domestic gasoline demand was offset by strong foreign   demand for distillate products. Production activity was largely unchanged for   metal fabricators, but demand remained quite depressed for producers of wood   products. Food processors saw solid growth in orders and sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for   agricultural products and mined metals remained strong, while extraction   activity of natural resources used for energy production was uneven. Final sales   and orders were robust for a broad range of crop and livestock products, and   recent precipitation has eased concerns in parts of the District about drought   during the upcoming growing season. Contacts noted increases in the costs of   some inputs, such as fertilizer. Expanding activity in the mining sector   continued to be supported by high prices for a variety of precious metals and   metallic elements used for specialized industrial purposes. Mild winter weather   continued to tamp down demand for natural gas, prompting additional declines in   extraction activity, while elevated price levels and robust foreign demand   spurred further increases in oil extraction.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District home demand   improved slightly but remained weak on balance, and demand for commercial real   estate was largely unchanged. Sales of new and existing homes continued to   improve modestly in certain areas of the District, although the pace remained   quite lackluster overall. Furthermore, despite relatively low interest rates,   contacts noted that tight financing terms more generally held down the pace of   sales. With inventories of available homes still very high, new construction   activity stayed at depressed levels and home prices remained largely flat.   Demand for commercial real estate continued to be weak overall, as reflected in   elevated vacancy rates and limited leasing activity for office and industrial   space in many parts of the District. On the other hand, growth in the technology   sector has led to rapid absorption of commercial space in certain locales, such   as the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. As a result, increased construction   activity for new office space is expected for these areas over the next twelve   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported   that overall loan demand rose modestly since the prior reporting period, and   credit quality and availability improved slightly. While businesses generally   remained highly cautious about their capital spending plans, the volume of new   commercial and industrial loans edged up as businesses continued to pursue   targeted investments geared towards increasing productivity. On the consumer   side, demand for credit was largely unchanged. Credit quality improved slightly,   with reports indicating a general decline in loan delinquencies. Although   lending standards have remained relatively restrictive for most types of   business and consumer loans, contacts reported modest improvement in overall   credit availability. The reports also indicated that competition among lenders   has been creating downward pressure on rates and fees for well-qualified small   and medium-sized businesses.
