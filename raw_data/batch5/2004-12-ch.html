      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
      <p>
       The Seventh District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace from late 

  October through mid-November. Consumer spending remained relatively soft, but 

  business spending continued to pick up. Construction and real estate activity 

  was largely the same as at the time of our last report. Manufacturing continued 

  to be robust, with contacts reporting further gains in production, new orders, 

  and backlogs. Bankers said that demand increased slightly for both household 

  and business loans. High input costs persisted, but retail price pressures were 

  largely subdued. Agriculture prospects remained strong, with bumper corn and 

  soybean harvests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending remained relatively soft from late October through mid-November. 

  Retailers generally indicated that sales nationwide were coming in at the lower 

  end of their expectations, with the Midwest softer than other regions. However, 

  some said that store traffic and sales of seasonal merchandise picked up as 

  temperatures cooled. Despite stronger job growth and higher consumer confidence, 

  merchants' expectations for the holiday shopping season remained somewhat cautious. 

  Retail inventories were said to be in line with sales plans. Many restaurants, 

  from quick-casual to high-end, noted stronger sales during the reporting period. 

  One property manager noted that restaurants were benefiting from a general upswing 

  in shopping center traffic. District auto dealers said that light vehicle sales 

  were relatively soft in early November, which was in line with expectations, 

  and that inventories were slightly high. Once again, tourism and related spending 

  was reported to be a bit above year-earlier levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business spending continued to increase and more firms appeared to be hiring. 

  Many businesses reportedly boosted outlays for production machinery, office 

  equipment, and computers. Still, contacts again suggested that a large portion 

  of capital outlays was devoted to replacing outdated or worn equipment and/or 

  cost-saving technologies, rather than expanding productive capacity. Business 

  travel and advertising continued to rise modestly. With regard to hiring, one 

  large temporary help firm indicated that new orders increased significantly 

  in October and early November after falling off in September. This firm, and 

  others, noted that demand for temporary workers was strong across industry and 

  occupational categories. In addition, temp-to-permanent placement fees continued 

  to rise. Outside of temporary help firms, reports of additional permanent hiring 

  became more frequent, particularly from manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction/real estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On balance, there was little discernible change in real estate and construction 

  activity in recent months, as some slowing in housing markets was offset by 

  a slight strengthening on the nonresidential side. Though reports were mixed, 

  Realtors and builders generally indicated that housing markets remained strong 

  even though sales were a little slower than earlier in the year. However, a 

  contact with one builders' association suggested that most homebuilders were 

  expecting mortgage interest rates to rise next year, heightening uncertainty 

  among many of them. Commercial construction and real estate activity continued 

  to increase slightly. Despite recent gains in office markets, contacts still 

  described it as "a tenants' market," with leases containing higher-than-normal 

  improvement allowances and rent abatements.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity continued to increase. Producers of heavy equipment (construction, 

  agricultural, and mining) again reported considerable ongoing strength in production, 

  new orders, and backlogs. One contact suggested that tax incentives set to expire 

  at the end of the year may be pulling ahead orders for heavy equipment. New 

  orders for heavy trucks were "at extremely strong levels" and production was 

  constrained by shortages of engines and other parts. Machine tool makers said 

  that new orders increased further from very high levels. Shipments of cement 

  and gypsum wallboard continued to rise, and industry contacts said that some 

  firms had added capacity, or planned future additions, to keep up with demand. 

  Some specialty steel products were said to be in short supply. More generally, 

  however, demand for domestically produced steel eased somewhat recently, due 

  in large part to an increase in imports and softening demand from the auto industry. 

  Light vehicle sales nationwide were said to be "tepid" in early November, and 

  inventories were rising again. As a result, one producer indicated that fourth-quarter 

  production schedules probably will be cut.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking/finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On balance, lending activity increased slightly from our last report. On the 

  household side, some lenders reported an uptick in mortgage loan applications 

  as long-term interest rates remained historically low. There were no changes 

  reported on standards and terms for household loans, and credit quality continued 

  to improve. Demand for business loans increased slightly. One large bank reported 

  that its October increase in commercial loan volumes was one of the strongest 

  this year. In addition, commercial credit line usage increased. Still, overall 

  lending remained well below expectations. There were no reported changes on 

  standards and terms for business loans, and lenders said that credit quality 

  was good and largely unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices/costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports of higher input costs persisted and wages continued to increase at a 

  slightly faster pace, but retail price pressures remained largely subdued. Contacts 

  reported that prices for some materials were decreasing. Notably, steel prices 

  were reported to have declined from relatively high levels, and lumber prices 

  also fell in recent months, alleviating cost pressures on homebuilders. Still, 

  many materials prices remained elevated. The number of firms that were able 

  to pass higher input costs along to their business customers continued to rise, 

  although the price increases appeared modest. Some restaurants were said to 

  be raising menu prices to offset higher food costs. Still, price increases for 

  final consumer goods remained largely contained.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Harvest was nearing completion in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa, but still lagged 

  in Michigan and Wisconsin, especially for corn. Corn and soybean harvests for 

  most District states were likely to approach or set record highs, and concerns 

  about storage of the bumper crops persisted. Precipitation replenished depleted 

  soil moisture levels in parts of the District, but also delayed field work and 

  boosted the moisture content of grain stored outside. Fertilizer prices have 

  increased substantially which, along with higher fuel costs, have tempered gains 

  in farm income, even as government payments provided a boost. Soybean rust, 

  recently discovered in the South, has become a major concern in the District, 

  with planting decisions likely to heavily favor corn over soybeans next year. 

  Livestock producers have benefited from lower feed costs and continued to make 

  a profit.
