      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity expanded modestly  in the Third District in October and early November. Manufacturers, on balance,  reported slight increases in new orders and shipments. Retailers generally  reported somewhat better sales growth in early November than in October. Auto  sales remained slow, and below the year-ago level. Overall bank lending has  been rising, with better growth in business lending than in consumer and real  estate lending. Residential real estate sales remained well off the pace set  last year and earlier this year, and home building continued to decline.  Commercial building occupancy and rents have been rising, but building prices  have eased down and leasing activity has slowed since mid-year. Firms reporting  on labor costs generally noted a continuing trend of moderate increase in  wages, but they continued to report large increases in health care benefits  costs. Firms reported increases in input costs and output prices in November,  and some noted that prices were rising for an increasing number of imported  goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District  firms generally foresee continued growth, but optimistic views are less  prevalent than they were earlier this fall. Manufacturers expect increases in  demand for their products, on balance, but the number forecasting increases has  declined since a month ago. Retailers generally expect sales for the Christmas  shopping period to increase from a year ago, but only modestly. Auto dealers  generally do not expect the sales rate to strengthen. Bankers anticipate slow  expansion in overall lending, with gains coming largely from commercial and  industrial lending while consumer and real estate lending growth slows. Home  builders and residential real estate agents expect sales to remain weak through  the winter, and they are not certain that sales will improve appreciably next  spring. Contacts in commercial real estate anticipate near steady demand for  office and industrial space, although they believe leasing activity will not  increase significantly unless employment growth in the region accelerates.
      <br/>
      <strong>
      </strong>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District  manufacturers, on balance, reported only small increases in shipments and new  orders in November. Around one-third of the manufacturers surveyed noted  increases and nearly as many noted decreases. Increases appeared to be  concentrated in a few sectors. Printing firms and producers of food products  and textiles reported gains; in most other manufacturing sectors shipments and  orders were off for the month. For the Third District manufacturing sector as a  whole order backlogs declined from October to November and delivery times  decreased.  Typical comments from Third  District manufacturers are that "business is really being hurt by the  residential construction slowdown," but "export business has been strong."
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the  Third District manufacturing sector is positive, although not as strongly  optimistic as it had been through most of this year. Around forty percent of  the firms contacted for this report expect increases in new orders and  shipments over the next six months, and twenty percent expect decreases.  Manufacturing firms in the region plan to increase capital spending during the  next six months, on balance, but the number of firms that expect to spend more  only slightly exceeds the number that expect to spend less.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District  reported that sales growth improved in early November following scant gains in  October.  Merchants said the turn to  colder weather boosted sales of winter apparel and that new consumer electronic  products also sold well. However, there was some variation among types of  stores. Early markdowns of some product lines at discount stores gave their  total sales a boost, but some specialty stores saw sales growth falter.  Retailers expect sales for the Christmas shopping period to increase moderately  from a year ago. Although most of the store executives contacted for this  report believe "consumers have the capacity to spend when they're motivated,"  as one retailer phrased it, merchants in the region expect strong gains only  for sales of electronics, such as flat panel televisions and personal  computers. They expect sales of other merchandise lines to move up only  slightly, if at all, for the fourth quarter of this year compared with the same  period last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the region  generally reported slow sales rates, especially for sport utility vehicles.  Overall sales remained below the year-ago level, and most of the dealers  surveyed for this report do not expect improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding  loans at Third District banks rose in October and early November.  Commercial bank lending officers contacted  for this report generally indicated that the increase was stronger for  commercial and industrial loans, mainly to middle-market firms, than for  personal and real estate loans. They indicated that credit card lending has  been rising moderately. Banks and other financial companies engaged in  residential mortgage lending reported a large shift toward conforming mortgages  and away from sub-prime and jumbo mortgages. Most bank contacts indicated that  asset quality overall has weakened slightly in the past few months. Some  bankers said repayment rates on credit card debt have slowed and delinquencies  have risen.  Delinquencies have also  increased on mortgage debt, and foreclosures have risen. Looking ahead, bankers  generally foresee slow growth in overall lending. They expect mortgage and  personal lending to move up slightly, at best, and most expect growth in  business lending to continue to move up at around its current pace, although  some banks noted that their "pipeline is low" for new loans to businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential  real estate activity continued to be very slow in October and early November,  according to home builders and real estate agents contacted for this  report.  Builders continue to make price  reductions, but have not been able to boost sales.  Builders also reported continuing high rates  of cancellations, and some builders noted that tightened mortgage lending  standards had eliminated some buyers who had contracted for new homes.  As sales have declined builders in the region  have stopped work on several projects and laid off workers.  Residential real estate agents also reported  a slow pace of sales, especially in the region's resort areas that had been  very active until mid-year.  Although  real estate agents said price appreciation was still positive, they indicated  that very few house are being sold at listed prices.  One agent said that "there are no more  multiple offers" for houses and he has "price discussions" regularly with  sellers whose houses are on the market for more than a few weeks. Contacts  among builders and real estate agents expect sales to remain flat well into  next year, and the most optimistic expect any spring pickup to be slight.  According to one agent "the glory days are  over," and a builder said "the pipeline for next year is anemic."
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate  firms report that office vacancy rates have declined and rents have increased in  most office markets in the Third District in the past few months.  However, they noted that leasing activity has  decreased and building prices have edged down.   Construction of educational and health care facilities has been steady  or rising throughout the region, but construction of commercial buildings has  slowed. Nevertheless, contacts in commercial real estate said there are plans  for new buildings that could be acted on next year if the region's supply of  large blocks of office space continues to trend down and employment growth  improves.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of  increases in input costs and output prices from Third District business  contacts were about as prevalent in November as they were in October.  Manufacturers noted increases in prices of food products, chemicals, and  machinery, but they reported some declines in prices of lumber and  transportation equipment. Firms in a range of industries reported increases in  energy and transportation costs. Retailers noted spreading price increases for  imported goods. Most of the firms reporting on employment costs in November  indicated a continuing trend of moderate wage increases, but several firms  noted that increases in health care costs continued to be large.
