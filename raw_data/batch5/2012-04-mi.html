      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew at a solid pace since the last report. Strength   was noted in consumer spending, professional services, construction,   manufacturing, energy and mining, and agriculture. Residential real estate had   an unexpectedly large increase in sales activity. Warm weather slowed winter   tourism activity. Hiring activity outpaced layoffs since the last report. Wage   increases were moderate, and price increases were generally subdued.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued   to expand moderately. Same-store sales at a Minnesota-based retailer increased 7   percent in February compared with a year ago. February sales at a Montana mall   were up about 10 percent over last year; remodeling activity was strong for new   stores and expansions. March sales were up over 5 percent compared with a year   earlier at a North Dakota mall. However, a Minnesota-based hair salon plans to   close some of its stores. A Minnesota auto dealer reported that mild weather   depressed service and vehicle sales during January and February, but auto sales   bounced back in March. In addition, higher gasoline prices don't seem to be   influencing buying decisions away from SUVs and light trucks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lack of snow and warm temperatures slowed winter tourism in a number of   areas; however, late-season snow perked up activity in some places. Enough snow   fell in northwestern Wisconsin during February to hold the annual American   Birkebeiner cross-country ski race, bringing thousands of visitors to the area.   Western South Dakota received late-season snow, which enabled a strong finish   for snowmobiling and downhill skiing. A ski resort in Montana reported that   visits and revenue were up from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The continued warm weather   aided construction activity. The value of commercial building permits in the   Sioux Falls, S.D., area was up in February from a year earlier. The value and   number of new commercial permits increased in Fargo, N.D., during the first two   months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011. Residential construction   increased from a year ago. The value of residential building permits increased   significantly in the Sioux Falls area in February. The number of single-family   building permits increased in Minnesota in January 2012, compared with January   2011. Several new multifamily projects were planned for the Minneapolis area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate market activity increased. A commercial broker in   Minneapolis noted more leasing activity, especially for class A space.   Residential real estate had an unexpectedly large increase in sales activity.   Home sales in February were up 23 percent from the same period a year ago in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and the inventory of homes for sale was down 27   percent. However, median sales prices dropped slightly. In the Sioux Falls area,   February home sales were up 5 percent and inventory was down 7 percent relative   to a year ago. A broker noted that lower-priced homes saw an investor "feeding   frenzy," with properties selling in a few days with multiple offers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity at professional business services firms   increased slightly since the last report. An accountant noted that this tax   season was busier and that many firms saw an increase in earnings in 2011   compared with 2010. A bank director from Montana noted that law firms were   experiencing mixed activity and that firms specializing in petro-chemical and   environmental engineering were seeing increased activity, while mechanical and   structural engineering activity was flat to down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded. A survey   of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) found that   manufacturing activity in Minnesota and the Dakotas increased in March. A   manufacturer based in northwestern Wisconsin announced plans to build a   production plant. A mill in Minnesota will begin a $170 million conversion from   producing pulp for paper mills to producing cellulose for textiles. A brewery in   Minnesota is expanding its operations. In contrast, a manufacturer of   recreational vehicles in South Dakota has halted production and may not reopen.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors continued at strong levels. Oil and gas exploration activity in North   Dakota increased since the last report, but was flat in Montana. A Federal   Circuit Court judge upheld a permit for construction of a $10 billion oil   refinery in southeastern South Dakota, which would be the first new refinery in   the United States since 1976. A separate $500 million diesel refinery was in   early planning stages in western North Dakota. Two District ethanol plants are   planning conversions to produce a different biofuel. Ninth District iron ore   mines continued to operate at near capacity. A mining firm is developing plans   in northern Minnesota for a large underground mine to tap a recently discovered   copper deposit. Meanwhile, a tribe in western Montana moved to block a copper   and silver mine on a wilderness site.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions remained strong.   Cattle ranchers benefited from both high beef prices and strong export demand as   well as ideal weather for the calving season. Drought conditions remained in   Minnesota, the Dakotas and western Wisconsin, but were abated somewhat by recent   rain and snowfall. Drier conditions may actually lead to increased corn   plantings in the eastern Dakotas by making long-flooded fields available.   Unseasonably warm weather has led to reports of early spring wheat plantings in   some areas. Prices received by farmers for wheat, corn, dry beans, cattle, hogs,   eggs and poultry increased in March from the previous month, while dairy prices   fell for the month and the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hiring activity outpaced   layoffs since the last report. The new production plant in northwestern   Wisconsin is expected to hire 300 workers. In Montana, a company that services   student loans could hire about 100 more people this summer. A new wheat straw   pulping and molding factory in North Dakota will create 100 jobs. A major   Minnesota-based employer noted that fewer employees accepted a recent early   retirement offer than expected. In contrast, a telecommunications firm in   Minnesota will eliminate 85 positions as part of a restructuring plan, and a   printer laid-off almost 50 workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases were moderate. In a first quarter business survey by St. Cloud   State University (Minnesota), 65 percent of respondents left wages unchanged in   the past three months. However, in western North Dakota and eastern Montana,   strong oil-drilling and production activity continued to bid up pay. In   contrast, a Minnesota business that makes in-store advertising for retailers was   cutting compensation for salespeople and some managers while laying off some   staff.
     </p>
     <p>
      Price increases were generally subdued; however, some exceptions were noted.   More than two-thirds of respondents to the St. Cloud survey reported that prices   at their companies did not change over the past three months. Late March   Minnesota gasoline prices were up about 25 cents per gallon from mid-February   and 20 cents per gallon from a year ago. Airlines raised airfares during the   past couple of months in response to higher fuel costs. A Minnesota-based food   company noted that input cost increases were above 10 percent. Amid higher oil   prices, low natural gas prices have spurred energy and transportation companies   to pursue conversion projects.
