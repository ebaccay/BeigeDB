      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District    continued to grow at a modest pace during the past six weeks. In general, manufacturing output was stable    to increasing. Activity in commercial    construction was steady, with backlogs at acceptable levels. Home builders remain uncertain as to when    the housing market will turn around. Some do not expect an upturn until    turbulence in the housing finance markets subsides. Retail sales in the    District were mixed. Reports on    commercial and consumer lending show demand was steady or decreased    slightly. The mortgage market remains    sluggish, while auto lending increased. Oil and natural gas production showed    little change. And price competition    in the trucking industry intensified.
     </p>
     <p>
      On net, reports point to a slight    increase in employment levels across the District. Staffing firms reported an increase in the    number of permanent openings, while the number of temporary job openings    decreased slightly. The greatest    demand for workers was in the health care industry. Overall, the number of    job seekers has declined since mid-July and on a year-over-year basis. Wage pressures were limited to the energy    sector and some highly technical and professional occupations. Manufacturers and builders told us that    input prices are stable, though some are stable at an elevated level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most District manufacturers reported that production has been stable    to increasing since mid-July. Further,    a majority said they had increased their output on a year-over-year basis.    Looking forward, almost all of our contacts anticipate production remaining    at current levels or increasing slightly.    However, several respondents told us that they are expecting some    softening in their respective markets due to the housing slump, tightening    credit, and higher commodity prices.    Auto assembly plants reported a significant production decline on a    month-over-month basis, most of which is attributable to retooling for model    changeovers. Although both domestic    and foreign nameplates saw declines due to model changeovers, the rate of    decline by domestic producers was almost double that of their    foreign-nameplate counterparts.    Shipments by steel producers and service centers were relatively    stable, even though July is traditionally a slow month. Strong end markets for steel include non    residential construction, energy, and defense.
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, plant utilization rates were at normal    levels to 100 percent capacity.    Manufacturers reporting idle capacity were primarily in the chemical    and auto industries. Almost all    manufacturers told us that capital expenditures were on plan since    mid-July. However, since the last reporting    period, the number of respondents who had expected to increase their capital    investments in the next 12 months has declined. The decline was ascribed    primarily to a softening economy. When    asked about input prices, the majority    of producers we contacted said they were stable, or stable at an elevated    level. Global demand for metals and energy was the most often cited reason    for elevated prices. Only a few of the    manufacturers surveyed had attempted to increase their own prices during the    past six weeks. Looking forward, over    half said they either have plans to increase prices during the fourth quarter    or they will try to raise prices if raw material costs remain high. With respect to their workforce, about 20    percent of our contacts reported adding employees during the past six    weeks. Hiring in the near future is    expected to be slow, with little wage pressure anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      New home sales continue to be slow and are down on a    year-over-year basis. The conversion    rate of traffic to sales remains low; however, cancellations are no longer a    concern for most builders. Looking forward, contractors remain uncertain    about when the housing market will turn around. A few said they do not expect an upturn    until turbulence in the housing finance markets subsides. Most of our contacts reiterated that    inventories are approaching acceptable levels and that they are using    discounting as a means of managing inventory.    In general, new home prices have been stable since mid-July. Several    builders told us that they have reinstituted workforce reductions or have not    replaced personnel who have left voluntarily.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most commercial contractors told us that    business has been steady since mid-July as well as on a year-over-year    basis. Segments showing strong    activity include healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing. The majority    of our respondents is satisfied with their current backlogs and is optimistic    about business opportunities in 2008.    For the most part, material costs were stable during the past six    weeks--metals being the exception. In    turn, almost all builders held their own prices steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District retailers reported mixed    results since mid-July. In general,    apparel retailers experienced declining sales, whereas general merchandise    sales held steady or increased slightly.    Looking forward, merchants anticipate little change in sales trends.    On balance, supplier prices were stable during the past six weeks. Hiring has been limited to new store    openings. Any wage pressures are reported    to be the result of the recently enacted minimum wage law. On net, automobile sales have been slow,    with used vehicles showing increased sales figures and new vehicles posting    declines. Sluggish showroom traffic    was attributed to very hot weather.    Dealer expectations for the next few months are mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Demand for commercial and consumer loans    has held steady or decreased slightly since mid-July. Industries seeking loans were broad    based. The majority of our banking    contacts reported an increase in auto loans, while demand for home equity    loans was mixed. The mortgage market    continues to be sluggish, with no improvement expected in the near future.    Core deposits were stable to increasing    slightly. In general, credit quality    for consumer and business applicants remains stable, while almost half of our    respondents stated that delinquencies have increased slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Oil and gas producers reported    production levels were flat to increasing slightly since mid-July. Plans for drilling additional wells are on    target. Since our last report, prices    received for natural gas have declined while crude prices increased. Producers noted a moderating trend in rising    material and equipment costs. Hiring    was widespread, with a few contacts saying that it is difficult to find    qualified employees. Almost all    respondents told us that wage pressures are continuing, especially for    skilled field personnel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Demand for trucking and shipping    services was characterized as flat during the past six weeks by most    carriers. Representatives told us that    there is intensifying price competition within the industry. As a result, it    is very difficult to pass on increased costs to customers. Further, the ability to recover 100 percent    of fuel costs through surcharges is beginning to erode. Capital expenditures, primarily for truck    engines, have been flat to declining.    Wage increases were limited to annual cost-of-living adjustments. And    a few carriers reported hiring drivers in order to increase capacity.
