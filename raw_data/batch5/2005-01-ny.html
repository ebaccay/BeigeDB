      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has clearly gained further momentum since 

  the last report, and the labor market has taken on a firmer tone. While cost 

  pressures persist, prices of final goods and services generally remain stable. 

  Manufacturers continue to report fairly widespread improvement in business conditions, 

  as well as a pickup in hours worked. Reports from the retail sector, though 

  mixed, are generally more favorable than in the last report, with holiday-season 

  sales roughly in line with expectations.
      <p>
       Residential real-estate markets showed continued strength in the fourth quarter, 

  while office markets were steady to stronger. Tourism is characterized as increasingly 

  robust in both New York City and upstate New York. The securities industry reports 

  an upsurge in business activity, as well as a pickup in hiring, in the fourth 

  quarter. Finally, bankers report a normal seasonal pullback in household loan 

  demand, unchanged credit standards, and lower delinquency rates on commercial 

  loans.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Holiday-season sales were mixed but, on balance, close to plan. Chain stores 

  showed mixed results for the region in December: some indicate that sales were 

  up 3 percent to 4 percent, which was moderately ahead of plan, but a number 

  report that sales fell short of plan, declining by 1 percent to 3 percent. Similarly, 

  a survey of smaller retailers across New York State indicates wide variation 

  in sales results but decent sales overall. Both groups of retailers report that 

  sales were weaker in the first half of the month but strengthened in the week 

  before Christmas and continued strong through early January. Retailers generally 

  attribute the late surge to discounting, as well as increased popularity of 

  gift cards. Inventories were generally said to be at satisfactory levels. Virtually 

  all retail chains indicate that prices were little changed from a year earlier, 

  though a few contacts anticipate some declines in both costs and selling prices 

  for apparel products in 2005 due to the recent expiration of import quotas.
        <p>
         Consumer confidence improved sharply in December, based on two separate surveys. 

  Siena College's survey of New York State residents shows confidence jumping 

  to a five-month high, led by a sharp gain in the New York City area. Similarly, 

  The Conference Board's survey of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, PA) residents 

  shows confidence rebounding to a three-month high in December, led by a 

  surge in the public's assessment of current conditions, which reached 

  its highest level since September 2001.
         <p>
          <strong>
           Construction and Real Estate
          </strong>
          <br/>
          Housing markets continued to show strength in the fourth quarter. New Jersey 

  homebuilders report that the housing market remains steady and strong, though 

  there are scattered reports that prices at the high end of the market leveled 

  off or pulled back in late 2004. Prices of construction materials were generally 

  steady in recent months, after significant escalation in 2003 and the first 

  half of 2004. Similarly, New York State Realtors report persistent strength 

  in the market for existing homes in late 2004, with transactions volume up about 

  5 percent from a year earlier and average prices up 15-20 percent. In Manhattan, 

  a major residential broker indicates that selling prices for co-ops and condos, 

  on average, were up 5-10 percent from a year ago, while a leading appraisal 

  firm reports gains of more than 10 percent; both contacts note a dwindling supply 

  of apartments on the market in recent months.
          <p>
           Commercial real estate markets were steady to stronger at year-end. Manhattan's 

  Class A office vacancy rate fell to a 2Â½-year low of 9.8 percent, down 

  from 10.3 percent in November. Midtown's market showed particular strength, 

  with available space (both direct and sublease) continuing to shrink, and asking 

  rents 10 percent higher than a year earlier. Downtown's vacancy rate fell 

  by more than a point in December, but asking rents have been little changed 

  over the last year. An industry contact notes that the recent pickup in both 

  the Midtown and Downtown markets mainly reflects brisk leasing activity from 

  the financial sector and may signal a pickup in hiring in the securities industry. 

  Suburban markets around New York City showed little change: vacancy rates edged 

  down in northern and central New Jersey and Fairfield County but edged up in 

  Westchester County.
           <p>
            <strong>
             Other Business Activity
            </strong>
            <br/>
            Manufacturers continue to report improving business conditions and ongoing price 

  pressures. Preliminary results from our January survey of New York State manufacturers 

  indicate continued widespread improvement in business conditions, along with 

  a pickup in hiring and hours worked, and some acceleration in selling prices. 

  Similarly, Buffalo-area purchasing managers indicate improved business conditions 

  in December; however, purchasing managers in the New York City area indicate 

  some moderation in manufacturing-sector activity in December, but continued 

  strength in non-manufacturing sectors.
            <p>
             The securities industry ended 2004 on a strong note, according to an industry 

  contact. Investor sentiment improved and activity picked up in virtually all 

  business segments starting in late-October and this trend gained momentum through 

  December. The industry anticipates increased hiring in 2005 and stronger compensation 

  growth than previously projected. More broadly, a major New York City employment 

  agency, specializing in mid-level office jobs, reports that business was unusually 

  brisk in both December and the first week of January, and that financial firms, 

  in particular, have picked up their pace of hiring. Moreover, on the supply 

  side, a growing share of job-seekers is reported to be looking to change jobs.
             <p>
              Tourism also ended 2004 on a strong note. Broadway theaters report a pickup 

  in activity in December; though attendance and revenues for the month were slightly 

  below the lofty levels of a year earlier, the last week of the year set a box-office 

  record. Manhattan hotels report strong business in December: occupancy rates 

  were up 2 percentage points from a year earlier, while room rates were up roughly 

  15 percent; also, bookings for January are said to be relatively strong. Hotel 

  occupancy rates in the Buffalo and Rochester areas were also up noticeably from 

  comparable 2003 levels, and Buffalo's airport notes robust growth in passenger 

  traffic in November and December.
              <p>
               <strong>
                Financial Developments
               </strong>
               <br/>
               Small to medium-sized banks in the Second District report a typical seasonal 

  pullback in demand for consumer and home mortgage loans, while demand for commercial 

  credit held steady. Demand for residential mortgages continued to slip, though 

  declines were less widespread than they have been in six months. Bankers again 

  report little or no change in their credit standards. Interest rates rose across 

  all loan categories, particularly in commercial and industrial loans and commercial 

  real estate. Deposit rates increased according to a majority of respondents, 

  with only 6 percent of bankers reporting lower rates. Bankers report lower delinquency 

  rates for both commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans, 

  while delinquency rates on both consumer and home mortgage loans were little 

  changed.
