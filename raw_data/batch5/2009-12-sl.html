      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 2, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eighth District remained weak but showed signs of   improvement in some areas. Manufacturing activity continued to decline while   services activity began to expand in many areas of the District. Compared with a   year ago, retail sales declined in October and early November, while auto sales   increased over the same period. Residential and commercial real estate market   conditions continued to be weak. Overall lending at a sample of large District   banks declined in the three-month period ending in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in   October and early November were down, on average, over year-earlier levels.   About 52 percent of the retailers saw decreases in sales, while 35 percent saw   increases and 13 percent saw no changes. About 40 percent of the respondents   noted that sales levels met their expectations, 45 percent reported that sales   were below expectations, and 15 percent reported sales above expectations.   Lower-priced items were strong sellers, while higher-priced items moved more   slowly. About 58 percent of the contacts noted that inventories were at desired   levels, while 29 percent reported too-high inventories and 13 percent reported   too-low inventories. The sales outlook among the retailers for the rest of the   year was mixed. About 46 percent of the retailers expect sales for the rest of   the year to increase over 2008 levels, while 42 percent expect sales to decrease   and 12 percent expect sales to remain unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in   October and early November were up, on average. About 39 percent of the car   dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 39 percent saw decreases and 22   percent saw no changes. About 26 percent of the car dealers noted that used car   sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 22 percent reported the   opposite. Also, 26 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales   relative to high-end vehicle sales, while 13 percent reported the opposite.   About 27 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported that their inventories   were too low, while 9 percent reported that their inventories were too high. The   sales outlook among car dealers for the rest of the year was also mixed. About   48 percent of the car dealers expect sales for the rest of the year to increase   over 2008 levels, but 39 percent expect sales to decrease. The remaining 13   percent expect sales to be similar to last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity has continued to decline since our previous report but at a slower   pace. Some contacts expressed optimism that activity would begin to increase in   the months ahead. Firms in the rubber tire, packaging product, food and   beverage, auto manufacturing, furniture, and plastic product manufacturing   industries increased production. Firms in the electrical equipment and component   manufacturing and glass/aluminum product manufacturing industries announced   plans to open new facilities in the District and hire new workers. In contrast,   several firms announced job losses. Contacts in the copper tube, appliance,   lumber, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning manufacturing industries   all cited weak demand as a driver of layoffs. Firms in the auto parts and   transportation industries closed facilities in the District and announced job   losses. A major firm in pharmaceutical products manufacturing announced job   layoffs because of a recent merger.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's service sector has begun to expand in many areas since our   previous report. Contacts in business support services announced plans for   several new facilities and new hires in the District. In contrast, some workers   in education services experienced pay cuts because of budget deficits.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales continued to   decline throughout the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2008,   September 2009 year-to-date home sales were down 6 percent in St. Louis, 7   percent in Louisville, 10 percent in Little Rock, and 14 percent in Memphis.   Residential construction also continued to decline throughout most of the   District. September 2009 year-to-date single-family housing permits fell in most   District metro areas compared with the same period in 2008. Permits declined 14   percent in Little Rock, 20 percent in St. Louis, 23 percent in Louisville, and   44 percent in Memphis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate markets continued to struggle   throughout most of the District. Compared with the second quarter of 2009,   third-quarter 2009 industrial vacancy rates increased in Little Rock, Memphis,   and St. Louis and remained the same in Louisville. During the same period,   suburban and downtown office vacancy rates decreased in Little Rock, increased   in Louisville and St. Louis, and remained the same in Memphis. Contacts   throughout the District noted, however, that total available commercial and   industrial space is considerably higher than vacancy rates suggest when   factoring in sub-leases offered by companies that have reduced staff. Commercial   and industrial construction markets continued their decline. A contact in   northeast Arkansas reported that commercial construction was very slow, with few   projects even in the planning stage. A contact in south central Kentucky noted   that overall commercial construction continues to lag behind the number of   projects in recent years. A contact in St. Louis reported that industrial   construction had fallen sharply compared with the same time last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks showed a decline in overall lending activity in   the three months ending in October. Credit standards for commercial and   industrial loans ranged from basically unchanged to tightened somewhat, while   demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker. Credit   standards for commercial real estate loans tightened, while demand for these   loans was moderately weaker. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans   remained basically unchanged, while demand for these loans weakened. Demand for   residential mortgage loans ranged from moderately stronger to moderately weaker,   while credit standards for these loans remained basically unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wet weather throughout   the District has caused significant delays in harvesting. The rice harvest was   nearly finished in mid-November, but most states were behind normal pace with   other crops. In mid-November, each District state was behind normal pace with   winter wheat planting and crop growth was even farther behind normal. At least   88 percent of the winter wheat in each state with available data was rated fair   or better except in Arkansas, where only three-quarters of the crop achieved   that rating.
