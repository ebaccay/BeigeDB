       <strong>
        Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and   based on information collected before November 18, 2011. This document   summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <hr width="600"/>
      <p>
       Overall economic activity increased at a slow to moderate pace since the   previous report across all Federal Reserve Districts except St. Louis, which   reported a decline in economic activity. District reports indicated that   consumer spending rose modestly during the reporting period. Motor vehicle sales   increased in a number of Districts, and tourism showed signs of strength.   Business service activity was flat to higher since the previous report.   Manufacturing activity expanded at a steady pace across most of the country.   Overall bank lending increased slightly since the previous report, and home   refinancing grew at a more rapid pace. Changes in credit standards and credit   quality varied across Districts. Residential real estate activity generally   remained sluggish, and commercial real estate activity remained lackluster   across most of the nation. Single family home construction was weak and   commercial construction was slow. Districts mostly reported favorable   agricultural conditions. Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased   since the previous report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hiring was generally subdued, although some firms with open positions   reported difficulty finding qualified applicants. Wages and salaries remained   stable across Districts. Overall price increases remained subdued, and some cost   pressures were reported to have eased.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District reports indicated   that consumer spending increased modestly, on balance, during the reporting   period. Kansas City reported that consumer spending strengthened, while retail   sales rebounded in Richmond. Gains in retail sales were noted in Philadelphia,   Cleveland, Minneapolis, and San Francisco. Boston reported that retailers'   estimates of 2011 sales were generally more positive than they were at the   beginning of October, while same-store sales in New York were mostly on or ahead   of plan. Meanwhile, in Dallas, retail sales growth moderated, and Atlanta and   St. Louis reported weaker activity. A few Districts noted that recent colder   weather had spurred apparel sales. Inventory levels were generally at desired or   comfortable levels in New York and Dallas. Retailers in Atlanta continued with   tight inventory management practices, and retailers in Richmond were cautious   regarding inventory and expansion. In Kansas City, inventories were above   year-earlier levels. Holiday sales were generally expected to be flat or to   increase modestly over a year ago in Cleveland, Atlanta, St. Louis, Minneapolis,   Dallas, and San Francisco. In Philadelphia, high-end, online, and outlet   retailers were the most optimistic for holiday sales, while retailers in Chicago   expected to use extended promotional periods and heavy discounting to keep   traffic volumes steady.
      </p>
      <p>
       Motor vehicle sales increased in a number of Districts. Gains in auto sales   were noted in Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, St. Louis, and   Minneapolis. Chicago also reported gains in sales during October, but noted the   pace of sales slowed in November and that dealers suspected consumers may be   waiting for potential end-of-year deals. Upstate New York dealers reported that   sales were steady to stronger and that dealers' service and parts departments   continued to perform well. Auto sales were solid in Kansas City, while demand   held steady in Dallas. Inventory levels were generally lean or lower than   dealers would like in Philadelphia, Cleveland, and St. Louis. In Dallas, vehicle   inventories had mostly normalized, while inventory levels increased in Kansas   City. Both Philadelphia and Dallas noted supply disruptions for some foreign   nameplates due to the flooding in Thailand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism showed signs of strength. New York and Atlanta described tourism as   robust and strong, while activity increased in Minneapolis and posted moderate   improvement in Richmond. Boston noted that the travel and tourism sector   continued to see strength in overseas and business travel, while discretionary   domestic leisure spending was fueled by the affluent customer. In Richmond,   tourism was largely flat, but some contacts were cautiously optimistic about the   winter season. Airline contacts in Dallas expected to see stable demand through   year-end. Strength in hotel bookings and occupancy were noted in Boston, New   York, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, and San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Nonfinancial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business service activity was flat   to higher since the previous report. Boston, New York, Philadelphia,   Minneapolis, and Kansas City reported increased activity. St. Louis was mixed,   while Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco indicated overall flat activity.   Dallas reported that demand for staffing services held steady at high levels.   St. Louis reported that firms in business support services, medical research   services, and transportation services announced plans to expand operations and   hire new workers, while contacts in temporary help services, government   services, and education services announced plans to decrease operations. San   Francisco noted that sales continued to grow for providers of technology   services, in particular for software applications used for mobile computing and   communication devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity grew at a steady   pace across most of the country, with all Districts other than St. Louis   reporting increases in orders, shipments, or production. Chicago, St. Louis, and   San Francisco reported positive results in metals and fabrication, while   Cleveland saw flat steel production and Philadelphia noted decreased demand for   primary metals. Cleveland and Chicago reported increased auto production year   over year, but Boston noted signs of slower auto component production. Dallas   saw steady demand for electronics, computers, and high-technology goods, but San   Francisco reported that demand for consumer electronics continued to decrease.   Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago saw increased production of energy-related   products. For construction-related goods, Chicago and Minneapolis reported   declining demand, while Dallas said demand was stable. Overall, St. Louis saw   more plant closures than plant openings or expansions. Freight transportation   volumes increased in Cleveland, held steady in Atlanta and Kansas City, and were   mixed in Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall bank lending activity   increased slightly since the previous report. New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland,   and Kansas City reported increased loan demand. Several Districts reported an   increase in home refinancing activity. Richmond reported mixed loan activity.   Boston noted plentiful financing and favorable terms for premier properties,   while financing remains harder to obtain for riskier properties and for those in   secondary and tertiary markets. Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, and San Francisco   noted relatively unchanged loans. Atlanta saw soft loan demand as companies   continued to reduce their debt loads and limit expansion and capital improvement   plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Changes in credit standards and credit quality varied across Districts.   Philadelphia noted that credit quality continued to improve but at a slower   rate. Kansas City saw stable or improving loan quality. Dallas noted that the   quality of loans outstanding continued to improve, with contacts reporting a   decline in problem loans. San Francisco saw a slight improvement in overall   credit quality. Cleveland, Chicago, and St. Louis noted relatively unchanged   credit quality. Boston, Richmond, and Atlanta saw some tightening of standards.   In New York, bankers reported declining delinquency rates for commercial and   industrial loans, but no change in delinquencies for other loan categories.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall residential real   estate activity increased, but conditions were varied across Districts.   Philadelphia, Richmond, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and Dallas noted increased   activity. New York, Boston, Cleveland, and San Francisco reported flat activity   at relatively low levels. Atlanta and St. Louis indicated decreased sales.   Residential construction remained sluggish. Single-family home construction   remained weak, while multifamily construction picked up in New York,   Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and Minneapolis. San Francisco remained   "anemic," while St. Louis and Kansas City reported decreased activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets remained sluggish across most of the nation.   Boston, New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated roughly   unchanged activity. Atlanta and Kansas City noted slight improvement.   Philadelphia and Dallas indicated mixed activity. However, Richmond and St.   Louis noted that vacancy rates increased. Commercial construction was somewhat   mixed. Cleveland saw steady to slowly improving commercial construction; Chicago   and Minneapolis experienced modest to moderate increases. New York and   Philadelphia noted generally weak conditions; Richmond and St. Louis reported   slow activity, although industrial construction picked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Districts mostly   reported favorable agricultural conditions. Harvests were ahead of pace or   completed in Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. The corn   harvest was even with last year in Chicago and Minneapolis, while soybean   production decreased. Wheat production was down dramatically in parts of the   Minneapolis District. Corn and soybean yields were above average in the northern   portions of the Kansas City District, but drought conditions severely cut crop   production in the District's southern regions, and the winter wheat crops were   in poor to fair condition. The severe drought in the Dallas District continued   but eased slightly. Prices for most agricultural commodities except soybeans   remained above year-earlier levels, and farm income increases were reported by   Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Export demand remains strong for   agricultural products, particularly meat, but Dallas reported a recent decrease   in demand for grain exports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Activity in the energy and mining sectors increased since the previous   report. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco saw   increases in oil exploration. Cleveland and Dallas also reported growth in shale   gas extraction. Coal production was flat in Cleveland and decreased slightly in   St. Louis, though it is still up for the year. Minneapolis reported that more   wind energy projects were planned. Mining activity increased in San Francisco   and remained at elevated levels in Minneapolis.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Hiring was generally   subdued, but some firms with open positions reported difficulty finding   qualified applicants. Stable employment levels or subdued hiring were mentioned   by New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas. Assessments   of labor market conditions were mixed in Richmond and St. Louis, while labor   markets showed some signs of reduced availability of labor in Minneapolis. In   Boston, demand for workers at services firms grew, but hiring among   manufacturers was limited. In Kansas City, hiring plans among manufacturers   remained solid, while expectations of future hiring among manufacturers in   Philadelphia nearly doubled. Meanwhile, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland,   Richmond, Atlanta, and Minneapolis noted that some firms looking to fill open   positions were having difficulty finding qualified workers, particularly for   high-skilled manufacturing and technical positions. Atlanta noted there was   growing concern that the skills of the unemployed were deteriorating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wages and salaries remained stable across Districts, although some exceptions   were noted. In Cleveland, wage pressures emerged for truck drivers as the pool   of available drivers shrank relative to job openings. Manufacturing wage growth   strengthened in Richmond, while hiring stabilized and the average workweek was   unchanged. Some wage growth was noted among the highly skilled trades in   Atlanta. In Minneapolis, wages increased sharply at some fast food restaurants   in western North Dakota. Kansas City reported that some energy and information   technology firms raised wages for skilled workers; Dallas reported the same for   airlines and a few construction-related manufacturers. San Francisco noted   persistent upward pressure on benefit costs, especially for employee health   care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall price increases remained subdued, and some cost pressures were   reported to have eased. Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas City noted a   moderation in input cost pressures. In Cleveland, manufacturers' reports on   changes in raw materials prices were mixed; the transportation sector noted   higher prices for tires, parts, and equipment; and fuel prices exhibited some   volatility. Richmond reported that raw materials, retail, and services prices   grew at a somewhat faster pace. Restaurants in Kansas City expected higher menu   prices due to rising food costs. In Dallas, prices for new cars rose slightly,   and staffing and legal services firms noted modest increases in billing rates,   but natural gas prices remained low. San Francisco reported a recent uptick in   the prices for energy inputs, particularly oil, and for assorted food items at   the retail level. Atlanta noted that most businesses had limited ability to pass   on increases in input prices from earlier in the year.
