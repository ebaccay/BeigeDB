      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity improved across the Fifth District since our last   assessment. Retail sales improved, despite weak sales of big-ticket items.   Manufacturing activity continued to advance, as evidenced by further increases   in shipments and orders. House sales showed some improvement, although prices   continued to edge downward, and commercial leasing also experienced a slight   uptick over the last six weeks. Tourist activity improved, with bookings showing   moderate strength at both mountain and coastal resorts. While activity in both   the service and banking sectors remained mixed, positive reports were more   prevalent than in our last assessment. Labor markets were weak throughout the   District, with steady employment in manufacturing and falling employment on the   retail side of the service sector. Moderate price increases were reported in   both manufacturing and service sectors. Finally, excessive dampness delayed the   planting of crops in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rebounded since our last report,   owing in part to a slower decline in big-ticket sales. The store manager at a   central North Carolina chain department store said sales were "coming out of the   doldrums," and Easter sales were especially strong this year. Weakness in   big-ticket sales was mitigated by early tax refunds, as consumers bought   furniture and flat screen televisions. Also, as the unusually snowy winter   ended, sales of seasonal outdoor items such as lawn mowers, improved. A contact   at a Washington, D.C., beltway department store reported that sales were 6   percent above a year ago and that his counterparts at local mall stores also saw   improved sales growth in recent weeks. The pace of District grocery sales rose   in recent weeks, although a Virginia food distributor noted rapid increases in   input prices for many product categories. Sales of automobiles and light trucks   were mixed; in the Carolinas and West Virginia, dealers reported stronger   business, while sales remained tepid elsewhere in the District. In contrast, a   few contacts were less confident â€“ a retailer in West Virginia told us that   customers remained cautious about spending. Retail prices edged up slightly   since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from non-retail services firms were   mixed. A contact at an advertising business reported, "We expect to bounce along   the bottom for some time," and an executive at a North Carolina property   management business said, "The repo man is busy." While a hospital in the   Piedmont area cut employees, blaming the weak economy, another North Carolina   hospital executive said previously planned capital projects were going forward.   In addition, professional, scientific, and technical firms across the District   indicated that business had picked up in recent weeks. Price change at   services-providing firms was virtually flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing advanced somewhat   faster since our last report. A majority of the contacts reported that shipments   posted gains and new orders continued to increase, while employment stabilized.   A producer of electronic components reported that his company had seen a nice   order "bump" in March, providing a strong order backlog going into April.   Moreover, a manufacturer of door components noted an unusual confluence of   events currently driving his business. "The earthquake in Chile and subsequent   halt on shipment of products from that country has resulted in a sharp run-up of   demand for domestically produced wood products, with pricing escalating   dramatically as well." Similarly, a ball bearings manufacturer indicated that   demand from the automotive industry continued to be very strong, but noted that   steel pricing was growing at an alarming rate and freight costs, particularly on   ocean freight, were up dramatically. Accordingly, most contacts reported that   both raw materials and finished goods prices increased at a quicker pace since   our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Port activity over the last few months was up slightly. Both imports and   exports posted moderate gains, although exports tended to outperform import   gains. While the dollar was seen as a contributing factor, most contacts   attributed gains in exports primarily to improvements in overseas markets. One   contact stated that exports would have been even stronger if the right mix of   containers had been available. However, shipping costs increased in recent   months, which discouraged some companies from exporting. One contact also   reported that total tonnage so far this year was down from the fourth quarter of   last year, partly due to adverse weather that prevented producers from getting   their goods to the docks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking activity was generally mixed, but with   more signs of improvements than in our last assessment. On the commercial and   industrial side, weak loan demand prevailed in most local markets, although   several bankers reported modest improvements. Upticks in loans for new   equipment, especially upgrades by professional services, were also noted, and   one banker cited an increase in SBA loans. Auto dealers, however, continued to   struggle to get floor-plan financing, and construction loans were down. On the   mortgage side, reports of loan demand varied between no change and modest   increases. Refinancing activity was important in some markets, but rising   mortgage rates were curtailing refinancing in others. First-time buyers   continued to dominate loan applications. One banker reported an increase in   lending on foreclosed homes, and added that very few home loan applications were   for upgrades. Credit quality was little changed in recent months, and banks were   about evenly split between reporting increases and decreases in delinquent   payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential Realtors in the District gave   generally upbeat reports on house sales. While the tax credit program remained   the single most important motivating factor, one Realtor told us that sales over   the past three months had outweighed all of his 2009 sales and that only 18-20   percent of the buyers had taken advantage of the tax credit. House prices were   mixed across the District. For example, prices rose in Fairfax and Greensboro,   held steady in Greenville, and were relatively flat in Richmond. Notable   decreases in prices were reported in Washington, D.C., where a significant   increase in sales of lower-priced properties were reported, and in   Fredericksburg, where a Realtor stated that, "banks seem to be willing to take   anything within reason to reduce their holdings of foreclosed properties."
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity picked up slightly since our last report.   Most contacts generally reported an uptick in leasing activity, particularly in   the office and industrial sectors, while activity in the retail sector remained   sluggish. Effective rental rates decreased somewhat as landlords became more   aggressive in offering concessions. Vacancy rates were generally high, although   vacancy rates in some local markets did improve. Sales activity continued to be   hampered by stringent bank requirements and a scarcity of creditworthy buyers.   However, one contact reported that property sales increased somewhat due to   foreclosed properties being purchased at very low prices. While contacts   reported very little new construction over the past few weeks, some activity was   reported on the industrial side for some build-to-suit projects and some bidders   continued to submit proposals at low or no profit just to keep their doors open.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Assessments of tourist activity improved somewhat   since our last report. Along the coast, contacts noted somewhat stronger   bookings, compared to our last survey. An analyst on the Outer Banks of North   Carolina said that bookings for the Easter weekend were looking good with   advanced rentals up 10 percent over last year. A manager from Myrtle Beach   indicated that last-minute bookings had picked up, which he attributed to the   recent warm weather and steep discounts on special packages at most hotels.   Managers at mountain resorts throughout the District reported one of their best   ski seasons ever--both in terms of business activity and revenues--and mentioned   that vacationers were booking early and staying close to home. Finally, the 98th   annual National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C., is off to a good   start and is expected to attract record crowds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District labor markets remained soft   over the past several weeks, but declines in some sectors eased. Job cuts   subsided at retail businesses, and employment was unchanged at most other   services firms as well as in manufacturing. A West Virginia automobile dealer   increased hiring, and a retailer reported that he was only replacing workers,   but continued to give raises. Average wages edged higher in March in the service   sector, but declined slightly in manufacturing. Contacts at temporary employment   agencies reported generally stronger demand for temporary help since our last   report. Reports from some agency clients indicated that, while they saw an   increase in business, they remained unsure how long it would last and opted to   continue using contingent labor. However, one temporary agency reported that   clients were now filling positions that had been eliminated at the depth of the   economic downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although drier weather prevailed in recent   weeks, wet fields continued to hinder plantings and field preparation in many   areas of the District. Indications of delayed fertilization of winter grains and   forage seeding were evident in some areas. In Virginia, grain farmers attempted   to fertilize their wheat and barley fields, but were forced to wait for drier   weather. In addition, hay was still being fed to livestock in many areas of the   state. Nevertheless, winter wheat was reported to be in mostly fair-to-good   condition in South Carolina and West Virginia. In addition, drier weather during   the first week of April allowed farmers in South Carolina to plant corn at a   rapid pace. Finally, results of our recent survey of agricultural credit   conditions indicated that farmland values were above the previous quarter and   year-ago levels.
