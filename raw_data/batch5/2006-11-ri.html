      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 29, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District expanded at a somewhat stronger pace 
  from late October through mid November, despite continued sluggishness in housing 
  markets. Revenues at services firms grew slightly faster, aided by firmer demand 
  at health care organizations and government contractors. Retail sales grew briskly, 
  despite sluggishness in most big-ticket categories. Manufacturing reversed its 
  October dip, posting increased shipments and orders in recent weeks. Commercial 
  leasing remained strong, while housing activity continued to weaken somewhat, 
  with softer prices more in evidence. Mortgage lenders, however, noted some firming 
  in loan demand following several months of weakening activity. Tourism was healthy, 
  with most areas reporting gains in recent weeks. Labor markets tightened further, 
  with some reports of higher wages and shortages of skilled workers. Price pressures 
  were mixed, moderating in retail and services, but ramping up in manufacturing. 
  Mild temperatures and ample rainfall helped small grains, but limited fieldwork 
  opportunities for District farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales grew at a substantially faster pace in early 
  November, although weakness remained in most big-ticket categories. Chain department 
  stores and grocery stores noted stronger sales, and big box retailers said electronics 
  sales were especially robust. In addition, a contact at a large hardware store 
  in central Virginia said sales growth had picked up, even with significant price 
  increases on "anything made with steel or petroleum." In contrast, 
  sales slowed at home improvement and building supply stores as housing activity 
  remained sluggish. The pace of automobile and light truck sales was generally 
  unchanged from a month ago, though a few dealers said their sales declined in 
  recent weeks. Retailers were upbeat but somewhat guarded about holiday sales 
  this year; some looked for holiday sales to increase about 4% compared to last 
  year. Although a few District automobile dealers and furniture stores reduced 
  staff, hiring picked up at most retail businesses. Wages grew more quickly at 
  retail establishments, while price growth slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District services firms indicated that their revenues grew slightly faster since 
  our last report. Customer demand strengthened at healthcare organizations and 
  utilities, and federal government contractors said that business had picked 
  up with the new federal fiscal-year budget. Additionally, a financial services 
  consultant in Virginia characterized demand as steady, and he noted improving 
  client attitudes regarding the economy. Contacts at services firms said the 
  pace of hiring moderated this month. Wage and price growth also slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the manufacturing sector picked up during the first half of November 
  following a contraction in October. Contacts told us that factory shipments, 
  new orders and employment expanded at a solid pace in recent weeks. Activity 
  was particularly strong at chemicals, food, industrial machinery and transportation 
  equipment firms; a turbine producer in South Carolina, for example, said that 
  the oil industry was driving his business. He indicated that they had received 
  three large turbine contracts for Saudi Arabia. A plastics producer was also 
  upbeat, noting, "November was a good month; we've had a flurry of new orders 
  and our backlogs are strong." In contrast, a furniture manufacturer in North 
  Carolina reported that sales had reached their lowest level since the post September 
  11, 2001 period. Prices for both raw materials and finished goods picked up 
  considerably in November after rising moderately in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers reported that loan demand steadied since our last report. Residential 
  mortgage lending remained weak, but some increased demand in the new homes sector 
  helped to stabilize loan volume. Some contacts said that builders were slashing 
  prices which "caused more people to get in on the action." A number of mortgage 
  lenders reported that loan standards had tightened. A Charleston, S.C., banker 
  noted that his bank was more carefully scrutinizing "the type of properties 
  receiving loans, but not applicants." The demand for commercial loans held firm 
  in October and November. Little change was reported in interest rates or the 
  rates of delinquent loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate agents across the District reported continued weakness 
  in home sales. A Washington, D.C., agent told us that sales were down 17 percent 
  from a year earlier, and he predicted that this trend would persist for another 
  two years. In Richmond, Va., home sales were also reported to have fallen below 
  2005 levels. An agent there told us that buyers were not rushing to make purchasing 
  decisions--they could afford to "pick and choose." Home inventories continued 
  to rise modestly and some sellers were trimming asking prices. In contrast, 
  a contact in Greenville, S.C., reported "positive sales" which he attributed 
  mostly to large companies locating there recently. Several contacts noted modest 
  decreases in home prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate agents across the District reported that leasing activity 
  remained healthy in recent weeks. In the Raleigh market, a contact said industrial 
  activity was "on fire," driven by strong population growth in the area. Contacts 
  generally reported that vacancy rates edged down since our last report and several 
  noted a slight uptick in rental rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity was generally stronger since our last report. A contact on 
  North Carolina's Outer Banks said hotels and resorts were booked solid for the 
  Veteran's Day weekend. She attributed the increase primarily to their first 
  marathon which attracted 4,400 runners. In addition, a manager at a mountain 
  resort in western Virginia noted record-breaking time-share sales--up nearly 
  20 percent over last year. In contrast, a hotelier at Virginia Beach reported 
  that some corporate clients had scaled down their budgets--resulting in less 
  money being spent on food and beverages.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary employment agencies in the District continued to report generally 
  firmer demand for workers since our last report. In some areas, tight labor 
  markets had made it difficult for companies to fill needed positions. Workers 
  with sales, life sciences, engineering and financial skills remained in strong 
  demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mild, rainy weather conditions assisted small grain development in most areas 
  of the District, but rains delayed field work in some regions. Analysts in Virginia 
  and Maryland told us that soggy field conditions hindered soybean harvests. 
  They noted, however, that higher grain prices in recent weeks encouraged farmers 
  to continue small grain plantings when the weather permitted. In South Carolina, 
  harvesting of sweet potatoes and apples was ahead of schedule, while corn and 
  soybean harvests fell behind schedule in West Virginia. Harvests of cotton, 
  peanuts, sweet potatoes, sorghum and soybeans were nearing completion in North 
  Carolina, and Christmas tree producers in that state said they were preparing 
  for the holiday season.
