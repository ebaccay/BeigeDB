      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy expanded at an accelerated pace over the past   six weeks. In particular, energy sector respondents noted increased activity.   Sectors that had previously reported weak demand, including accounting, legal   and financial services--as well as the construction sector--noted improvement   since the last report. Price pressures remain elevated, and more firms expect to   add to payrolls in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures remain elevated, according to most   responding firms in the Eleventh District. Many manufacturers said they had   raised prices since the last report, but not enough to offset raw material cost   increases, leaving margins squeezed. Several responding firms said price   increases were becoming necessary to cover previous upticks in fuel, freight and   or raw materials prices. Most construction-related manufacturing firms either   planned or had implemented selling price increases; and construction firms   expected cost increases to stick, noting producers of construction-related   products could no longer absorb higher energy and freight costs. Several service   sector companies reported increased ability to raise prices during the past six   weeks. Most said the increases were necessary to cover previous increases in   fuel, freight and/or raw materials prices. Higher demand for accounting-advisory   services has resulted in price increases. Agricultural contacts said crop prices   had fallen slightly but remain at relatively high levels. Retailers said prices   increased modestly over the past six weeks, and most expected their selling   prices to remain elevated due to increases in input prices and transportation   costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of crude oil stayed over $105 per barrel for much of April before   falling back under $100 in mid-May. Gasoline prices remained elevated during the   reporting period due to concerns about refinery flooding along the Mississippi,   according to contacts. Natural gas prices remained low, in a range between $4.15   to $4.30 per Mcf. Since the last report, prices increased at a strong pace for   many important petrochemical products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment levels rose or held steady at   most responding firms. There were increased reports of hiring activity compared   with the previous reporting period. Most staffing firms noted strong demand at   stable levels. Contacts in financial services, auto sales, construction and   related materials, and transportation manufacturing reported hiring increases.   Some high-tech manufacturers noted an increase in employment for skilled   workers. Wage pressures were slightly higher, with increases reported by some   accounting and finance firms. Moreover, high-tech respondents noted compensation   was increasing due to the return of bonuses that had been temporarily halted   during the recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most construction-related manufacturers   noted a pick-up in demand since the last report. Some of the uptick was seasonal   and expected, but several contacts said that it was difficult to separate out   seasonal demand from improved business conditions. Public projects still account   for a large share of orders, but contacts said demand had increased because of   an acceleration in private projects such as apartment and commercial buildings.   The one exception was the lumber industry, where responses mostly reflected   weaker conditions over the past six weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in high-tech manufacturing said sales and orders remain strong   overall, but demand was mixed. One source of weakening demand was the ripple   effects of the natural disaster in northern Japan as shortages of parts fed into   slowdowns in demand for complementary parts. Several respondents noted a broad   pickup in consumer demand from India and China and, within the US, an increase   in demand for products such as 3-D televisions, tablets and smart phones.   Contacts also reported an increase in orders for semiconductors due to a pickup   in demand from the industrial, medical and auto sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from most paper manufacturers reflected stable to improved orders   stemming from broad-based economic strengthening. Transportation manufacturing   firms said orders were strong and several said demand had risen slightly since   the last report. Respondents in the food industry said sales continued to   increase at a steady pace over the past six weeks and outlooks remained   positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical firms said supplies were very tight, in part due to restricted   capacity caused by unplanned domestic plant outages, as well as reduced   production in or near the Japanese earthquake zone. Demand remains strong for   most products, and prices are rising. High profits and strong margins for   ethylene producers have led to announcements of several new plants and   expansions in the Gulf Coast and elsewhere. Refiners reported extremely strong   profit margins, and said domestic gasoline inventories were near the bottom of   the normal range.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail activity increased moderately over   the reporting period. Looking at March and April and smoothing out fluctuations   due to the Easter holiday, demand has increased in the low- to mid-single digits   over the prior year. Some contacts mentioned gasoline prices as a concern but   the effects of elevated prices have been limited thus far. Texas continues to   perform above the national average, according to one large retailer, and the   outlook for 2011 remains positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales continue to improve, but inventories will likely be thin in   coming months due to the effects of the tsunami on Japanese manufacturers supply   chains. Contacts expect demand to continue improving at a modest pace throughout   2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Non-financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms reported growth in   orders has leveled off or slowed slightly since the last report, although demand   remains strong, particularly from the energy, healthcare, insurance and banking   sectors. Outlooks are positive, and contacts expect demand to remain stable   through year-end. Demand for accounting services increased since the last   report, as is typical for this time of year. Improved demand has helped firms   raise fees for advisory services. Legal firms noted mostly steady demand, with   some strength in corporate, intellectual property litigation, and real estate   services.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from transportation services contacts were mostly positive.   Intermodal transportation firms noted an increase in cargo volumes during the   reporting period. Railroad shipments rose moderately, with particularly strong   volume growth in grains, metals, petroleum and chemical products. Container   trade volumes declined but were up from year-ago levels. Growth in small parcel   shipments accelerated during the reporting period buoyed by demand from the   wholesale trade and retail sectors. Airline traffic held steady over the past   six weeks. Demand for travel within the US and to Latin America was solid, but   load factors for international flights to and from the Pacific region remained   weak. Contacts expect modest improvement in airline demand and revenue this   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial firms reported steady   overall loan demand. Large banks with a national footprint reported some pickup   in commercial and industrial loan demand with increased corporate activity, and   commercial real estate (CRE) activity has shown recent improvement as well.   Regional banks noted that loan demand remains pretty flat, although optimism   persists for pockets of homebuilding and some CRE lending across the state.   Demand for auto and consumer loans declined. Contacts continue to note that loan   pricing remains aggressive amidst a highly competitive lending landscape.   Outlooks are generally positive in light of better outstanding loan quality and   continued slow improvement in lending conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Eleventh District housing   contacts said sales remain at low levels, but optimism has increased along with   better traffic. Sales are expected to improve in the second half of 2011. As   reported in previous reports, sales in the higher price points continue to   improve. Apartment demand continues to accelerate, and rents have edged up since   the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Private nonresidential demand has improved. Leasing activity is growing and   there are reports that industrial and office construction are increasing from   very low levels. Sales of commercial buildings are also picking up across the   District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drilling activity is very strong and growing,   according to responding firms in the energy industry. A majority of wells being   drilled in the United States are directed to oil for the first time since May   1995. Contacts noted Texas is leading the expansion of domestic activity, with   strong activity in the Permian basin and Eagle Ford Shale. While the majority of   activity is land-based, work is being re-permitted in the Gulf of Mexico, and   service firms noted they are moving workers back into the Gulf area. Respondents   also noted that international work continues to grow.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The entire Eleventh District is experiencing   drought conditions, and the severity has progressed considerably. About half of   the district is now in exceptional drought, the most severe drought   classification, up from zero percent at the last report. The outlook for the   wheat crop is poor and it is likely that the cotton harvest will be down from   last year. Numerous wildfires have led to an estimated $20.4 million in   agricultural losses.
