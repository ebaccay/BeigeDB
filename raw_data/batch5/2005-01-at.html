      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixth District business contacts reported that the pace of economic activity 

  increased during late November and December. Most retailers conveyed that holiday 

  sales were up modestly from year-ago levels, while auto sales rebounded somewhat. 

  Travel and tourism contacts noted healthy seasonal activity, with the strongest 

  results coming from Florida. Reports from manufacturers were mostly positive 

  and capacity utilization continued to increase. According to contacts, housing 

  markets in many parts of the District continued at high levels, while commercial 

  markets noted small improvements. The demand for labor continued to increase, 

  and reports noted a shortage of skilled workers in some industries. Contacts 

  reported that prices were largely in check, although increases for building 

  supplies and health insurance were exceptions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail contacts indicated that holiday sales were up modestly compared with 

  last year. Retailers in several Florida locations reported that they benefited 

  from strong tourism over the holidays. Intense competition among merchants led 

  to widespread discounting, but most contacts noted that fourth-quarter profit 

  margins equaled or exceeded last year's results. Electronics, jewelry and women's 

  apparel sold well across much of the region, while home-related products sales 

  were mixed. Most retail contacts anticipated modest sales growth in the first 

  quarter of 2005.
     </p>
     <p>
      District car dealers were encouraged by improved sales at year-end. This improvement 

  was largely attributed to extensive promotional programs. Sales of District-assembled 

  models were mixed, with transplanted foreign brands outperforming domestic brands.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that District housing markets displayed strong levels of activity 

  during November and December. In many markets, construction and sales of new 

  homes posted gains, bringing them close to year-ago levels. New housing construction 

  continued to pick up in Florida following delays caused by the hurricanes. Both 

  builders and Realtors in Florida noted shortages of homes for sale. Nonresidential 

  construction remained at low levels, but there were scattered reports of increasing 

  industrial development. District office markets continued to recover very slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the factory sector were generally positive and most contacts noted 

  increased utilization of operating capacity in late November and December. Manufacturers 

  of construction materials and steel were operating at especially high levels 

  of capacity because of strong demand. Contacts noted increased output for pulp 

  and paper producers, and reports from carpet producers and the defense sector 

  were positive as well. Less positively, a computer circuit board manufacturer 

  plans to cut 525 jobs in response to strong competition from Asian producers 

  and a machine tool firm reported a decline in new orders. District trucking 

  contacts continued to report increasing demand for freight services at year-end. 

  In addition, the ports of Savannah, Brunswick and Jacksonville posted double-digit 

  gains in both inbound and outbound shipping and Miami and Atlanta airport cargo 

  tonnage was higher than year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Industry reports suggest that the District's tourism industry performed well 

  in late November and December, and the outlook remained positive for the rest 

  of the winter season. Increased attendance at Florida attractions was reportedly 

  boosted by a rise in foreign visits. Central Florida theme parks were filled 

  to capacity and restaurants and hotels have increased hiring. Repairs to tourist 

  facilities in hurricane-damaged areas continued. In Nashville, hotel room tax 

  collections were running more than 8 percent ahead of 2003 and bookings suggested 

  the strongest December in four years. Some District signs have also recently 

  emerged of improvement in the business meeting and convention sector. Bookings 

  of the exhibit space at downtown Atlanta's Georgia World Congress Center are 

  up notably from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial sector reports were mostly positive in late November and December. 

  Consumer loan demand remained steady at strong levels and delinquency rates 

  remained low. Commercial loan demand improved marginally but remained at low 

  levels overall. Asset quality remained strong across most of the District, and 

  insurance proceeds and federal loans boosted deposit levels in parts of Florida. 

  Reports indicated that venture capital spending was increasing in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts, labor markets improved in late November and December. 

  Several manufacturers reported that they were adding workers and some reported 

  difficulty finding qualified staff. Commercial and residential building contractors 

  reported that subcontractors, such as carpenters and roofers, were especially 

  hard to find. Contacts in some parts of the District also reported that demand 

  for workers in technology service industries has improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      Rising building supply and healthcare costs continued to be widely reported. 

  According to most reports, price increases for building materials were being 

  passed along to homebuyers. Several business contacts noted that a larger share 

  of the increase in health insurance costs was being passed along to employees 

  than a year ago. Fuel surcharges continued to be used by transportation firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Weather patterns fluctuated markedly in late November and December, but no major 

  impact on District crops was reported.
