      Beige Book: National Summary

       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve districts indicated that economic activity 
  
  continued to expand from late November through early January. Eleven districts 
  
  characterized activity as expanding with Atlanta, New York, and Richmond noting 
  
  that the pace of activity had quickened since their last reports. The Cleveland 
  
  District was less upbeat, characterizing economic activity in that district 
  
  as mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer spending was generally higher since the last Beige Book and a number 
    
  of districts reported that retail sales during the holidays were above year-ago 
    
  levels. While the pace of spending was sluggish in a number of districts at 
    
  the beginning of the period, it picked up appreciably by late December. Adding 
    
  to the strength in household spending was an increase in tourism in several 
    
  districts. Most districts reported that manufacturing activity firmed and many 
    
  districts said that businesses planned to increase capital spending in 2005. 
    
  Although several reports noted some slowing in residential real estate and construction 
    
  activity, real estate markets remained generally strong. In the financial sector, 
    
  lending activity was mixed, as modestly higher commercial and industrial lending 
    
  was tempered by slower residential mortgage lending. Several districts noted 
    
  that agricultural conditions were favorable and that activity in the energy 
    
  sector remained strong. Labor markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage 
    
  pressures generally remained modest. Several districts reported higher prices 
    
  for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or 
    
  only slightly higher overall price levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending increased in most districts since the last Beige Book report, 

  with only Cleveland, Dallas, and New York reporting that sales were mixed. Boston, 

  Chicago, Dallas, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco said that retail sales 

  were slow in early December but picked up the pace from Christmas through the 

  end of the year. Sales of luxury goods were strong in the Kansas City, Philadelphia, 

  and San Francisco districts, while retailers in the Atlanta, Chicago, and Kansas 

  City districts reported that electronics and jewelry sold well during the holiday 

  season. Boston, Richmond, and San Francisco reported higher sales of building 

  supplies, and Boston, Chicago, and St. Louis noted stronger sales of apparel. 

  Gift cards sold briskly according to the Chicago, Kansas City, Minneapolis, 

  and New York reports. Post-holiday retail inventories were at satisfactory levels 

  in the Kansas City, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco districts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobile sales were mixed. Atlanta, Chicago, Cleveland, and Kansas City 

  noted higher sales, but St. Louis and Dallas said new car sales slowed. Atlanta, 

  Philadelphia, and San Francisco noted that sales of foreign cars outperformed 

  domestic makes. Dealers in the Chicago, Dallas, and Philadelphia districts reported 

  that automobile dealers' inventories remained above desired levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourist activity strengthened in several districts. Boston said that increased 

  business travel, corporate spending, citywide conventions and increased international 

  travel boosted hotel occupancy rates. Occupancy rates were also up in the San 

  Francisco district, and the number of Japanese visitors to Hawaii has returned 

  to pre-September 11 levels. New York noted that tourist activity was higher 

  both upstate and in New York City where Broadway theaters set a box-office record 

  during the last week of the year. In addition, the Atlanta report indicated 

  that tourism was strong and that central Florida theme parks were filled to 

  capacity. Kansas City indicated that some ski resorts in the district reported 

  near-record levels of visitors. Richmond reported that because of unseasonably 

  mild weather, hotels were booked to capacity in coastal areas and that some 

  were turning tourists away during the week after Christmas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The Dallas, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported 

  steady to stronger demand at services firms since the last Beige Book. Atlanta, 

  Dallas, San Francisco, and St. Louis noted stronger demand for transportation 

  services, with some seaports in the Atlanta district posting double-digit gains 

  in both inbound and outbound shipping. Air passenger traffic was higher at airports 

  in the Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City, and New York districts while air freight 

  volume increased in the Atlanta district. New York's report also noted 

  that the securities industry ended 2004 on a strong note.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity strengthened since the last Beige Book report. Nine of 

  the 12 districts indicated that factory output rose, while Chicago, Cleveland, 

  and Richmond noted that production was steady. Boston, Philadelphia, and San 

  Francisco indicated that demand for transportation equipment strengthened measurably. 

  Production of electrical machinery increased in the Philadelphia district, and 

  Chicago reported strong output of heavy equipment. Atlanta, Dallas, and San 

  Francisco reported that production of building materials picked up, while Chicago 

  and San Francisco indicated that orders for machine tools increased in their 

  districts. San Francisco also reported that semiconductor orders and sales were 

  generally solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some manufacturing sectors weakened. Richmond reported that textiles and 

  apparel shipments continued to decline. Atlanta reported layoffs at a computer 

  circuit board plant, and Dallas noted slowing demand in consumer communications 

  equipment. Philadelphia indicated that demand softened for lumber and wood products, 

  paper products, and plastics, and Cleveland reported that sales at automobile 

  industry suppliers slowed at year-end. St. Louis said that firms in the fabricated 

  metal product, wood product, chemical, and apparel industries announced plant 

  closings and layoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking ahead, manufacturers expected conditions to remain positive in coming 

  months. Most districts reported that manufacturers intend to increase their 

  capital spending in 2005. Firms in the Chicago district upped their planned 

  capital expenditures for next year; most have already begun to place orders 

  to accomplish those spending goals. Minneapolis indicated that expectations 

  of higher sales by businesses led to plans to increase capital spending in 2005. 

  Kansas City noted greater capital spending in 2005 to replace outdated equipment. 

  Richmond reported that manufacturers planned to increase capital spending despite 

  their skepticism about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate activity generally remained strong. Atlanta, Boston, 

  New York, Richmond, and San Francisco said that housing markets in their districts 

  continued to show strength in the fourth quarter of 2004, and Dallas and St. 

  Louis reported some improvement since the last Beige Book. Chicago reported 

  mixed housing activity, possibly because of a seasonal slowdown in December, 

  but noted a slight pickup in sales during the first week of January; real estate 

  activity was also mixed in the Minneapolis district. The Kansas City District 

  reported flat to slightly higher home sales compared with a year earlier. New 

  York reported that prices for upper-end New Jersey properties leveled off, or 

  pulled back, but that prices for Manhattan co-ops and condos continued to rise. 

  Richmond said home prices continued to rise in most areas of that district.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate conditions strengthened in most districts in December 

  and early January. Real estate agents in the Dallas, New York, Richmond, San 

  Francisco, and St. Louis districts reported that leasing activity increased--particularly 

  for office space. Office leasing was especially brisk in Washington, D.C., and 

  New York City, two of the nation's strongest commercial markets. Contacts 

  in New York said the recent uptick in activity sent the Class A office vacancy 

  rate to a two-and-a-half-year low and may be a signal of increased hiring in 

  that area. In other districts, vacancies were mixed--rates dipped in San 

  Francisco, St. Louis, and most of the Kansas City District, but were generally 

  unchanged in other areas. Adding to the positive tone, commercial construction 

  activity was higher since the last Beige Book report--contacts in Atlanta, 

  Chicago, Minnesota, Richmond, and St. Louis reported new industrial or office 

  construction activity, while retail construction maintained a generally steady 

  pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Lending activity remained generally mixed as slower residential mortgage lending 

  offset somewhat higher commercial and industrial lending in many districts. 

  Commercial lending was modestly higher in the Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco 

  districts while commercial and industrial lending was stronger in the Kansas 

  City, Philadelphia, and St. Louis districts. Residential mortgage lending, however, 

  declined in the Chicago, Dallas, and New York districts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several districts reported that credit conditions were steady, though Dallas 

  added that competition between banks in that district could threaten credit 

  quality in the months ahead. In addition, Chicago and San Francisco reported 

  that banks' profit margins on loans were thin.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Several districts noted that crop and livestock conditions were generally favorable, 

  despite widely varying weather conditions. Richmond indicated that unseasonably 

  warm weather in early December accelerated the development of winter grains 

  and extended the grazing period for livestock. But very cold temperatures and 

  snowfall in late December led to supplemental feeding of livestock. A major 

  snow storm affected part of the St. Louis District in late December, leaving 

  fields and pastures muddy. Despite the excess soil moisture, St. Louis said 

  the winter wheat crop was in mostly fair to good condition. Minneapolis noted 

  that Montana's 2005 winter wheat crop was good to excellent despite little 

  snow cover to protect against freeze or wind damage. Kansas City added that 

  some producers in the western part of its district remained concerned that dry 

  pastures could deteriorate further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agricultural prices were generally higher. The Chicago district reported that 

  net farm income jumped last year as a result of profitable livestock operations 

  and record corn and soybean harvests, much of which was forward-contracted at 

  unusually high prices. In addition, Minneapolis reported milk prices were higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from 

  the Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco districts. Minneapolis 

  indicated increased mining activity, noting that the delivery of some mining 

  machinery required two-year waits. Kansas City reported that oil and gas drilling 

  rig counts remained well above year-ago levels, and noted constraints on drilling 

  due to labor and equipment shortages. Dallas added that the level of land drilling 

  was mostly unchanged but that offshore activity had picked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Markets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Districts generally reported firmer labor markets in late 2004. Contacts in 

  Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, and Richmond reported improvement 

  on the job front, while respondents in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco saw 

  little change in hiring activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing employment rose in Kansas City, New York, Richmond and St. Louis, 

  while factory owners in Philadelphia anticipated adding workers in coming months. 

  Planned factory hiring in Cleveland was mixed by product type--producers of 

  nondurable goods predicted little change in future hiring, but makers of durable 

  goods anticipated adding to their payrolls in the months ahead. Services sector 

  respondents in Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis reported broad-based strengthening 

  in services sector employment, and contacts in New York and Philadelphia noted 

  a particularly strong pickup in securities industry hiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information on employment staffing services firms was mostly positive, but 

  varied by district. Contacts in Cleveland, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis 

  reported a moderate to brisk rise in demand, but Richmond noted generally flat 

  activity and Dallas reported a softening in demand for temporary workers. Chicago 

  also experienced a modest decline, but attributed it to a normal seasonal lull.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reports from Kansas City, Minneapolis, and San Francisco indicated that 

  wage increases generally continued to be modest. However, Cleveland noted that 

  in response to the strong pickup in shipping demand, trucking firms have been 

  attempting to expand their workforce by raising their wage rates and offering 

  nonpecuniary incentives. Kansas City also noted higher wages for skilled factory 

  workers in short supply, while Richmond noted that wage increases picked up 

  in the services sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Inflationary pressures remained largely in check in December and early January. 

  While many manufacturers and builders continued to report small increases in 

  input costs, price increases for final goods and services were generally modest.
      </p>
      <p>
       In manufacturing, input prices rose modestly in most districts, but Boston 

  and Minneapolis reported that some input prices rose sharply. Manufacturers 

  of nondurable goods in the Cleveland district noted that prices for raw materials 

  continued to rise, while prices for durable goods inputs were steady. Prices 

  charged by manufacturers increased modestly in Kansas City, New York, and Richmond, 

  and remained in check in Atlanta and Chicago. Increases in the costs of building 

  materials were mixed by district. Modest to sharp price hikes were widely reported 

  in Atlanta, Kansas City, and Minneapolis, but material prices were flat in Cleveland 

  and New York, and eased somewhat in San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, price inflation remained relatively steady in recent weeks. Reports 

  from Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, New York, Richmond, and San Francisco 

  reported that price increases remained largely in check. Contacts in Dallas 

  noted that many firms were unable to pass rising costs along to the customer 

  due to stiff competition, and Chicago noted that competition in the retail sector 

  is expected to limit price increases.
