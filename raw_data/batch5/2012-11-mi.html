      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Ninth District economy experienced moderate growth since the last report.   Increased activity was noted in consumer spending, tourism and professional   services. Some significant parts of construction and real estate are growing at   a double-digit clip. Activity in the energy and mining sectors continued at a   rapid pace. District crop producers remained in mostly good shape, despite this   year's drought. Meanwhile, activity slowed slightly in the manufacturing sector.   While labor markets continued to show signs of tightening in several areas, some   layoff notices were reported. Overall wage increases were moderate, although   stronger increases were reported in some areas. Price increases were generally   modest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending posted   moderate gains. During the past two months, a Minnesota auto dealer reported   strong sales activity for new vehicles and somewhat softer sales activity for   used vehicles. A Minnesota-based restaurant and bar chain reported that recent   same-store sales were up over 5 percent from last year. Same-store sales at a   Minnesota-based retailer increased over 2 percent in October compared with a   year ago. However, a mall manager in the Minneapolis area noted slight decreases   in traffic and sales during September and October compared with last year. In   Montana, a mall manager reported that sales were down slightly during September   after a generally flat summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent travel and tourism activity was above a year ago. Convention and   tourism business in the Sioux Falls, S.D., area was trending above last year's   levels with prospects for a good 2013, according to an official. A travel agency   in Minnesota noted that corporate and leisure travel sales in October were above   year-ago levels. Travel and tourism activity in the Duluth, Minn., area was   above last year, and businesses are optimistic for 2013, according to an   official
       <strong>
        .
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial construction   activity increased significantly since the last report. The permitted value of   new commercial construction in October increased substantially from the same   period last year in Sioux Falls and nearly quadrupled in Billings, Mont. A   recent survey of Minnesota building professionals conducted by a trade   association noted an improvement in market conditions. Residential construction   increased from a year ago. The value of October residential building permits in   the Sioux Falls area was up 16 percent from last year. In the Minneapolis-St.   Paul area, the value of October residential permits was up 70 percent compared   with a year ago, while it tripled in Billings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets expanded at a slow pace. A group of Minnesota   commercial real estate investors and real estate professionals noted a recent   uptick in activity and a reduction in vacancy rates since the last report.   Residential real estate market activity increased. Home sales in October were up   15 percent from the same period a year ago in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area; the   inventory of homes for sale was down 30 percent, and median sales prices rose 15   percent. In the Sioux Falls area, October home sales were up 19 percent,   inventory was down 13 percent and the median sales price was flat relative to a   year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity at professional business services firms   grew since the last report. The aforementioned survey of building professionals   revealed that 59 percent of engineers reported improving conditions compared   with 16 percent who saw declines, while 36 percent of the architect respondents   reported increases and 21 percent noted declines. A marketing consulting firm   noted a large increase in demand from firms that are launching new products or   services. Demand for scientific researchers increased for a large diversified   manufacturing company. A logistics consulting firm noted some disruptions in   rail traffic due to Hurricane Sandy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing slowed slightly since the   last report. An October survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University   (Omaha, Neb.) found that manufacturing activity decreased for a fourth straight   month in Minnesota and South Dakota, but continued to increase in North Dakota.   A wood-products facility in northern Minnesota closed. More than half of   manufacturing respondents to a late-October Minneapolis Fed ad hoc survey   reported that they had cut capital expenditures in the past six months. In   contrast, an agricultural machinery producer announced a $20 million expansion   to a facility in North Dakota, a Minnesota vehicle manufacturer announced a $20   million expansion and a plastic pipe producer broke ground on a new plant in   South Dakota. A maker of outdoor gear is expanding its operations in Minnesota   due to strong demand from the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy and mining   sectors continued at a rapid clip. Oil and gas production remained at record   levels, but exploration activity since the last report was flat in North Dakota   and decreased in Montana. An oil pipeline operator announced capacity expansions   on a pipeline in Minnesota and is considering construction of a high-capacity   line from the North Dakota oil patch to Wisconsin. Sand mining growth continued;   plans for a new loading facility in Minnesota were announced, along with plans   for a rail depot in North Dakota. Iron mines in northern Minnesota remained   busy, but production fell slightly from recent months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District crop producers remained in mostly   good shape, despite this year's drought. Farm incomes were bolstered by high   crop prices, and farmers were looking at record harvests in areas less affected   by drought. However, livestock and dairy producers continued to suffer from   higher input costs. Reports of ranchers culling herds due to low hay production   and increased feed prices continued to surface. After years of delays, a South   Dakota beef slaughter and processing plant began operations in October. Prices   received by farmers for wheat, corn, soybeans, beef, dairy products and chicken   increased in October from a year earlier; hog, dry bean, turkey and egg prices   decreased.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       While labor markets   continued to show signs of tightening in several areas, some layoff notices were   reported. According to the aforementioned survey of building professionals, 31   percent expect to hire more workers during the upcoming year compared with 18   percent in last year's survey. Demand for nurses has picked up in western North   Dakota. A representative of Montana State University noted that job prospects   for graduates have improved. In Minnesota, a manufacturer of equipment used for   transporting and storing natural gas as a liquid broke ground on an expansion   that will add 80 jobs, and a paints and coatings manufacturer recently announced   plans for an expansion that will create about 135 jobs. However, a dairy plant   closing in Minnesota will lead to 130 job reductions by the end of the year, and   an equipment manufacturer announced plans to close a plant, which will affect   100 jobs. Meanwhile, the closing of a pest control product plant in North Dakota   will result in almost 150 job cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wage increases were moderate, with some exceptions noted. Reports of solid   wage increases continued from the oil-drilling area of North Dakota, although   the pace of growth has started to ease recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall price increases were modest. Minnesota gasoline prices decreased   about 50 cents per gallon from early October to mid-November. Some metals prices   also decreased since the last report. In contrast, a bank director noted that   smaller cattle herds will likely keep beef prices elevated. A wood products   industry observer noted some recent increases in prices for oriented strand   board.
