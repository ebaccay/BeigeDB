      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Third  District showed signs of stabilizing during May, overall, as some sectors  strengthened slightly and others weakened. Manufacturers, on balance, reported  nearly steady rates of new orders and shipments in May, after decreases in  April. Retailers continued to post lackluster sales results, with many stores  experiencing year-over-year decreases. Sales of motor vehicles continued to  fall. Bank lending has been increasing slowly. Residential real estate sales  and construction activity remained well below the pace of a year ago, although  there has been a slight seasonal increase in home sales. Commercial real estate  leasing and construction activity has diminished in the past few months.  Reports of increases in input costs and output prices were about as common in  May as they were in April. Employers in the District continued to describe wage  increases as moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among  Third District businesses varies. Manufacturers' forecasts have become more  positive since the last Beige Book. On balance, they expect increases in  shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers generally do not  foresee a significant increase in the sales pace during the summer. Auto  dealers expect sales to weaken further. Bankers anticipate slow expansion in  overall lending. Residential real estate agents and home builders expect sales  to continue to be slow during the next several months despite the recent slight  upturn. Contacts in commercial real estate expect leasing and construction  activity to remain soft until financial conditions improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District  manufacturers reported nearly steady rates of shipments and new orders, on  balance, from April to May. Around one-half of the manufacturers surveyed noted  no change, month-to-month, and the percentage reporting increases was offset by  that of firms reporting decreases. Overall, manufacturers in the District  reported a drop in order backlogs from April to May. Increased demand for their  products was reported by producers of lumber and wood products, furniture, electrical  machinery, and testing and measuring instruments. Decreased demand was noted by  producers of apparel, chemicals, and petroleum products. Several firms reported  that demand for their products was slow "due to low levels of housing  construction" or  "less automotive business."  However, several firms reported that they were benefiting from "strong exports"  or because of the "return of work" that had been done offshore.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in the  Third District manufacturing sector has improved since the last Beige Book.  Around one-half of the manufacturers polled in May expect new orders and  shipments to rise during the next six months, and around one-tenth expect  declines. On balance, manufacturers in the District expect their order backlogs  to grow, and they plan to increase working hours.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers in the Third District  generally reported that sales continued to be slow in May. Results varied  across stores, but on balance sales were level with or somewhat below sales in  May of last year, on a current dollar basis. Some stores reported increases in  sales of big-ticket items, such as appliances and furniture, boosted by  promotions that encouraged shoppers to spend their income tax rebates.  Nevertheless, most of the retailers contacted for this report said the spring  selling season has not met expectations. In general, merchants said low  consumer confidence and rising food and energy costs are deterring  discretionary spending. One retail executive said "high gas and food prices are  sucking money out of retail" and another noted that "consumers will respond  only if you provide value."
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among retailers  in the District remains subdued. Most of those surveyed in May see no signs  that consumer spending will strengthen soon, and they do not expect sales to  pick up significantly until consumer confidence is restored. With an uncertain  outlook, many retail companies in the region are postponing expansion plans and  limiting capital improvements.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the region  generally reported a continuing downward sales trend in May. Although there  were indications that sales of automobiles were increasing, the decline in  sales of light trucks and SUVs has led to a drop in total vehicle sales  compared to a year ago. Dealers in the region expect total vehicle sales to  weaken further during the summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding  loans at Third District banks rose slowly in May. There were gains in all major  credit categories, although real estate loan growth was weak. Bankers said the  slow rate of real estate loan expansion was the result of a low rate of home  sales as well as limits that lenders were imposing on  home-equity lending. Most of the bank lending officers contacted for this  report said that commercial and industrial lending was on the rise. They indicated  that loan demand was coming from firms in many industries and from nonprofit  institutions. However, bankers generally indicated that they were continuing to  limit lending for real estate development. One banker commented that this type  of lending has "ground to a halt." Consumer lending was on the rise, although  some banks noted that credit card loan growth had eased recently. Several banks  reported deterioration in credit quality across all loan categories, although  most indicated that delinquencies and charge-offs have increased only slightly.  In general, banks in the District have continued their efforts to increase  deposits. In contrast to market conditions earlier in the year, however, they  noted that competition for deposits has eased and, as one banker said, "deposit  pricing has become a bit more judicious." Looking ahead, bankers generally  foresee slow growth in overall lending during the rest of the year. They expect  commercial and industrial lending growth to continue at about the current rate,  but some expect a slowing in consumer loan growth, and most anticipate little  or no gain in real estate lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity in the third  District has shown some seasonal improvement in recent weeks but remains well  below the pace of a year ago. Residential real estate agents reported sales of  existing homes were edging up modestly in many parts of the region, and new  home sales have increased slightly in some areas, as well. However, real estate  agents noted that the average time homes are on the market has not declined and  inventories of homes for sale remain high. In general, residential real estate  contacts do not expect housing activity to expand strongly this year. One noted  that the "correction has a year to run at least," and another said "a real  construction rebound will occur in 2009."
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate  firms indicated that construction, leasing, and purchase activity have eased  since the winter. Nevertheless, overall office vacancy rates have edged down in  most markets. Rents have remained stable for class A buildings, but have fallen  for class B buildings. Contacts anticipate that sluggish activity will persist  as long as economic conditions remain uncertain or, as one contact phrased it, "until  the next up-tick in the capital markets."
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of increases in input costs  and output prices from Third District business contacts continued to be as  prevalent in May as in April, and for many of the same goods. Firms in the  region noted increases in the prices of food products, chemicals, industrial  materials, and metals. They also reported rising costs for energy. Firms noted  increases in the prices of a wide range of imported goods, and they expect import prices to rise further. Most of the firms reporting on employment costs  in May indicated that wage increases remained moderate. Some contacts noted  that slower business activity or delays in expansion plans were resulting in  reductions in current and prospective employment.
