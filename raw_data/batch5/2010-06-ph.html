      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity has advanced modestly in the Third District since the last   Beige Book. Manufacturers, on balance, reported increases in shipments and new   orders. Retailers posted sales increases from April to May. Motor vehicle   dealers also indicated that sales increased. Third District banks reported   mostly steady loan volume outstanding. Residential real estate agents and   homebuilders said home sales increased from March to April but slowed in May.   Contacts in the commercial real estate sector said leasing has picked up, but   vacancy rates have not improved, and construction activity continued to be weak.   Service-sector companies generally reported slight gains in activity. Business   firms in the region indicated that prices of most goods and services have been   steady, although there were increased reports of rising prices for basic   materials, construction-related products, and shipping.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among Third District business contacts is positive but cautious,   overall. Manufacturers forecast a rise in shipments and orders during the next   six months, on balance. Retailers expect sales to expand modestly as long as   overall economic conditions and the employment situation improve. Auto dealers   expect the sales rate to increase somewhat in the months ahead. Bankers expect a   slight increase in lending, mostly in commercial and industrial loans.   Residential real estate contacts expect the pace of home sales to ease following   the end of the federal tax credit for purchases. Contacts in nonresidential real   estate expect leasing to increase slowly, but they do not expect any near-term   gains in construction activity. Service-sector companies expect continued modest   growth for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District manufacturers reported   increases in shipments and new orders in May, on balance. Compared with April,   however, the number of firms recording rising orders declined somewhat, although   the number of firms recording rising shipments increased. Among the major   manufacturing industries in the region, increases in orders were more common for   producers of lumber and wood products, industrial materials, and industrial   equipment. In contrast, producers of apparel and electrical equipment reported   mostly declines in orders. In general, manufacturers continued to describe the   increase in demand for their products as slow. One manufacturer said,   "Conditions have improved slightly," and another said, "Activity is showing   signs of improving but at a slow pace."
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, on balance, and the margin of positive opinions over negative   opinions has been practically unchanged since the previous Beige Book. Among the   firms surveyed in May, about half expect increases in new orders and shipments;   a bit over one-tenth expect decreases. Capital spending plans among area   manufacturers remain positive, on balance, but not strong. About one-fourth of   the firms polled in May plan to increase expenditures for new plant and   equipment, but one-half plan to maintain level spending, and nearly one-fifth   expect to reduce spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Third District retailers reported increased sales   in May compared with April and with May of last year. They said that spring   apparel sales continued to rise and that sales of other lines of merchandise had   begun to move up as well. Although some merchants cautioned that much of the   year-over-year improvement in sales was a consequence of last year's poor   results, most said the current trend in sales was encouraging. "It's definitely   a better year than last," one retailer remarked, "and we are selectively   expanding." Looking ahead, Third District retailers expect the sales trend to   remain positive as long as overall economic conditions continue to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District auto dealers reported a rise in sales in May compared with   April and with May of last year. They said a shortage of popular models has   limited the advance in sales, but they expect manufacturers to increase   production soon. Dealers expect sales to continue to move up through the rest of   the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Total outstanding loan volume at most of the   Third District banks contacted for this report has been virtually level since   the last Beige Book. On balance, commercial bank lending officers said there has   been a small increase in business lending, some gains in residential mortgage   lending, but a decline in consumer lending. Bankers generally reported that   demand for business loans has been rising, although some noted that use of   existing credit lines by many commercial customers has been less than expected.   Contacts in the Third District financial community noted recent signs of   increased interest in business lending by non-depository financial companies.   Most of the surveyed banks indicated that credit quality measures have shown   little change since the last Beige Book, although some noted slight improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Looking ahead, Third District bankers expect modest loan growth. They   generally expect gains in business lending. In contrast, several bankers said   they expect a falloff in demand for residential mortgages and continued softness   in consumer loan demand. "Individuals are still deleveraging and looking to   build up cash reserves," one banker said.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in residential real   estate markets reported increases in sales of new and existing homes from March   to April as well as year-over-year gains for both months, but the sales pace   slowed in May. The March-April results were fueled by the federal income tax   credit for home purchases, according to contacts, and they expect the monthly   sales rate to taper off. They expect some sales momentum for existing homes as   recent homebuyers sell their current residences, but slower sales after that.   Many contacts believe "we stole sales from the future," as one real estate agent   said. Although builders reduced inventories of built homes in the past few   months, they do not expect construction activity to pick up this summer. For   both new and existing homes, contacts reported little change in prices compared   with a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential real estate firms indicated that vacancy rates in commercial   and industrial buildings have increased slightly in most parts of the Third   District in the past few months. Leasing activity has picked up somewhat, but   effective rents have been steady to down as recently completed buildings have   added to the supply of available space. Construction activity has been generally   flat at low levels, according to contacts, although some reported increases in   road building and publicly funded projects. Contacts expect leasing activity to   increase slowly in the months ahead and rents to remain about steady. "It will   not be a robust recovery," according to one contact whose opinion reflected the   consensus. Building contractors and commercial real estate agents were in   agreement that construction activity showed no signs of increasing in the near   term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Service-sector firms generally reported that   activity has expanded slightly since the last Beige Book. Business services   firms indicated that client companies in most industry segments have increased   use of their services, with the exception of the construction industry, a sector   in which a recovery has not yet occurred. Several business services firms   reported increased interest in outsourced functions by companies in a range of   industries as well as by state and local governments. Nearly all the services   firms contacted for this report noted that the recent improvement has been   slight. One contact said, "The growth is modest, and the year-over-year   comparison is easy because business was very slow last year." Looking ahead,   most of the services firms contacted for this report expect continued modest   growth for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on input costs and output prices   have been mixed since the last Beige Book, although there has been an increase   in the number of reports of rising prices. Around 40 percent of the   manufacturing firms polled in May noted increases in the costs of the   commodities they use, and 50 percent reported steady input costs. Manufacturers   continued to report rising costs for metals and metal products, and they also   reported increased costs for lumber and chemicals. Most manufacturers said they   have not raised the prices of the products they make, although some producers of   lumber and wood products, metals, and electrical equipment have raised prices.   Construction firms noted increases in the costs of lumber, drywall, oil-based   products, and some metal products. Retailers reported mostly flat selling   prices. However, they noted increases in the cost of cotton goods and   international freight rates. Auto dealers said vehicle selling prices have moved   up, particularly for used cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business firms in the region reported a slight increase in hiring, on   balance, but no significant changes in wages since the last Beige Book. Several   firms noted that recent increases in business activity have prompted them to   consider increasing staffing levels sometime this year. Employment agencies   reported strengthening demand for temporary workers and a slight increase in   demand for permanent employees.
