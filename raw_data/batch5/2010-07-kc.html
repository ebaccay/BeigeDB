      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Tenth District economy generally held steady in June and early July,   despite weak real estate conditions. Consumer spending remained higher than   year-ago levels and was expected to rise over the next three months.   Manufacturing activity expanded slightly, but at a slower pace than in previous   months. Transportation and high-tech firms reported increased activity. As   expected, residential real estate activity contracted sharply in response to the   expiration of tax credits. Commercial real estate conditions weakened, and   activity was expected to slow in the months ahead. Bankers reported slightly   increased loan demand and did not anticipate a change in loan quality over the   next six months. Energy production expanded, raising expectations of increased   employment and capital spending over the coming months. Agriculture conditions   remained positive, and farmland values stayed above year-ago levels. Wage and   retail price pressures remained subdued.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending remained higher than   a year ago, and contacts anticipated gains over the next three months. District   retailers reported that sales in June and July were flat relative to the   previous survey period but remained above year-ago levels. Retailers expected   sales to rise over the next three months and a continued downward trend in   prices. Auto sales increased in response to higher discounts, and dealers   expected strong demand to persist in the coming months. Auto dealers reported   continued declines in inventories. Restaurant sales were flat compared to the   previous survey, but the average check amount fell. Tourism activity rose over   the past month and was expected to remain strong during the summer months. Hotel   occupancy rates increased more than anticipated, but contacts expected to give   up some of these gains in the coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Growth in   manufacturing activity eased slightly in June, while transportation and   high-tech firms reported solid growth in sales and activity. Production at   manufacturing firms continued to rise, but the pace of growth slowed for the   second consecutive month. The volume of new orders, shipments, and finished   goods inventories were flat compared to May, but the backlog of orders at   manufacturing firms declined. Manufacturing activity continued to improve   compared to a year ago, and firms remained optimistic about production and   employment over the next six months. Capital spending continued to decrease   compared to year-ago levels, and firms expected slightly less investment over   the next six months. Transportation firms saw an increase in activity when   compared to both the previous period and a year ago. Some firms continued to   have difficulty finding qualified drivers. Most transportation firms planned to   increase their capital spending the next six to twelve months. The high-tech   industry reported an increase in activity over the previous survey period and   expected strong growth during the next three months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential and commercial   real estate activity declined since the last survey period. With the expiration   of tax credits, residential sales dropped sharply resulting in higher   inventories of unsold homes. Residential real estate contacts continued to   report that lower-priced homes sold better than higher-priced homes. Over the   next three months, real estate agents anticipated slower sales. However,   builders reported higher traffic from potential buyers and expected starts to   rise slightly the next three months. Despite flat construction supply sales   since the previous survey, construction supply contacts also expected sales to   increase during the coming months. Refinancing activity increased amid declining   interest rates. Commercial real estate contacts reported that conditions   weakened after improving slightly in the previous survey, including higher   vacancy rates and declining sales, construction, prices and rents. Commercial   real estate conditions were expected to worsen over the next three months.   Developers reported increasing difficulty accessing credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers reported slightly increased loan demand,   stable deposits, and an unchanged outlook for loan quality. Overall, loan demand   edged up after holding steady in the previous survey. Demand for consumer   installment loans increased. However, demand fell for commercial real estate   loans and was little changed for commercial and industrial loans and residential   real estate loans. Credit standards on residential real estate loans and   consumer installment loans were unchanged, but a few banks tightened standards   on their commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans. About   the same number of bankers reported an improvement in loan quality, compared to   one year ago, as reported a deterioration. Also, for the second straight survey,   respondents expected no change in loan quality over the next six months.   Deposits were unchanged, consistent with their overall stability since late last   year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Energy production continued to expand, and firms   expected activity to grow further in the coming months. Growth in the number of   active drilling rigs slowed relative to strong gains earlier in the year. Crude   oil prices were expected to remain unchanged due to a steadying of supply and   demand conditions. Firms reported that they planned to increase the workforce   the next three months, but some contacts noted difficulty finding qualified   workers. However, they did not anticipate having to raise wages in order to   attract workers. Capital spending was expected to increase over the next six to   twelve months, and several firms mentioned the potential of developing the   Niobrara oil shale in northeastern Colorado and eastern Wyoming.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural conditions remained positive   since the last survey period. Ample moisture reduced the need for irrigation,   and the corn and soybean crops were reported in generally good or better   condition. Wet weather, however, delayed the winter wheat harvest. While many   areas expected an abundant wheat crop, there were some reports of hail damage   and poor quality yields, especially in Oklahoma. Corn and soybean prices held   steady while wheat prices rallied slightly, mainly due to expectations of a   smaller global wheat harvest. Livestock operations continued to be profitable   with recovering demand for beef and pork. Farmland values remained above   year-ago levels. Farm loan demand held steady, and ample funds were available at   low interest rates for qualified borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Wage and retail price pressures remained   low in June and July. District firms reported a slight uptick in the shortage of   qualified labor, but wage pressures stayed at low levels. Retail prices   continued to decline compared to both the last survey period and a year ago.   Builders and construction supply firms expected prices to remain at current   levels over the next three months. Raw material prices at District manufacturers   grew during the survey period, but the pace of growth slowed considerably.   Meanwhile, transportation companies continued to experience higher input prices.   Overall, District contacts planned to keep prices at their current level the   next three months.
