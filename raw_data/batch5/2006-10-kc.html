      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded moderately in September with the pace of 
  growth firming since the last survey period. Consumer spending strengthened 
  with stronger retail sales and tourism activity. The expansion in labor markets, 
  energy activity, and commercial real estate activity advanced further. District 
  manufacturing activity was solid despite expanding at a slower pace and residential 
  real estate activity continued to soften. Agricultural conditions improved slightly 
  with recent precipitation. Wage and wholesale price pressures remained contained 
  and retail price pressures were subdued.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending strengthened in September after growing more slowly in August. 
  District retail contacts reported a rebound in sales and heavier traffic in 
  retail malls. Sales gains were generally broad-based, but contacts suggested 
  some weakness in home furnishings and home improvement items. Retail sales were 
  up from a year ago and retailers expected higher sales in the next three months. 
  Auto dealers reported slower sales growth as fewer incentives were offered. 
  High gas mileage vehicles sold well while truck and SUV sales remained slow. 
  Auto inventories rose in September, but stood at acceptable levels. Auto dealers 
  expected slower auto sales and rising inventories in the months ahead. Travel 
  and tourism activity strengthened in September. District hotels reported solid 
  gains in hotel occupancy rates. Hotel and tourist attraction operators expected 
  activity to improve going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The expansion in district manufacturing activity slowed in September. Plant 
  managers indicated that growth in production, shipments, and new orders slowed 
  since the last survey period, but remained well above year-ago levels. Inventories 
  edged up from August and suppliers to auto manufacturing plants reported slower 
  sales. Still, manufacturers remained optimistic about future sales. Supplier 
  delivery times improved in September. Capital expenditures remained solid as 
  did expectations for future investment.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The residential real estate market continued to soften while commercial real 
  estate activity expanded. Contacts indicated that home starts, traffic of potential 
  buyers, and home prices were down relative to a year ago. Inventories of existing 
  homes rose and contacts reported that the time-on-market for homes lengthened, 
  despite the increased use of concessions to attract buyers. Home sales were 
  soft in most segments of the housing market, with particular weakness in low 
  to moderately priced housing markets. Builders expected home starts to decline 
  further, due in part to normal seasonal slowing. In contrast, commercial real 
  estate activity expanded. Although commercial building starts fell, vacancies 
  were down and absorption was up. Commercial real estate contacts expected activity 
  to remain firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported that loans increased somewhat since the last survey, while 
  deposits held steady. Demand for commercial and industrial loans rose slightly, 
  while demand for other loan categories was generally unchanged. Money market 
  deposits and CDs were higher than in the prior period. Lending rates and standards 
  remained basically unchanged. Overall loan quality improved somewhat compared 
  to the same period a year ago, and respondents expected loan quality to improve 
  moderately in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity continued to expand in the district in September. Oil and gas 
  drilling rig counts remained above year-ago levels. District contacts expected 
  the expansion in energy activity to continue, but at a slower pace. The availability 
  of qualified labor and equipment remained a concern. Demand for gasoline and 
  oil slowed with the end of the summer driving season. Industry contacts, however, 
  expected natural gas prices to rise this winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions generally improved across the district since the last 
  survey in August. Cooler weather and scattered rain helped to improve soil moisture 
  and pastures conditions, but slowed crop maturation and fall harvest. Elsewhere, 
  windy conditions forced some producers to delay winter wheat plantings or risk 
  erosion. Still, producers remained generally optimistic about field conditions 
  going forward. Despite improved pastures, cattle producers may continue to draw 
  down herds to help pastures recover from drought.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to expand while wage pressures remained contained. District 
  hiring announcements continued to outpace layoff announcements. Most contacts 
  continued to report some type of labor shortage, especially for skilled and 
  specialized workers, including engineers, experienced sales workers, oil and 
  gas workers, and manufacturing workers. Some district contacts indicated shortages 
  of entry level positions. The share of businesses experiencing wage pressures 
  eased somewhat since the last survey. Most businesses expected wage gains to 
  be in line with recent wage increases, but some expected that larger wage increases 
  would be needed to attract and retain specialized workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wholesale price pressures continued to ease and retail price pressures remained 
  subdued. Fewer manufacturers reported rising raw materials prices and fewer 
  also expected price increases in the coming months. Nevertheless, prices for 
  raw materials remained high, especially for materials derived from oil and natural 
  gas. The share of manufacturers reporting higher finished goods prices held 
  steady. Looking forward, the share of firms planning output price increases 
  also held steady. District builders indicated that metals prices continued to 
  rise in September. Most retail contacts indicated that prices were stable relative 
  to recent months. Going forward, most retailers expected selling prices to remain 
  flat or rise only marginally.
