      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from District contacts indicated    that economic activity remained mixed from mid-July through August. In the consumer sector, retail sales    improved modestly, the tourist industry indicated strong activity, while    vehicle sales continued to weaken.    Home sales stayed well below year-ago levels in most parts of the    District, and construction levels declined further because of the large    unsold inventory. Contacts indicated    that they expect weakness in housing markets to persist for several months.    Manufacturing activity was mixed, with weakness noted in the building    materials and automotive segments.    Regional freight activity declined.    Banking contacts reported increased loan delinquencies and tighter    lending standards. Labor market conditions were described as being tight,    especially for skilled positions, whereas layoffs continued to increase in    housing-related industries. Overall,    reports on prices and wages indicated no unusual developments. The persistent drought and severe heat in    most areas has adversely affected crop production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer    Spending and Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most reports from District retail    merchants noted that sales improved somewhat in July and August on a    year-over-year basis. Early August    sales-tax holidays appeared to have boosted back-to-school sales in many    areas. The majority of contacts    reported that sales were below plan, but most also expected improved sales    over the next several months. Overall,    the softest retail spending reports continued to come from Florida contacts,    and this is consistent with a weakening pattern of sales-tax revenues in    recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      According    to industry contacts, vehicle sales in July and August remained subdued. Although gasoline prices retreated, auto    dealerships continued to report that fuel economy remains an important    consideration for buyers. Contacts    reported that promotions did little to improve sales, particularly for    full-size trucks and SUVs. Distributors of some regionally produced foreign    brands observed moderately higher sales in July and August, but sales still    lagged behind the national pace for these foreign makes. Industry reports    noted an increase in auto loan delinquencies, higher financing costs for    sub-prime buyers, and a decline in the number of customers financing vehicles    from home-equity lines of credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports indicated positive tourism    activity. Strong hotel bookings were    reported by contacts in Orlando, boosted by robust theme-park    attendance. Also, activity during    August was described as being higher in South Florida than a year earlier.    The recovery of Mississippi's Gulf Coast casinos continued, with revenues in    July exceeding pre-Katrina levels.    Casinos were adding to payrolls, although housing shortages remained a    problem in attracting workers. New    Orleans' Louis Armstrong International Airport reported that passenger    numbers continued to improve only gradually.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Homebuilders and Realtor contacts reported that new and existing    homes sales were well below year-ago levels in July and August, and new    construction declined across the region because of high inventory    levels. Most Florida contacts noted a    sharp drop in new home sales compared with a year ago in July, reversing an    improving pattern of sales in May and June.    The vast majority of contacts expected the weakness in District    housing markets to persist over the next several months. The pace of commercial construction was    described as flat to slightly up in most areas. However, contacts reported a decrease in    the number of projects in the pipeline in Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing    and Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports    on manufacturing activity remained mixed in July and August. Several auto parts manufacturers noted    weaker demand from auto assemblers, and manufacturers of building materials    reported lower orders because of declines in home construction. In both cases, contacts indicated that they    were cutting hours and/or payrolls in response. However, some increases in production were    reported by contacts in other industries, such as carpet production, machine    tools and electrical equipment. In addition, further expansions were    announced for the District's aerospace and defense industry. A number of manufacturers indicated that    they had made significant investment in new energy conservation projects    because of higher energy costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports    from transportation industry contacts indicated weak freight demand. Declines in shipments to and from firms    associated with construction and autos continued to be noted. However, Georgia trucking contacts also    reported that shipments to retailers were slowing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Contacts observed that consumer and mortgage loan delinquencies    increased in some parts of the District in July and August. Some reports also cited increased problems    with commercial customers in the residential building industry. Several banks noted that they had tightened    lending standards for sub-prime customers. Some mortgage brokers have closed    operations in the District, and a large District bank announced it would be    cutting 2,400 jobs by the end of 2008, although that decision was not    attributed to declines in their mortgage business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Labor markets remained tight in some sectors during July and    August. For instance, positions in healthcare, education, accounting, and IT    were reportedly hard to fill.    Increased layoffs were observed in residential construction and    related industries. Price information    was mixed. Some building material costs stabilized. For instance, framing lumber prices were    said to be similar to a year earlier, and were down about 25 percent from two    years ago. Several contacts noted    rising business costs related to electricity, real estate taxes, and    insurance. Wage pressures remained    consistent with the variation in supply and demand across industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Persistently high temperatures and lack of rain worsened    existing drought conditions in much of the region during August. Farm contacts reported significant damage    to crops and pastures. According to    some estimates, the drought could cost Georgia and Florida farmers over $2    billion in lost production. Florida    officials were also concerned about Lake Okeechobee's low water readings,    which have dropped 3-4 feet below normal levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hurricane Dean did not have a    significant impact on energy production along the Louisiana coast. Crude oil    deliveries to refineries in the Gulf of Mexico region reached its highest    post-Hurricane Katrina level in late July.
