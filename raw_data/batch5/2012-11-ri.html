      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Fifth District economic activity strengthened at a tempered pace since our last   report. Manufacturing activity improved, retail sales increased moderately, and   customer demand rose modestly at non-retail services firms. Reports on banking   conditions were mixed, and mortgage refinancing bolstered consumer lending. Real   estate markets also strengthened, with both residential and commercial contacts   reporting an uptick in activity. In contrast, labor market activity slowed since   our last report. Also, tourism contacts noted a seasonal decline in   reservations. Agricultural conditions were favorable before Hurricane Sandy   arrived, although some farmers in the District were affected by the storm.   Manufacturers' input prices and finished goods prices rose at a slower rate,   while wages rose more quickly. The pace of service providers' price increases   edged up and non-retail wage growth slowed. Price increases slowed at retailers,   while wages rose at a faster pace. Several businesses lost power during   Hurricane Sandy, but most returned quickly to normal operations. In addition, we   received reports of supplier issues and less customer traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
        <br/>
       </strong>
       District manufacturing activity continued   to improve modestly. A manufacturer of dental products reported an increase in   orders and commented that his company would finish the year slightly ahead of   2011. A manufacturer of organizational products said that he expected shipments   to remain high; he remarked that his company was picking up market share through   consolidation in the industry. A producer of plastic components noted a pickup   in activity after several months of reduced orders. In addition, an aerospace   manufacturer reported that the company is expanding and is completing a new   manufacturing facility. According to our latest survey, both raw materials and   finished goods prices rose at a slower pace since our last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Retail contacts reported a moderate acceleration   in sales during late October and early November. Hardware and home and garden   stores noted higher demand for storm-related items ahead of Hurricane Sandy.   Quipped one executive, "Bad weather is good for business." A store manager at a   department store reported that his sales were stable, although he is competing   with his suppliers for online sales. Car and light truck dealers gave mixed   reports. Dealers in Maryland and West Virginia saw a drop in sales, however a   West Virginia dealer recently completed expansion at his location to accommodate   additional inventory for ongoing strong sales, and a North Carolina dealer   commented that year-over-year sales were mostly strong across the board. The   pace of retail price increases slowed since our last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Executives at services firms generally reported   a modest rise in customer demand since our last report, especially at   professional, scientific, and technical firms. Additionally, several   architectural and engineering firms indicated that their business strengthened   somewhat. Although financial services firms reported that activity had improved,   a central Virginia broker commented that clients "remained conservative" and   were evaluating alternative plans in case the economy worsens. Contacts at   healthcare organizations noted little change in demand other than typical   seasonal expansion. However, freight trucking firms reported slight softening in   the industry. Service providers noted a minor pickup in the pace of price   increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Reports on banking conditions varied widely since   our last report. An official for a large bank stated that business borrowing   softened over the last six weeks, while mortgage demand edged higher. A West   Virginia banker said that home equity loans were down, in part due to consumers   rolling that debt into their mortgage. A small commercial banker in Virginia   described demand in general as improving slightly, but added that consumer loans   were unchanged from "meager" levels and small business loans were virtually   non-existent. Several loan officers noted that an exception to weak consumer   demand was auto loans, but one banker said that even those had weakened in   recent weeks. A credit union loan manager reported that consumer loan   applications were up and he expected modest gains to continue. Overall loan   demand strengthened, according to a northern Virginia banker, mostly for auto   loans, home mortgage refinancing, and equipment purchases. Several officials   also expressed concern that banks were increasing their risk by making longer   termed loans in an effort to get higher yields. Yet, most bankers stated that   the quality of their loan portfolio remained healthy, with few delinquencies in   recent months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Residential real estate activity improved   modestly since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area said that   closings were up double digits compared to a year ago. He noted that inventory   is very low and prices continued to rise. A contact in South Carolina reported   that the single-family segment in the Myrtle Beach market was particularly   robust, although the area continued to work down a glut of inventory in the   condominium market. A builder in South Carolina cited significant pent-up demand   in the first time buyer segment, because many could not get financing, although   the move-up market improved. Another builder in South Carolina stated that   inventories were moving toward balance and he believed that a real recovery was   underway. Similarly, another source reported that there was a steady, slow   improvement, and that foreclosures were falling. A contact in Charlotte noticed   more residential work in the high-end home category for the first time in more   than three years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate and construction improved slightly over the last few   months. While some contacts stated that activity remained weak and little   changed from the summer months, most contacts reported modest gains in at least   some segments of their local market. A real estate representative in the   Baltimore area said that her third quarter market report showed "grinding and   gradual improvement," with the majority of growth in the Baltimore-DC region. A   developer in the Carolinas reported that absorption rates in the office segment   were improving, even though vacancy rates remained elevated. Other contacts also   noted tightening of available office space, especially among Class A properties,   but attributed some of that gain to the lack of new construction. A Charlotte   Realtor described his market as "choppy," with downtown office space faring   better than suburban locations. He also noted some tightening in industrial   space, due mostly to expansion of distribution and call center demand. Several   contacts, especially in Virginia, noted slight improvements in retail vacancy   rates for restaurants and apparel stores. Most Realtors reported modest firming   in leasing rates, although concessions on long-term leases were occasionally   available. While several contractors noted a slowdown in government and   education-related projects, private sector projects were edging forward, most   notably for strip malls in underserved areas and for distribution centers near   major retail markets. Additionally, a contact reported expanding activity at   industrial and health care facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Markets
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Labor markets were more negative on balance   than in our last report.
       <strong>
       </strong>
       Employment agencies reported somewhat   stronger demand for temporary workers, but reiterated their difficulty finding   qualified workers to fill open positions in manufacturing, aerospace, defense,   automotive, and construction. A contact in South Carolina said that labor demand   remained fairly soft, with the exception of some IT positions, noting that   hiring came to a stop in the third quarter. A Charlotte area temp agency   executive reported that manufacturers were unwilling to hire long-term   unemployed workers because their skills may have diminished. Manufacturers   worried that taking on talent at reduced wages might lead to more turn-over when   the economy picks up. A North Carolina contact commented that college graduates   who were unable to find full-time work were choosing to remain on unemployment   rather than take part-time positions. According to contacts, retail wage growth   picked up, while wages at non-retail services firms rose more slowly;   manufacturing wage growth also edged up.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Most tourism contacts reported seasonally slower   autumn bookings. Several added that, at this time of year, they focus on   attracting tourists who are located within a day's drive. There were scattered   reports of storm-related hotel cancellations caused by Hurricane Sandy, as   tourists from outside the District were affected by the weather at home. In   addition, a couple of contacts noted some patches of beach and highway erosion   on the Outer Banks of North Carolina and storm-related snow in parts of West   Virginia, which might affect near-term visits. However, most planned events   continued on schedule. A few District hoteliers stated that they were able to   raise rates slightly since our last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Agricultural conditions prior to Hurricane   Sandy remained favorable. Strong income boosted farm loan repayment rates.   Lenders reported a drop in the number of loan renewals and extensions, even as   spending for agricultural equipment rose. During October, beef prices rose as   farmers struggled with higher feed costs--some producers culled herds, including   breeding stock. More recently, Hurricane Sandy's damage was minimal and   localized mainly in coastal areas. In Maryland, an analyst reported that small   grain emergence may be affected by standing water and salt water flooding. Snow   and cold temperatures in North Carolina hindered farm activity and livestock   producers were forced to begin feeding hay due to snow covered pastures; fruit   production was not affected. In contrast, most farmers in Virginia were relieved   that Hurricane Sandy brought much needed rain without significant damage to the   corn and soybeans still in the field.
