      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Twelfth District economy posted further modest improvement during the   reporting period of early April through the end of May. Despite rising prices   for some non-oil commodities, price increases for final goods and services   remained restrained, and upward wage pressures were largely absent. Demand for   retail items and services continued to strengthen, but sales remain well below   pre-recession levels. Manufacturing activity in the District continued to firm,   with additional improvement noted in sectors such as wood products and metal   fabrication, which have been among those most troubled. Agricultural producers   reported solid sales, while demand was mixed for providers of natural resource   products. Demand for housing appeared to hold largely steady, but conditions in   commercial real estate weakened further. Banking contacts reported stable to   slightly increased lending activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures remained limited   on net during the reporting period. While the price of oil came down in recent   weeks, the prices of other selected commodities, such as steel, copper, and   concrete, rose. Additionally, contacts continued to report price increases for   transportation services. Given the weak overall level of demand, however, the   final prices for a wide variety of retail items and services continued to be   held down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were largely absent, although reports continued to   point to notable increases in employee benefit costs. Compensation gains   remained constrained by high unemployment and limited hiring throughout the   District. Compared to the same period a year ago, the majority of respondents   expect wages to remain largely stable or rise slightly in the second half of   2010, while they anticipate that benefit costs, especially for health insurance,   will increase more significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales remained somewhat   lackluster on net but continued to improve modestly. Both traditional department   stores and discount chains reported additional increases in sales, and although   consumers remained focused on necessities, contacts noted further increases in   demand for some nonessential items and higher-priced options. Sales remained   strong for grocers and continued to improve for sellers of furniture and   household appliances. Similarly, retailers of home remodeling supplies and   equipment saw robust levels of activity. Sales of new automobiles improved a bit   further during the reporting period, although contacts cautioned that demand has   slipped somewhat in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for services showed further signs of improvement but remained weak   overall. Providers of health-care services reported relatively steady levels of   activity, while energy utilities reported increased demand from households and   from firms in selected industries, such as technology and wood products.   Similarly, restaurants and other food-service firms noted continued modest   increases in demand. Sales remained sluggish for providers of professional and   media services. Conditions continued to improve in the tourism and leisure   sector: Contacts in many of the District's major markets reported increases in   visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates, and, notably, reports pointed to   positive developments in business travel and convention activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity picked up   further on balance during the reporting period of early April through the end of   May. Conditions continued to improve for manufacturers of semiconductors and   other information technology products, with balanced inventories and high levels   of capacity utilization noted. An extensive order backlog generally held   production rates at a steady pace for makers of commercial aircraft and parts,   although new orders continued to be limited. Capacity utilization remained at   very low levels for companies in the metal fabrication and wood product sectors,   but further modest improvement in demand was reported. Food manufacturers   witnessed continued growth in new orders and sales with high levels of capacity   utilization.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand stayed   solid for agricultural producers but was mixed for extractors of natural   resources used for energy production. Sales held largely steady for a variety of   crop and livestock products, and reports from agricultural contacts indicated   little change in input costs. Oil extraction activity decreased somewhat in   recent weeks as the price of oil declined. Meanwhile, despite high levels of   inventory, extraction of natural gas increased modestly as demand showed signs   of firming.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for housing in the   District appeared to be little changed from the previous period, while demand   for commercial real estate deteriorated a bit further. Home prices continued to   edge up in some parts of the District, and although the pace of home sales   remained mixed across areas, it appeared largely stable on net. However,   contacts continued to note that the limited availability of nonconforming   "jumbo" loans has restricted sales of higher-priced homes in some areas.   Scattered reports pointed to some modest improvements in residential   construction, most notably in the repair and remodel sector. Conditions worsened   somewhat further in commercial real estate markets, with vacancy rates for   office and industrial space edging up in many parts of the District. However,   contacts reported continued improvements in leasing activity for some market   segments of the District as tenants seek to secure favorable terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand was largely stable or slightly up compared   with previous reporting periods. Businesses' cautious attitudes towards capital   spending continued to restrain commercial and industrial loan volumes; however,   reports indicated a pickup in loan demand coming from selected businesses that   are planning to replace worn or outdated equipment and software. Demand for   consumer loans remained weak on net. Lending standards continued to be   relatively restrictive for consumer and business lending, although reports   suggested that credit quality may be stabilizing. Going forward, continued   modest improvement in commercial and industrial loan demand seems likely;   overall, respondents expect capital spending in equipment and software to   increase further in the second half of 2010, although capital spending in   structures is anticipated to remain lackluster.
