      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has expanded at a somewhat more moderate 

  pace since the last report than in earlier periods. Reports on the labor market 

  have been mixed but, on balance, a bit softer. Retailers generally report that 

  sales were strong in June, though a number indicate some softening in early 

  July. Tourism activity was robust in June. While housing markets continue to 

  be characterized as sturdy, there has been some deceleration in selling prices 

  and a modest dip in activity since the last report. Office markets strengthened 

  moderately in the second quarter, but the market for industrial space was mixed. 

  New York City's financial industry has shown signs of improvement in early 

  July, after a sluggish second quarter; moreover, hiring activity is said to 

  have picked up and compensation has accelerated. Manufacturers and purchasing 

  managers report a considerable diminution of input price pressures in June and 

  early July. Finally, bankers report a pickup in demand for commercial mortgages 

  but little change in other loan categories; they also report some tightening 

  in credit standards and further declines in delinquency rates.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retailers report that sales were generally on or above plan in June, but have 

  softened and appear to be a bit below plan in early July. After a relatively 

  cool spring, unseasonably hot weather in June boosted sales of summer merchandise--particularly 

  apparel. More generally, sales of premium lines of clothing were characterized 

  as strong, as were sales of jewelry and accessories. However, sales of home-related 

  goods were weak across the board. In general, retail inventories were said to 

  be at desired levels at the end of June, though a number of wholesale trade 

  contacts indicate that inventories were on the high side. Selling prices were 

  little changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism continued to show strength in June. Manhattan's hotel occupancy 

  rate climbed above 90 percent in June--close to a record high and up more 

  than 3 percentage points from a year earlier; moreover, with average room rates 

  up nearly 18 percent from a year earlier, total revenues are up more than 20 

  percent over the past 12 months. Similarly, Broadway theaters indicate that 

  attendance remained robust in June, with revenues running roughly 10 percent 

  ahead of a year earlier, though attendance has tapered off moderately in the 

  first half of July.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer confidence improved in June, based on two separate surveys. The Conference 

  Board's survey of Middle Atlantic residents shows consumer confidence 

  rebounding strongly in June, after slipping to a 6-month low in May. Siena College's 

  survey of New York State residents shows confidence climbing for the second 

  month in a row--whereas May's gain was concentrated in the New York 

  City metropolitan area, all of the June gain was in upstate New York.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The housing market generally continued to be robust in June and early July, 

  though there were some signs of slowing in activity and deceleration in prices. 

  New Jersey homebuilders report that conditions remain strong, though the rate 

  of price increase has slowed; residential construction activity has been stronger 

  in 2005 than it has been since the late 1980s, but there is still a fairly long 

  queue of homebuyers. Two contacts maintain that Manhattan's co-op and 

  condo market remains robust across the board, though not as frenzied as during 

  the spring. Apartment prices were estimated to be running 10 percent to 15 percent 

  higher than a year earlier in June--a bit less than in April and May--while 

  unit sales were down moderately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office markets in and around New York City have continued to show signs of 

  strengthening. At the end of June, office vacancy rates declined to 4-year lows 

  in both Midtown and Lower Manhattan, and this improving trend has continued 

  during the first half of July. Similarly, Westchester County's vacancy 

  rate fell to a 5-year low at mid-year, while Fairfield County's rate was 

  down slightly for the quarter. In Long Island, however, vacancy rates rose by 

  nearly a full point in the second quarter, though they are still 1/2 point 

  lower than a year earlier. Industrial markets in and around New York City were 

  mixed in the second quarter. Industrial vacancy rates edged down to near a 3-1/2 

  year low in Fairfield County and were steady at record lows in Westchester County; 

  rents in both areas were up slightly from a year earlier. In New York City, 

  Long Island, and northern New Jersey, industrial vacancy rates were little changed, 

  though asking rents were up roughly 10 percent from a year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A contact at a major New York City employment agency describes the job market 

  as lukewarm, noting that hiring activity has been a bit slower in June and early 

  July than anticipated. In contrast, a contact in the financial industry notes 

  that employment and compensation have accelerated in recent months; more generally, 

  business activity is said to have picked up in early July, after a sluggish 

  second quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our latest survey, New York State manufacturers report a further 

  rebound in activity in early July and have become increasingly optimistic about 

  the near-term outlook. Still, hiring activity is reported to have slowed, and 

  a number of contacts indicate that inventories are higher than desired. They 

  also note a marked deceleration in input prices, and anticipate substantially 

  less upward pressure on prices in the months ahead. Regional surveys of purchasing 

  managers also point to considerable moderation in input price pressures.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Small and medium sized banks in the district report little change in demand 

  for consumer loans, residential mortgages, and commercial and industrial loans 

  since the last report, but an increase in demand for commercial mortgages. Refinancing 

  activity continued to weaken. Bankers reported tightened standards on residential 

  mortgages, consumer loans and commercial mortgages. Higher rates were reported 

  across all loan categories, particularly in the consumer loan category. Increased 

  average deposit rates were reported by 67 percent of bankers versus only 6 percent 

  reporting lower rates. Finally, banks report lower delinquency rates on consumer 

  loans, commercial mortgages, and commercial and industrial loans.
