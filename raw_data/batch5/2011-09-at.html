      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic activity continued   to expand at a very subdued pace in July and August. Retail sales grew more   slowly than during the previous reporting period, although tourism activity   remained solid. Existing home sales improved in Florida, but were weak elsewhere   in the District. New home sales and construction were soft and downward pressure   on prices persisted for both existing and new homes. Contractors reported low   levels of commercial development. Manufacturing contacts indicated that the   level of production and new orders increased, but at a slower pace than   experienced earlier in the year. Bankers noted ongoing weakness in loan demand   as both consumers and businesses were restrained in their borrowing activity.   Most businesses continued to be cautious regarding adding permanent staff, with   several indicating that they had chosen to hire temporary or contract workers to   fill immediate labor needs. Contacts reported that on average, sales prices were   up slightly from a year ago, although some retailers mentioned that weak sales   were prompting them to lower prices. Energy contacts indicated plans to increase   oil production capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Consumer Spending and Tourism
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most District merchants   reported that retail sales growth had slowed in July and August. Businesses   noted a drop in sales and traffic compared with a year ago. The majority of   contacts stated that they were keeping inventory levels lean and had no plans to   increase supply in the near term. The outlook among most retailers was less   optimistic than earlier in the year, although some contacts noted that the costs   of cotton-based inputs for the spring selling season will not be as high as   initially feared.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism activity remained robust in the District. Hospitality industry   reports cited increases in occupancy and room rates. Airport traffic was up,   particularly in South Florida, which serves as a point of entry for cruise line   travel as well as international travel from Latin America. Although some   companies noted that the softer economic climate has led to a decline in advance   bookings from business travelers, the overall outlook among contacts remained   strong for the coming months.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The majority of District   residential brokers reported that sales were slightly ahead of last year's weak   levels. Most of the increase came from Florida contacts, although several   brokers there stated that a decline in bank-owned homes available to purchase   had held sales back somewhat. Outside Florida, brokers found that sales were   similar to last year's levels. The majority of brokers indicated that housing   inventories remained elevated. Brokers continued to note downward pressure on   home prices with most indicating that prices were flat to slightly down compared   with a year ago. The outlook weakened over the reporting period with most   contacts anticipating sales growth to be down slightly over the next several   months.
       </p>
       <p>
        District builders reported that new home sales and construction activity were   similar to year earlier levels. New home inventory levels declined somewhat, but   builders noted downward pressure on new home prices nonetheless. Residential   contractors indicated that home improvement construction improved from earlier   in the year. Compared with the June report, builders' outlook weakened somewhat   with the majority of contacts expecting new home sales growth to be flat over   the next several months and construction to be similar to last year's weak   levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial contractors signaled that nonresidential construction was slow,   although activity in the healthcare sector continued to be positive. Contacts   reported aggressive bidding by contractors and subcontractors. On the leasing   side, firms noted that the absorption of space had slowed somewhat in recent   weeks. Overall, the outlook for construction and leasing activity weakened   somewhat from previous months.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing and Transportation
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Manufacturers indicated   that the level of new orders and production increased in mid-July and August,   but at a slower pace than earlier this year. A leading auto dealer and many   parts suppliers felt that the impact of supply disruptions from Japan had ended.   A large tire manufacturer noted particular pressure in meeting a recent surge in   orders as the supply chain normalized from the disaster in Japan. Many   manufacturers reported increased investment in technology equipment in efforts   to increase efficiency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Railway firms cited increased capital expenditures, above-trend plans to   hire, and strengthening exports--particularly coal. Trucking contacts expressed   continued labor supply issues and elevated fuel costs, and have also projected   demand for the remainder of the year to be somewhat softer than previously   anticipated.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Banking and Finance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Bankers noted ongoing weakness in   loan demand as both consumers and businesses were restrained in borrowing   activity. Credit standards at banks and credit unions were little-changed and   some firms, such as newer businesses or those related to real estate, reported   difficulty obtaining loans. Contacts at large companies indicated they did not   have many issues with credit availability. Many mentioned self-funding capital   projects through the use of cash reserves or retained earnings. Some businesses   signaled that they did not need additional credit, but had access to funds while   others with financial issues struggled to get bank credit.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Employment and Prices
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Most businesses reported muted   hiring activity. Many held the view that sales are the key factor in determining   labor demand, and uncertainty about future sales seems to be exacerbating firms'   unwillingness to commit to full-time employees. Hence, companies continued to   hire temporary workers and contractors and are delaying longer-term projects.   Many noted focusing on efficiency and productivity increases with existing staff   to meet current or any seasonal increase in demand. Wage increases were   reportedly subdued, with many business contacts opting for cash bonuses and   restoration of benefits over annual salary increases.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pricing information was mixed. Contacts reported that on average, sales   prices were up slightly from a year ago, although some retailers mentioned that   weak sales were prompting them to lower prices. Fewer manufacturers reported   higher input prices than in previous months. Firms noted that they continued to   face cost pressures, particularly from high materials and freight costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Natural Resources and Agriculture
        </strong>
        <br/>
        The number of oil and   gas rigs operating in the Gulf of Mexico has continued its gradual ascent in   recent months. However, the current rig count is only about two-thirds of the   number of offshore rigs in operation before the spring 2010 Gulf oil spill.   Despite the recent decline in oil prices, contacts in the energy equipment   fabrication business reported ongoing backlogs in orders for pipelines, supply   boats, and drilling equipment. Energy producers are moving forward with plans to   invest in increased oil production capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        While most of the District continued to experience varying degrees of drought   conditions, recent rains have provided relief to some of the region's stressed   pastures and crops. Cotton prices were up compared with last year but have   fallen from record highs. Peanut producers expect prices to increase as supply   from areas outside of the District becomes constrained as a result of adverse   weather.
