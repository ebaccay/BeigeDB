      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that the pace of   economic activity remained slow in September. Retailers noted a decrease in   traffic and sales. The hospitality sector improved, although some areas   continued to be affected by the lingering impact of the Gulf oil spill. Realtors   and homebuilders cited further weakening in home sales and increasing   inventories, while the pace of nonresidential construction was soft.   Manufacturers reported that new orders grew at a slower pace and production was   flat. Provision of bank credit continued to be constrained and loan demand   remained weak. District labor markets continued to recover slowly, although many   businesses relied on increased hours for existing staff and expanded their use   of temporary hires rather than adding permanent employees. Some transportation   and material prices rose slightly, but firms continued to report limited pass   through to consumers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District merchants   reported that traffic and sales decreased in September and that they are   intentionally keeping inventory levels low. Contacts noted that low-end products   and apparel were strong sellers, however, and the outlook among retailers   improved only modestly from previous reports. District automobile dealers   indicated that vehicle sales were ahead of year-ago levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity across much of the District improved and the outlook for the   remainder of the year was positive. Cruise bookings and pricing increased and   contacts reported that discretionary spending on board rose. The impact of   summer cancelations continued to be felt in many Gulf Coast destinations.   However, the losses experienced in these areas have been largely offset by an   increase in activity in Northeast Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District residential   real estate contacts reported that home sales weakened further in September,   although several Florida brokers indicated that declines moderated. Many   builders and Realtors noted that potential buyers remained on the sidelines and   that acquiring mortgage financing had become more difficult recently. Cash   buyers, particularly in Florida markets where price declines have been   pronounced, continued to purchase homes at a strong pace. New home construction   softened further from low levels. Brokers indicated that existing home listing   inventories continued to rise on a year-over-year basis. Builders reported that   new inventories remained below the year-earlier level, but were rising. Both   brokers and homebuilders reported persistent downward pressure on home prices.   Homebuilders, in particular, were concerned about the number of foreclosed and   bank-owned properties coming to market. The outlook among contacts regarding   sales over the next several months was weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity remained soft across the District.   Contractors noted that the pace of commercial development was below the   year-earlier level and backlogs remained low. Contacts continued to report high   vacancy rates and downward pressures on rents. The outlook for the rest of the   year remained negative.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturers   indicated that the growth of new orders slowed notably and that production was   flat in September compared to the previous month. However, many respondents   planned modest production increases in the short-term. District transportation   contacts noted an overall decrease in domestic freight demand; however, this was   countered by an increase in international shipments. Rail companies reported   positive but slower growth of shipments of automobiles and industrial goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking conditions remained   weak as bank profitability continued to be challenged by elevated loan losses   and high levels of noncurrent loans. Loan demand also remained soft. Business   contacts continued to indicate an expansion of trade credit to create and extend   lines of credit outside of the traditional banking infrastructure.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to   recover in September, albeit slowly. Contacts reported that they remain   reluctant to hire additional full-time, permanent employees because of the   uncertain outlook regarding future sales and orders. Many firms continued to   note a strong preference for increasing existing staff hours and using part-time   or temporary staff rather than hiring full-time staff. Firms that were hiring   noted they were being very deliberate in order to get the best possible   candidate from a large applicant pool.
     </p>
     <p>
      District contacts reported that firms were resisting passing higher input   costs through to consumers given the ongoing softness in sales. As a result,   margins remained very thin. A number of manufacturers indicated that rising   costs of materials and employee benefits were likely to be passed on to   customers over the next 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional oil production   continued to rise and the Gulf of Mexico crude inventories remained near the top   of their average range for this time of year. Local gasoline stocks have been   declining since mid-August, as large surpluses were drawn down somewhat.   Following the capping of the Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico, clean   up and oil recovery efforts continued with ongoing environmental testing for   contaminants in the water and in local fish populations.
     </p>
     <p>
      District crops were troubled by high temperatures and dry weather in   September that resulted in early harvesting. Soil moisture levels were reported   as extremely low in areas of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Regional   cotton plantings were much higher than a year earlier.
