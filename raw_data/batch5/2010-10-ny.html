      Beige Book Report: New York

       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy continued to expand at a modest pace since the   last report. Input prices have risen somewhat, while consumer prices remain   steady. General merchandise retailers report that sales were mixed but, on   balance, steady and close to plan; auto dealers in upstate New York report that   sales held up fairly well in August and September and that credit conditions   continued to improve. Commercial real estate markets have generally been steady   since the last report. Residential real estate sales markets were generally   stable across the District, while New York City's rental market showed continued   modest improvement. Manufacturing-sector contacts report some pickup in business   during September and early October, after a pause in August. Tourism activity in   New York City, though still fairly brisk, has shown some signs of cooling since   the last report. The labor market has been mixed recently: manufacturers   continue to add jobs and firms in a wide variety of industries plan to increase   employment in the months ahead; however, contacts in New York City report that   the financial industry continues to shed jobs and that hiring for office and   administrative jobs generally remains sluggish. Finally, bankers report little   change in loan demand, lower delinquency rates on consumer loans, and ongoing   tightening in credit standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      General merchandise retailers report   that sales have been mixed since the last report, with same store sales running   roughly on par with a year ago and on or close to plan in September. Stores in   Manhattan fared somewhat better than in the rest of the region, evidently helped   by brisk tourism. One major retail chain notes that sales of seasonal apparel   were sluggish due to unseasonably mild weather but that sales in most other   categories were fairly good; this contact expects holiday season sales to be up   roughly 3 percent from 2009 on a same-store basis. Another contact at a major   mall in upstate New York indicates a sharp uptick in sales toward the end of   September. Some New York State retailers express concern about the recent   reinstatement of the state sales tax on clothing under $110, though it is too   early to gauge any effect on sales. Inventories are generally reported to be at   favorable levels, while prices remain steady; merchandise acquisition costs have   also been steady. A few major retail contacts indicate that they plan to hire   more holiday-season staff than in 2009. Auto dealers in upstate New York report   that sales of new vehicles held up fairly well in August and September, though   the cash-for-clunkers program last summer adversely affected year-ago   comparisons. Sales and prices of used cars have reportedly been buoyed somewhat   by strong demand and lean inventories of new vehicles. Auto dealers report   continued improvement in credit conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity in New York City, though still fairly brisk, has shown some   signs of cooling since the last report. Manhattan hotels report that occupancy   rates remained close to 90 percent in September, while room rates continued to   run 10-15 percent ahead of a year earlier. However, there are scattered reports   of weaker than expected advance bookings for October, which may reflect some   softening in business travel. Broadway theaters report that revenue weakened   noticeably in September and was down roughly 10 percent from a year earlier;   this reflects some recent tapering off in both attendance and ticket prices, the   latter of which was down roughly 6 percent from a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Separately, consumer confidence remained steady in September, though at   depressed levels. The Conference Board reports that confidence among residents   of the Middle Atlantic region (NY, NJ, PA) edged up in September, after falling   to a more than one-year low in August; Siena College's September survey of New   York State residents shows confidence holding steady in both upstate and   downstate--also at weak levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing markets have been   mixed but generally stable since the last report. Real estate contacts in both   northern New Jersey and western New York State report that sales activity has   remained exceptionally weak as the usual seasonal pickup in September has not   occurred. The ongoing weakness was partly attributed to the expiration of the   home-buyers tax credit, which is believed to have pulled sales forward from the   second half of 2010. Prices are characterized as relatively stable in upstate   New York and drifting down in northern New Jersey, where one industry contact   notes a sizable inventory of distressed properties on the market. Manhattan's   co-op and condo market was stable in the third quarter: sales activity was   steady, after accounting for a normal seasonal dip, and prices were steady to   down slightly overall. Manhattan's apartment rental market improved modestly:   effective rents are estimated to be rising moderately, as landlords pull back on   concessions. New leasing activity picked up noticeably in the quarter--largely   attributed to renters moving in response to the end of concessions on lease   renewals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office markets across the District softened modestly since the last report.   Asking rents continued to drift down in Manhattan and northern New Jersey but   were mostly steady in other parts of the region. In Manhattan, office vacancy   rates retreated in August and September, after rising in July. In most of the   District, though, vacancy rates have edged up since the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A major New York City employment   agency, specializing in office and administrative jobs, reports that hiring   activity was disappointingly sluggish in September--particularly from financial   firms. Similarly, a contact in the financial industry notes that employment   continues to drift down, as the pace of layoffs appears to have picked up a bit   lately; some financial firms are reported to be in the market for lawyers and   accountants but are not hiring much in other areas. Moreover, recent weakening   in revenues is said to be constraining compensation at these firms, and year-end   bonuses (typically paid out in January) are projected to be lower than this past   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing firms in the District report a pickup in activity in September,   following a pause in July and August, and a growing proportion of manufacturing   contacts indicate that they are increasing employment and plan to add more   workers in the months ahead. Non-manufacturing contacts also report some pickup   in business activity and have grown substantially more optimistic about the   general business outlook. Both manufacturers and other firms report a moderate   increase in input price pressures but only modest changes in selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small to medium-sized banks report   that loan demand was generally steady overall: respondents indicate a moderate   decrease in demand for consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans, but a   moderate increase in demand for residential mortgages; demand for commercial   mortgages was little changed. Bankers also note a continued increase in   refinancing activity. Credit standards are reported to have tightened for   commercial and industrial loans and mortgages, with no reports of easing   standards in these categories; however, banks report little or no change in   credit standards for consumer loans and residential mortgages. Bankers'   responses suggest some decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for   residential mortgages but no change in spreads in the other loan categories.   Respondents indicate ongoing widespread decreases in the average deposit rate.   Finally, bankers report a decrease in delinquency rates for consumer loans but   little or no change for other loan categories. Separately, contacts at credit   unions indicate that credit conditions and business activity generally remain   steady.
