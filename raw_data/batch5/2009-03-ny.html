      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has weakened noticeably  since the last report.  In general,  contacts in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors report  broad-based deterioration in general business conditions in recent weeks and  most do not anticipate improvement in the months ahead.  In particular, contacts report widespread  softening in the labor market, especially in New York City.  Retail sales were sluggish in January, though  not down as sharply as in December, while consumer confidence remained near  record lows.  Tourism activity in New  York City weakened substantially in January and in early February.  Both  residential and commercial real estate markets deteriorated since the last  report, though housing markets in parts of upstate New York appeared relatively  stable.  Finally, bankers report that  refinancing stabilized demand for home mortgages but that demand for other  categories of loans declined further; they also report further tightening in  credit standards and higher delinquency rates--especially on loans to the  household sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales were sluggish in January, though  year-on-year declines were less pronounced than in December.  New York State reports that sales tax  revenues for the month were down modestly from a year ago, following a steep  decline in December.  Retailers in  western New York report that business from Canadian shoppers has weakened in  recent months, partly attributed to a pullback in the Canadian dollar.  Consumer surveys show confidence remaining  near record lows.  The Conference Board  reports that consumer confidence among residents of the Middle Atlantic states  (NY, NJ, PA) edged up from a record low in January. Similarly, Siena College's  monthly survey of New York State residents showed confidence edging up for the  second consecutive month, after falling to a record low in November.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity in New York City has slowed  substantially since the last report.   Manhattan hotels report marked weakening in business thus far in 2009,  following a moderate pickup in December.   Revenues per room are reported to have fallen by a record 30 percent  from a year earlier in January and appear to be running nearly 40 percent lower  in February.  Occupancy tumbled roughly 15  percent from a year earlier in January, while average room rates fell 15  percent.  While much of the weakness  reflects softening demand, an industry contact notes that about half the  decline in occupancy rates is due to new hotels opening; the total number of  hotel rooms in Manhattan is expected to increase by roughly 7,000 (10 percent)  in 2009, or more than triple the net increase in 2008.  Broadway theaters report substantial slowing  in both revenues and attendance since the last report, in part reflecting the  closing of an unusually large number of Broadway shows (13) in January.  In the first half of February, revenues were  down nearly 20 percent from a year ago, while attendance fell by close to 25  percent; this compares with single-digit percentage declines in January and  slight increases in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing markets in the District have  been mixed but generally weak since the last report.  Manhattan's residential rental market  continued to soften in January, with asking rents reported to be down 3 to 9  percent from a year earlier; in addition, a growing number of landlords are  offering one or more months of free rent and are paying any rental fees.  Perhaps as a result, rental vacancy rates,  which had been rising steadily in the second half of 2008, edged down in  January.  A major appraisal firm reports  that Manhattan co-op and condo prices have continued to decline since the  beginning of the year and are down by an estimated 20 to 25 percent from last summer;  the number of transactions thus far in 2009 has been running 60 to 65 percent  lower than a year ago.  A contact reports  seeing very few transactions at the high end of the market in Manhattan, and that  most of them seem to be all-cash deals.   Inventories are rising seasonally from an already-high level and that  backlog is said to be accompanied by a large and growing amount of "shadow"  inventory in new developments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The market for single-family homes in  and around New York City has also weakened, though market conditions were  reported to be more stable in upstate New York.   Contacts in northern New Jersey report little or no discretionary  activity in the resale market--almost all transactions are either foreclosed  properties or distress sales by owners that need to move.  In this environment, market prices are  difficult to gauge, but an industry expert estimates that they are down 15 to 20  percent from the 2007 peak, with steeper declines at the high end.  Separately, a real estate industry contact  notes a rising number of "short sales," for which the mortgage holder agrees to  accept less than the full principal balance upon the sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets in the District  weakened noticeably in January.  An  industry contact notes that New Jersey's office and retail markets have  deteriorated substantially in recent months.   Manhattan's office market has also slackened markedly: the vacancy rate  jumped nearly a full point in January, to 11.3 percent--up from 7.6 percent a  year ago.  Most of the increase was  concentrated in Midtown, particularly in the financial sector.  Asking rents for Class A space fell 2 percent  in January and are down more than 13 percent from a year ago, though an  industry contact notes that this understates the weakness because rents are  increasingly negotiable and landlords are offering more concessions.  There has been virtually no activity in Manhattan's  office sales market.  New York City's  retail rental market has also softened, except at the low end (groceries, drug  stores, etc.).  Demand for retail space  has contracted substantially, particularly in the banking sector--until  recently, banks had been substantial users of space.  Also, the bankruptcy of a major electronics  retail chain, as well as of other retailers, has added a good deal of available  space, and landlords are concerned about the outlook for other retail chains.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions have  deteriorated markedly.  Both  manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms in the District report increasingly  widespread cutbacks in their employment levels in February, and a sizable  proportion expect further retrenchment in the next six months.  Separately, a major New York City employment  agency reports that hiring activity has virtually ground to a halt since the  beginning of the year, during what is usually a busy season.  Large financial firms, as well as legal firms,  have all but stopped hiring; some demand from smaller firms has appeared  sporadically, but they are skittish about filling job openings unless  essential. Weakness in the labor market is said to be reminiscent of 2002, but  more disconcerting, because this time it is seen to be more broad-based and  more structural.
     </p>
     <p>
      In assessing overall business  conditions, manufacturers and other firms report widespread deterioration in  general business conditions in February and flat to declining selling prices.  Moreover, a large majority of respondents do  not anticipate any noticeable improvement in conditions in the next six  months.  New York State reports a sharp  decline in personal income tax revenues in January, compared with a year  earlier, evidently reflecting sharp declines in bonus income in the financial  sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      A trucking-industry contact reports  that shipping volume fell sharply in December, dropping roughly 15 percent from  a year earlier; this followed a modest uptick in November, when the 12-month  decline was under 10 percent.  With the ongoing  weakness in trucking, and given that the first quarter is typically a slow  season anyway, layoffs have been widespread, and a glut of used trucks (especially  tractor-trailers) for sale has developed.   Truckers have seen some relief from diesel prices, which have fallen  even more precipitously than regular gas prices recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small to medium-sized banks report  weakening demand for loans in all categories except residential mortgages, for  which demand was little changed.  The  percentage of bankers reporting weakened demand ranged from 39 percent in the  consumer loan category to 45 percent in the commercial and industrial loan  category.  Bankers reported an increase  in the refinancing rate; 42 percent of bankers reported an increase while 8  percent reported a decrease.  For all  loan categories, respondents indicate tightening credit standards--most notably  in the residential mortgage category.  No  banker reported an easing of credit standards for any loan category.  Respondents note a decrease in the spreads of  loan rates over cost of funds for the residential mortgage category but increased  spreads for the commercial mortgage segment.   Spreads were generally steady for all other loan categories.  Contacts indicate a decrease in the average  deposit rate.  Finally, bankers report  increased delinquency rates across the board, but most notably for consumer  loans.
