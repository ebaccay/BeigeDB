      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       District economic activity was generally described as either mixed or   modestly improving since our last report. While manufacturing remained a bright   spot, the pace of activity reported in our last assessment appears to have eased   somewhat--particularly among firms supplying the housing sector. Port   authorities reported a pick-up in activity, led by recent increases in import   volumes. Bank lending to businesses improved moderately, while home mortgage   lending varied widely around the District. Tourism also strengthened. In   addition, local labor markets posted modest gains, with temp agencies reporting   gains especially from the manufacturing sector. On a weaker note, residential   real estate agents and contacts at other services firms described activity as   mixed. Finally, commercial real estate agents and retailers reported generally   softer market conditions, but both sectors cited at least some pockets of   improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales weakened since our last report.   Several auto dealers reported that light vehicle sales dropped, and a North   Carolina medical devices supplier said payers were trying to negotiate lower   reimbursement rates on durable medical equipment. In addition, a contact at a   large home and garden chain reported that impulse buying fell, and that home   remodeling purchases had scaled back dramatically as consumers "splurged small."   Overall, according to our District survey, big-ticket purchases and shopper   traffic plummeted. Many District retailers indicated that inventories continued   to decline in recent weeks. Merchants increasingly cut jobs, and retail prices   advanced only slightly faster since our last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts and survey respondents at non-retail   services firms reported mixed activity during the past four weeks. For example,   several businesses indicated that their revenues had contracted, while others   reported an uptick, with the caveat that they are not seeing significant   strengthening in their markets. Several contacts at professional, scientific,   and technical firms said their businesses experienced increased demand for   services since our last report, while a financial advisor at an investment   services firm said conditions were "stable." Several healthcare-related   businesses cited little change in demand in recent weeks, but a West Virginia   nursing home administrator said the economy and healthcare reform put downward   pressure on his business. Many respondents to our service sector survey reported   that price increases slowed at services firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing continued to expand   in June and early July, albeit at a slower pace than a few months ago. Most of   our District survey respondents reported that growth in their shipments and new   orders had moderated, while several contacts noted that their employment edged   higher. A parts supplier reported a significant increase in demand from auto   manufacturers, with business being well ahead of expectations. In addition, a   tire producer informed us that his customers had depleted their inventories,   which caused him to expect an increase in orders soon. Moreover, a contact at a   textile plant commented that his company had built inventory in anticipation of   continued price increases for synthetic fibers. He noted, however, that his   customers continued to maintain low inventory levels, with current sales higher   than replenishment rates. In contrast, a furniture manufacturer noted that his   company had reduced its workforce by half due to weak conditions in the housing   market. Similarly, a manufacturer of exterior doors for residential housing   indicated that the previous uptick in demand for building products had now   vanished.
      </p>
      <p>
       Port activity in the District picked up since our last report. One contact   stated that total shipping volume at his port was back to pre-recession levels.   While exports had been improving over much of this year, he noted that imports   were now increasing as well. A contact that handles a variety of roll-on cargo   stated that about two-thirds of the recent gains in port activity were being   driven by imports. At least some of the import gains were attributed to   inventory restocking. Several port officials noted that shipping lines were   attempting to raise rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Banking activity over the last six to eight weeks   improved modestly, but gains were uneven. For example, several bankers noted an   increase in commercial lending, although one lender stated that commercial   lending had weakened. Contacts noted that increased lending went to support   high-tech and export activity, as well as auto dealer inventory. An increase in   merger and acquisition activity was also noted by several sources. One banker   reported a marginal improvement in small business lending, while an analyst for   a large bank reported a retrenchment in consumer borrowing. A small community   banker stated that the bank's own auto loans had edged down as other banks   returned to the market, increasing loan competition. Reports on home mortgage   lending varied, with some bankers reporting improvements and others still   experiencing declines. A loan officer at a community bank stated that   refinancing was a significant portion of his mortgage lending activity in recent   weeks. Most contacts stated that credit quality was slowly improving from a weak   base, although one source noted that delinquencies on both residential and   commercial loans were still "off the charts."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from residential Realtors varied   across the Fifth District. Several contacts reported that home sales slowed   since the expiration of the federal government's tax credit program. However,   other contacts indicated that sales in the upper-middle price bracket were still   moving, at least in some areas of the District, while one agent noted that   single-family homes in suburban neighborhoods were experiencing the most   activity. Another agent reported that houses priced below $150K remained the   best sellers, due to more foreclosure-related and short sales. A Realtor in   Richmond reported that the metropolitan market in recent weeks did not meet the   company's expectations in July. An agent for a major realty chain noted that the   average number of days on the market for most homes remained high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets continued to weaken since our last report,   with at least one contact not expecting improvements until well into the future.   According to one contact in North Carolina, vacancy rates in most metro areas   remained relatively high and were still rising in some areas. Vacancy rates were   particularly high in the retail sector in both Richmond and Baltimore, according   to several agents. Retail and office leasing activity was reported to be   improving in Columbia, S.C., as well as in parts of North Carolina. Commercial   rental rates in parts of North Carolina were being driven down by property   owners' fears that things could get worse, and an agent stated that retail   rental rates remained negotiable in Richmond. One contact stated that new   construction financing was "not going at all."
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Tourist activity increased since our last report.   Along the coast, contacts reported that bookings over the July 4th holiday   weekend were much stronger than a year ago. A hotelier from Virginia Beach noted   that his hotel was filled to capacity, even though room rates had jumped   dramatically. A contact in Myrtle Beach said that visitation was up 10 to 12   percent in recent weeks compared to a year ago, but consumer spending was still   below pre-recession levels. He attributed some of the increase in visits and   spending to tourists changing vacation plans from the Gulf to the eastern   seaboard. Moreover, an analyst from the Outer Banks of North Carolina indicated   that restaurants were full and sales at gift shops were flourishing. Managers at   mountain resorts reported that holiday reservations were the best in years and   that time shares were rented for most of the summer. They noted, however, that   although tourists were spending slightly less on food, they were spending   considerably more on recreational activities and merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Markets
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor market activity picked up slightly in   recent weeks, according to most contacts. Several firms reported adding jobs for   at least a third straight month. A services firm increased its hiring due to   rising demand, but several retailers reported job cuts. Temporary employment   agents reported slow, but steady increases in hiring by small or mid-sized   businesses--especially in manufacturing. For example, a contact at an automotive   plant told us that temporary employment workers had been hired to help with the   increase in production. One temp agent noted an increase in the number of   employees being hired on a permanent basis by his clients. Increased demand for   temporary workers was reported for a diverse set of industries, including   warehouse and distribution centers, manufacturing plants, and pharmaceutical   firms. Most respondents to our manufacturing and service sector surveys   indicated that wages were little changed since our last report.
