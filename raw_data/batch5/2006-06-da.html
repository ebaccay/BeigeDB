      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh District economic activity continued to expand quite strongly from 
  mid-April to early June. Energy activity is still very robust, and both the 
  manufacturing and service sectors report continued strong activity. Construction 
  and real estate activity remained brisk, but there was a noticeable dip in the 
  market for lower priced homes, particularly in Dallas and Fort Worth. Retail 
  sales growth weakened slightly. Financial service contacts continue to report 
  favorable conditions. Spring rains have improved agricultural conditions, but 
  parts of the District remain very dry, and drought has damaged some production. 
  Rising costs pushed up selling prices for many industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices are higher for a number of inputs, including crude oil, fuel, chemicals, 
  paper, packaging, metals and transportation. Some retailers and most manufacturers 
  said they had passed cost increases through to higher selling prices. Service 
  sector firms also report they are charging higher prices. There were a few reports 
  of price declines, most notably for natural gas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are higher for most construction-related manufactured products, but 
  prices fell for a few products used in homebuilding. Builders say rising construction 
  costs are a growing concern because stiff competition is making it difficult 
  to increase prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crude oil prices hovered around $70 per barrel during the period boosted by 
  concerns that political tension and terrorism could lead to supply disruptions. 
  The recovery of refinery capacity along the Gulf Coast helped push oil demand 
  back up to normal ranges, but consumption remains on the low side of the 5-year 
  average, and inventories of crude are well above historical levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gasoline prices in the District increased at the pump throughout most of the 
  period, rising to near $3 per gallon in mid-May. Inventories of reformulated 
  gas fell to very low levels as the industry changed to ethanol-based oxygenates. 
  The change appears to be nearly complete, but ethanol is in short supply and 
  a series of refinery outages has kept markets nervous.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mild weather reduced demand for natural gas, and inventories increased to 
  55 percent above normal for this time of year. Prices fell from $8 to $6 per 
  million Btu at Henry Hub. Prices would have fallen further if not for rising 
  crude prices and the coming hurricane season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices are higher for most chemicals. After falling through March and April, 
  major plant outages pushed up ethylene prices in May. Higher ethylene prices, 
  low inventories and a boost in demand pushed up polyethylene prices. Propylene, 
  which can be used the production of gasoline, rose along with prices at the 
  pump. Polypropylene prices were also up. Polyvinyl chloride prices were lower, 
  which contacts attributed to weaker sales to homebuilders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The labor market continues to tighten, with reports of increased hiring in manufacturing 
  and services. Firms are reporting more difficulty finding workers, and more 
  contacts say that it is necessary to increase wages to obtain or retain employees. 
  Shortages are mostly for skilled positions, such as for truckers, lawyers, accountants, 
  financial analysts, high tech engineers and workers to supply the energy industry--especially 
  welders and engineers. Temporary service firms say it is harder to find qualified 
  workers, particularly since their customers are resisting wage increases. There 
  has been an increase in the number of direct hires and temp-to-perm hires, which 
  they say reflects the confidence their clients have in the growth of the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remains strong. Demand continued to be robust for most 
  construction-related products, including metals, cement, stone, clay, brick 
  and glass. The majority of producers said demand was still strong from residential 
  homebuilders, but producers of lumber noted some weakening. Still demand remains 
  heavy to supply lumber to commercial builders.
     </p>
     <p>
      The paper industry reported stronger demand for products, particularly to 
  supply schools and hospitals. Sales of food and apparel products were unchanged. 
  The high-tech industry reported continued good growth. Semiconductor producers 
  said demand was up, and one firm reports that their bookings are stronger than 
  revenue. Most respondents said inventories are at desired levels, and prices 
  are firming.
     </p>
     <p>
      Refinery capacity utilization along the Gulf Coast returned to 90 percent 
  for the first time since the hurricanes, primarily due to the return of three 
  large refineries (two in New Orleans and one in Houston). The return from spring 
  maintenance continued to be slower than expected. The chemical industry also 
  continues to recover from the hurricanes. Contacts say demand for plastics is 
  probably being helped by some precautionary inventory building before the hurricane 
  season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Temporary staffing firms report steady activity, up significantly from a year 
  ago. Law firms say demand for their services has been steady, and accounting 
  firms say activity levels are typical for this time of year. The transportation 
  industry continued to report strong demand. Rail volume has been very strong, 
  boosted by shipments of coal, coke and metals. Activity in the trucking and 
  airline industries also remains strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall retail sales growth weakened slightly since the last Beige Book. Reports 
  from retailers were very mixed, with some reporting very good or extraordinarily 
  strong sales, while others reporting that sales were soft or disappointing. 
  Sales continue to be weakest at stores selling to lower-income customers, who 
  are spending a larger share of their disposable income on gasoline and energy 
  utilities. Consumers appeared to be changing their buying habits to accommodate 
  rising prices and higher gasoline costs. Retailers say customers are making 
  less frequent visits to the store and switching to stores that are closer to 
  home. Auto sales increased seasonally in most markets, although sales in Dallas 
  were unchanged. Some dealers report sizable excess inventory because demand 
  was less than anticipated during the winter months. Contacts expect the recent 
  increase in rebates and other incentives to boost sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The housing market softened slightly following very strong growth over the past 
  year. Sales of existing homes are still brisk in Austin, El Paso, Houston and 
  San Antonio, but sales weakened in Dallas and Fort Worth. Demand for lower priced 
  homes has dipped noticeably in several markets, which contacts attribute to 
  higher interest rates, rising energy costs and tighter lending standards. Overall, 
  industry leaders say residential real estate activity is solid at very high 
  levels, but they are quite nervous about the market being affected by press 
  reports of a possible fall off in housing prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for apartments remains strong, and occupancies are increasing in most 
  markets, but rents are not firming as expected. A notable exception is in Houston 
  where hurricane evacuees continue to stimulate the market, particularly for 
  Class B and C properties. There is growing concern about overbuilding of condominiums 
  and town homes in Dallas, and contacts fear that it will end badly. Demand for 
  office space continues to edge up at a steady pace, with rents firming. Contacts 
  say retail markets remain healthy. Demand for industrial properties is gradually 
  improving.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial loan demand remains steady, according to lenders who say there continues 
  to be competitive pressures on pricing. Commercial lenders are very optimistic 
  about the future and say loan quality is still very good. Respondents lending 
  to consumers say borrowing remains steady, and credit quality is good.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Texas rig count continues to rise rapidly, with most of the drilling on 
  land and directed toward natural gas. Two rigs were added in the Gulf of Mexico 
  over the past month, but rigs continue to leave the Gulf because drilling in 
  other locations is more profitable and the approaching hurricane season has 
  pushed up insurance premiums.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent weakness in natural gas prices has not curtailed exploration according 
  to contacts. Some drilling for natural gas could become unprofitable if current 
  prices persist or weaken further, but the futures market shows stronger prices 
  by late fall. The current surplus of natural gas in storage could disappear 
  quickly with a hot summer or a hurricane-related disruption of supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The industry's expansion is still being constrained, mostly by shortages of 
  labor. Strong demand and rising prices for inputs, including commodities and 
  labor, are pushing up prices of oilfield services.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Spring rains have improved planting, range and pasture conditions in some parts 
  of the District. Other areas remain very dry, however, and herd reduction continues. 
  Drought damaged the winter wheat crop, and production was down 65 percent from 
  last year. Cotton and grain sorghum crops in South Texas have also been damaged, 
  and producers are collecting insurance on these crops.
