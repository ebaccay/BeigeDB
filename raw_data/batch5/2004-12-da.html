      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
      <p>
       Eleventh District economic activity appears to have accelerated slightly from 

  mid-October to mid-November. Manufacturing and business service activity continued 

  to slowly strengthen. Retail sales and construction were mixed. Financial institutions 

  report continued improvement in conditions. Energy activity is up. Agricultural 

  conditions remain mostly favorable. Many respondents noted relief that the election 

  was over, explaining that it wasn't because one candidate won over another as 

  much as the elimination of uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There were many reports of higher prices but also reports of downward price 

  pressures. Energy prices remain relatively high after spiking and then declining 

  slightly. Higher costs for energy and other inputs remain a concern for most 

  respondents. Some say they are increasing selling prices enough to make up for 

  the cost increases. Others say competitive pressures, both domestic and international, 

  are making that difficult. Contacts say import competition, particularly from 

  China, is keeping downward price pressure on some manufactured products, such 

  as apparel and fabricated metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       After surging to near $56 per barrel on the spot market, crude prices dropped 

  to slightly below those reported in the last Beige Book. Crude inventories are 

  now near the five-year average level for November, helped by a surge of imports 

  that had been delayed by Gulf Coast hurricanes. Private forecasts of a cold 

  winter and spiking heating oil prices pushed spot natural gas prices to near 

  $8 per million Btu in early November, but prices fell to near $7 per million 

  Btu as natural gas storage rose to record levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the possibility of stronger than normal seasonal demand for heating oil, 

  contacts report concerns about heating oil production for the coming winter. 

  Refiners have been in a significant turnaround period, and operating rates in 

  October were below normal even for the fall maintenance season. Heating oil 

  inventories have fallen to levels near the bottom of the five-year range. Heating 

  oil prices have been whipsawed by uncertainty about the ability to refill inventories 

  before winter arrives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Selling prices are up for most chemical products. Producers say heavy demand 

  is helping them pass along significant cost increases, primarily from energy, 

  but also from shipping and other material inputs. Metals producers say selling 

  prices are up slightly because of steep cost increases for aluminum, scrap metal, 

  nickel and alloy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some producers express concerns about the effects of a weaker dollar, noting 

  that increased costs for imported materials are pushing up prices for final 

  products. Other contacts say they are not affected by changes in the value of 

  the dollar because they do much of their transactions in dollars or in currencies 

  that are pegged to the dollar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers anticipate the January 2005 elimination of import quotas for textiles 

  to lower imported textile prices by as much as 13 percent to 18 percent. This 

  reduction is expected to be reflected in prices for spring merchandise. Retailers 

  do not expect to reduce selling prices. They say lower costs will translate 

  into "more normal" profits and an improved quality of merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Market
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There are few reports of hiring or wage increases, although higher benefit costs, 

  particularly for health care, remain a pervasive concern. Temporary service 

  firms say they hope to push through higher fees to offset an increase in the 

  Texas state unemployment insurance tax that they have been told is likely in 

  January 2005.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity increased for most products. Demand was up for fabricated 

  metals, high-tech, food and energy-related products. Sales remained strong for 

  construction-related products, such as lumber, clay, cement, brick and glass, 

  but contacts are cautious about slowing demand for housing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of primary metals declined slightly over the past couple of months, leading 

  to a few shift reductions but no major layoffs. While contacts noted some continued 

  effect from the hurricanes, they say there was also increased competition from 

  Chinese imports. Sales of paper products have been lower than expected for this 

  time of year, which contacts attribute to loss of market share to overseas producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for food products increased some over the past month. Apparel producers 

  say demand has been unchanged over the past month but is up from three months 

  ago. Apparel manufacturers are very concerned about China's import quota ending 

  next year.
      </p>
      <p>
       High-tech manufacturers report that production and orders continue to grow 

  at a good pace. Contacts say retailers have built inventories of IT products 

  in expectations of healthy Christmas spending and there may be some shortages 

  if sales are very strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand was up for energy-related manufacturers, including producers of oilfield 

  hardware, tools and well-bore equipment, who reported higher prices, sales and 

  margins. Demand for chemicals is extremely strong, particularly for products 

  such as ethylene, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, chlorine, 

  and caustic soda. Export demand for petrochemicals was very strong, based on 

  favorable natural-gas-to-oil-price ratio, a weaker dollar, and significant operating 

  problems in Europe and Venezuela. Refiners' margins have steadily improved in 

  recent weeks, coming back from a significant decline in margins in late summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for temporary staffing firms picked up in most parts of the district. 

  Demand strengthened for light industrial manufacturing, administrative and clerical 

  work, according to contacts, but demand remained weak in the financial services 

  sector. There were reports of temporary workers being made permanent, which 

  contacts said was unusual for this time of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for legal services has been strong in the past month, and contacts say 

  activity is up compared with a year ago. Accounting firms report that demand 

  remains very strong and increasing, mostly due to the increased needs of the 

  Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Accounting firms report substantial hiring, particularly 

  for auditors and risk management professionals. Salaries for these types of 

  professionals have increased by as much as 7 percent to 8 percent this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       High fuel costs continue to plague transportation service firms. Railroads 

  report high loads, particularly to carry metallic ores, metals, wood, building 

  products and domestic consumer goods. The airline industry continues to suffer 

  from too much capacity and no pricing power, forcing them to absorb all cost 

  pressures. Contacts say that restructuring is being impaired by bankrupt carriers 

  that continue to operate below total costs, pulling down healthier carriers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Sales growth increased for retailers selling to upper-and middle-income consumers, 

  with particularly strong sales of high-end products, such as HDTVs and jewelry. 

  Respondents attributed the increase in sales to lower gasoline prices, greater 

  job security and reduced geopolitical concerns. Sales growth was "disappointing" 

  for retailers selling to the lower-income consumers. Contacts say that these 

  consumers are still feeling the strain of high gasoline prices and health care 

  costs. Automobile sales remain soft, down slightly from year ago levels, with 

  inventories higher than desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Housing sales and prices softened slightly over the past six weeks. Existing 

  home sales tapered off, and homebuilders say traffic has slowed and they are 

  offering more concessions. Many homebuilders report that sales are still above 

  last year's levels, but inventories continue to rise. Housing industry contacts 

  are optimistic for 2005, but say a stronger rate of job growth is needed to 

  meet sales expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continued construction of new units is weighing down apartment markets 

  in Dallas and Houston. Occupancy levels in Austin and San Antonio have improved, 

  but contacts remain cautious about the outlook because of the amount of construction 

  proposed and underway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Office markets improved over the past six weeks. Respondents say leasing activity 

  continued to pick up slowly. Existing tenants are expanding lease space, as 

  companies and take advantage of low rental rates. Tremendous capital market 

  activity continues. Office construction remains very low, with most being build-to-suit 

  or government funded.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Deposit growth was flat to up. Commercial and industrial lending activity appears 

  to be picking up, but contacts report that lingering uncertainty about the economy 

  is still slowing some investment. Some contacts expressed concerns that higher 

  interest rates are slowing lending, particularly to small business. Mortgage 

  lending was flat to down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       U.S. crude oil demand has been near or slightly below what is expected for this 

  time of year. The domestic rig count increased over the past six weeks, with 

  most of the gains directed to oil. More land rigs are under construction, and 

  some are being upgraded to support faster and deeper drilling. International 

  drilling also rose in November, particularly in the North Sea. (Data show that 

  international activity fell sharply in October, but contacts believe it was 

  a statistical aberration because an unusual number of rigs were in transit instead 

  of working.) Conditions in the oil field services and machinery sectors are 

  improving, and most segments of the industry are busy and enjoying higher prices, 

  growing backlogs of work and equipment orders, and expectations that their markets 

  will remain strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts report capacity constraints in some areas, but there appears to be 

  potential for continued expansion in oilfield equipment manufacturing, oilfield 

  construction and shallow offshore drilling. There have been some reports of 

  short supplies of steel products in the oil patch--including drill pipe, downhole 

  tubing, and anything made of stainless steel. Most respondents noted capacity 

  constraints in labor-intensive oilfield services where people have to be especially 

  well trained and qualified--such as fracturing, pressure pumping or tubular 

  makeup. In addition, rental rates have improved for rigs capable of drilling 

  deep water because many rigs were moved to other areas of the world that promised 

  greater returns. The oilfield services that could not leave with the rigs--such 

  as downhole fluids, supply boats, and helicopter services--are in excess supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Rain improved soil moisture conditions but halted planting and harvest in some 

  areas. Supplemental feeding of livestock was active in the wet parts of the 

  district. Estimates of Texas cotton production were revised up to 7.7 million 

  bales, this will be an increase of 78 percent from 2003 and 27 percent from 

  the record 1949 harvest. Strong U.S. production has pushed down prices for cotton, 

  soybeans and corn. Contacts say demand is unchanged for most crops, but they 

  hope that the weaker U.S. dollar may boost exports. Strong demand for calves 

  and feeder cattle continue to boost cattle prices.
