      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to edge up during the   reporting period of mid-October through mid-November. Despite rising prices for   selected commodities, price increases for final goods and services remained   quite limited, and upward wage pressures were largely absent. Sales of retail   items and services rose a bit further. Manufacturing activity in the District   continued to expand on net. Sales of agricultural products were robust, and   demand strengthened for providers of energy resources. Housing demand stayed   subdued, and demand for commercial real estate remained weak but showed signs of   life in a few areas. Financial institutions reported that lending activity was   largely unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation was limited for most   items. Contacts noted price increases for an assortment of raw materials, such   as oil, wheat, and aluminum, and for selected products sourced from China, such   as apparel. However, final prices for most retail items and service categories   continued to be restrained by weak demand and widespread competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were virtually nonexistent, held down by minimal demand   for new employees and high unemployment in most parts of the District. However,   contacts continued to point to significant increases in employee benefit costs,   particularly for health care. Hiring plans for permanent employees remained   quite limited in most sectors, although a few reports pointed to expectations   for a larger surge of temporary holiday hires than in the past two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rose further on   balance but remained lackluster overall. Modest improvements in sales were   reported for traditional department stores as well as discount chains, with the   strongest gains again noted for moderately priced home and garden products.   Sales were characterized as flat to down for grocers and for retailers of   furniture and major appliances. Contacts generally anticipate that holiday   season retail sales will exceed their levels from last year, with expected   nominal gains ranging from 2 to 3 percent up to 5 to 7 percent. Reports on   holiday inventories were mixed, with some contacts reporting continued lean   inventories and others noting slightly elevated levels. New domestic and   imported automobile sales improved further, spurred largely by rising demand for   light trucks and vans. Sales of used vehicles were strong, but contacts noted   that supply remained tight. Retail contacts reported that capital spending was   quite limited and focused largely on labor-saving technologies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for services firmed further. Sales expanded for providers of   technology services, prompted in part by a focus on efficiency-enhancing   software investments in most sectors of the economy. Demand for professional   services, such as legal and accounting, held largely stable. Providers of energy   services reported further demand growth from households and businesses. Travel   activity improved further in much of the District, spurred by growth in business   travel as well as tourism. Visitor volumes and hotel occupancy rates showed   solid gains in Hawaii but were flat to down in San Diego.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity posted   further gains during the reporting period of mid-October through mid-November.   For makers of commercial aircraft and parts, growth in new orders for some   aircraft combined with an extensive backlog to keep production rates at or near   capacity. Demand grew further for manufacturers of semiconductors and other   technology products, with reports highlighting rising sales, high levels of   capacity utilization, and plans for expanded capital spending by some companies   in the near term. Demand continued to tick up for metal fabricators, although   production remained well below normal. Despite modest improvements in demand,   elevated inventories caused petroleum refiners to further reduce their   production activity. Sales remained anemic for manufacturers of wood   products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand was   robust for agricultural producers and improved on net for natural resources used   for energy production. Final sales and orders rose for assorted crops and   livestock products, and, other than price increases for livestock feed, reports   indicated little change in input costs. Reductions in overseas yields due to   earlier unfavorable weather conditions combined with the lower value of the U.S.   dollar to boost sales for domestic producers of corn, wheat, and other food   grains. Oil extraction activity rose somewhat, as robust demand growth from   emerging markets along with modest improvements in domestic demand pushed up the   price of oil. Extraction activity for natural gas was largely steady despite an   ongoing decline in its price.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in residential and   nonresidential real estate markets generally remained unchanged at very low   levels. The pace of home sales was mixed across areas of the District but   appeared stable to down slightly on balance, despite improved affordability   arising from low mortgage rates and past price declines. New home construction   remained at exceptionally low levels, as sluggish sales and continued high rates   of foreclosure caused the availability of new and existing homes to remain   elevated. Demand remained weak overall in commercial real estate markets, and   tenants in some areas continued to receive rent reductions and other   concessions. However, further increases in leasing activity were noted for some   major markets in the District, such as for technology companies in San   Francisco, along with rising market values and improved availability of   financing for investment transactions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely unchanged on balance compared with the previous   reporting period. Demand for commercial and industrial loans inched up in some   areas but remained restrained by businesses' cautious approach to capital   spending. On the consumer side, loan demand appeared to weaken slightly, which   contacts attributed in part to households' desire to deleverage. Lending   standards remained relatively restrictive for business and consumer lending, and   a few contacts pointed to ongoing struggles with credit quality for some   banks.
