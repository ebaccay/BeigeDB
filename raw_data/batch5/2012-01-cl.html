      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy in the Fourth District grew at a slow pace during the past six   weeks. Manufacturers reported that new orders and production were stable.   Single-family home construction improved slightly, while nonresidential builders   saw a drop-off in inquiries and weak backlogs. November retail and motor vehicle   sales were little changed from the prior month. Activity in shale gas drilling   and production expanded. Freight transport volume slowed along seasonal trends.   The demand for credit by businesses and households was characterized as either   steady or increasing slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Labor market reports indicated that hiring remains at a low level, while   recruiting high-skilled workers was difficult. Staffing-firm representatives saw   growth in the number of new job openings, with vacancies concentrated in   healthcare and energy. Wage pressures were largely contained. Other than a boost   in steel prices, upward pressure on raw material prices has abated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New orders and production at District   factories were mainly stable during the past six weeks. Any declines were   attributed to seasonal factors or lessening demand from European and Chinese   customers. Compared to year-ago levels, the majority of our contacts noted a   moderate improvement in output. However, they are cautious in their outlook and   expect little change in demand during the upcoming months. Most steel producers   and service centers reported that shipping volume was steady along seasonal   trends, although two of our contacts noted an unexpected pickup for this time of   year. Demand is being driven by autos, energy, and heavy equipment industries.   Steel representatives are hopeful about the first quarter of 2012, and most   expect to see at least modest growth. District auto production showed a   substantial decline during November on a month-over-month basis, more so for   foreign nameplates. Most of the decline was attributed to supply chain issues.   Year-over-year, domestic auto producers' output rose significantly, while their   foreign counterparts posted moderate declines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capacity utilization was below normal at most factories, while steel   producers saw their utilization rates at or near normal levels. Inventories were   in line with sales for the majority of our contacts. Manufacturers told us that   their capital outlays have reached targeted levels for the year. Only a few   respondents indicated that they expect to significantly raise their capital   budgets for 2012. Other than steel, raw material prices were steady during the   past few weeks. We heard several reports about steel producers raising their   prices and the possibility of a second round of increases early in 2012. New   hiring remained at a low level. Those adding to payrolls found it difficult to   recruit professional and high-skilled production workers. Wage pressures are   contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Single-family home construction was   described as better during the past couple of months, with sales contracts   distributed across all price-point categories. Builders were slightly more   optimistic in their outlook, but they are not expecting an industry turnaround   in the near term. We heard a report that homebuilders' inventories are on a   decline in some parts of the District, which should help boost new-home   construction during 2012. Not much change was seen in the list prices of new   homes, though two of our contacts noted a greater use of discounting. A few   subcontractors attempted to raise billing rates, but they were unsuccessful.   Employment and wages were stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in nonresidential construction for small to medium-size builders was   steady, although the number of inquiries has fallen off during the past few   weeks. The biggest challenges facing nonresidential contractors continue to be   financing projects and adding to backlog. Construction contracts were primarily   with manufacturers and health-care providers. Builders are uncertain about   future prospects. One contractor noted that he does not expect a major pick-up   through at least the first half of 2012. On balance, building material prices   were stable. The number of reports about sub contractors going out of businesses   rose, while general contracting payrolls showed a slight decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers reported that November sales   were stable or slightly higher relative to October sales. According to a few of   our contacts, a milder than expected autumn was holding back purchases of cold   weather-related items, while purchases of electronics and home furnishings were   better than expected. On a year-over-year basis, results were mixed. Sales for   the first quarter of 2012 are generally expected to improve over prior-year   levels, mainly in the low- to mid-single digits. Some retailers expressed   caution about 2012 given the fragility of household balance sheets. Upward   pressure on supplier costs has abated during the past six weeks. Inventories   were characterized as good except for apparel items, which are higher than   desired. Capital budgets were on plan. Most of our contacts said that outlays   during 2012 will not change appreciably from this year's levels and that outlays   will be used mainly for technology enhancements and remodeling. Other than   seasonal hiring, there was little change in employment at existing stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers reported that new-vehicle sales during November remained strong.   On a year-over-year basis, sales volume was largely higher. Dealers saw robust   demand for all vehicle types. A few dealers noted that their inventories are now   adequate. Others said that inventories are low, which they attributed to brisk   sales. The outlook for 2012 is somewhat tentative, mainly because of   uncertainty. Purchases of used vehicles have fallen off slightly, due in part to   a supply shortage. We heard reports about some easing of credit restrictions,   while interest rates were very competitive. Dealers are investing in   manufacturer-mandated facility upgrades and imaging programs. The few dealers   looking to hire reported that it is difficult to find qualified candidates,   especially sales representatives and service technicians.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for business loans was characterized as   either stable or increasing. Requests are being driven by commercial real   estate, notably multifamily housing, and healthcare. On the consumer side, our   contacts described installment loan activity as flat or up a bit. Auto lending   (direct and indirect) and home equity lines of credit continued to show   strength. Bankers said that they have not seen a bump up in the use of credit   cards during the holiday shopping season. Interest rates for business and   consumer credit were very competitive. Activity in the residential mortgage   market has been solid in the fourth quarter, driven by low interest rates. Most   applicants are looking to refinance. No changes were made to loan application   standards. Delinquencies were steady or declined across most loan categories;   any stress was found in real estate portfolios and credit cards. Overall core   deposits grew, although a few bankers commented that growth is being driven by   business customers. Payrolls were stable, with little hiring expected in the   near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Conventional oil and natural gas production was   mainly steady during the past few weeks, with little change expected in the   upcoming months. Our contacts were uncertain about future gas drilling due to   eroding natural gas prices. Well-head prices for oil were flat, but remained   elevated. Activity in shale-gas extraction expanded. Coal output was stable,   though it may decline during 2012 due to an easing in demand for thermal and   metallurgical coals from European customers and domestic power producers. The   latter was attributed to abundant supplies of low-priced natural gas and   regulatory compliance issues for coal-fired generators. Spot prices for several   types of coal have fallen off. Capital outlays are on target, with moderate   increases projected by oil and gas companies in the upcoming months. The cost of   production equipment and materials was generally flat during the past six weeks.   Energy payrolls held steady. A few small oil and gas producers are beginning to   experience wage pressures brought on by competition from large firms engaged in   shale gas exploration and production.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Freight transport volume has slowed during   the past few weeks, following seasonal trends. Strong demand was still seen from   the energy and manufacturing sectors. Our contacts expect volume to grow at a   slow, steady pace during 2012, with predictions in the mid-single digits. We   heard numerous reports of rising prices for parts, especially tires, and of some   volatility in fuel prices. Much of the cost increase was recovered via fuel   surcharges and rate adjustments when contracts came due. Capital outlays were on   plan for 2011. Most of our contacts expect to increase their capital budgets   during 2012 for fleet expansion and to replace aging equipment. Operators   reported hiring for driver replacement or adding capacity, although recruiting   qualified drivers is difficult. Wage pressures exist due to a tightening of the   driver pool.
