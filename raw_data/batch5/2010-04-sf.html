      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to improve modestly   during the reporting period of late February into early April. Upward price   pressures were quite limited, and upward wage pressures were largely absent.   Sales of retail items and services remained somewhat sluggish, but both   continued to show signs of improved demand. District manufacturing activity   firmed a bit further, with improvement noted even in the sectors that have been   among the most troubled, such as metal fabrication and wood products. Sales   continued to expand for agricultural products, while demand for energy resources   was mixed. Housing demand appeared to be little changed from the previous   period, but conditions in commercial real estate eroded a bit further on net.   Contacts from financial institutions reported largely stable lending activity   and further declines in credit quality.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Upward price pressures were limited on   net during the reporting period. The prices of oil and selected industrial   commodities such as steel rose. Contacts also reported price increases for   transportation services, notably for transpacific shipping. More generally,   however, contacts in various sectors noted that final prices for a wide variety   of retail items and services continued to be held down by weak demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures remained largely nonexistent, although businesses   continued to report significant increases in the costs of employee benefits,   such as health insurance and pensions. High levels of unemployment throughout   the District kept wage pressures to a minimum, and contacts noted continuing   work furloughs and hiring freezes in some sectors. Rising reliance on temporary   workers in some sectors put additional downward pressure on wages for permanent   employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of retail items continued   to improve but remained somewhat sluggish on net. Discount chains and   traditional department stores reported further sales gains, and although   consumers continued to focus their purchases on necessities, a few contacts   pointed to increases in discretionary spending. Retailers of furniture,   appliances, and electronic items noted improved sales. Demand remained strong   for grocers, although contacts reported disruptions in supplies of fresh produce   caused by the earthquake in Chile. Sales of new automobiles firmed somewhat as   dealers stepped up their promotional activities. Sales of used automobiles rose   strongly, but contacts noted that limited supply and rising prices may restrain   sales going forward. Contacts in general expect consumer spending to strengthen   further in the second quarter of 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for services remained lackluster overall but showed further signs of   improvement on balance. Contacts in the restaurant and food services industry   noted modest increases in demand. For providers of professional and media   services, sales were largely stable at low levels, although they rose slightly   for some categories. Energy utilities reported increased demand from households   and from businesses in selected industries, notably large retail establishments   and firms in the technology, health services, and lodging sectors. Conditions   improved a bit further in the tourism and leisure sector: contacts in the   Southern California and Seattle markets noted recent increases in hotel   occupancy rates, while contacts in Hawaii and Las Vegas saw additional increases   in visitor volumes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued   to improve during the reporting period of late February into early April. Demand   strengthened further for manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology   products, with reports pointing to rising sales and high levels of capacity   utilization. New orders remained limited for makers of commercial aircraft and   parts, but existing order backlogs generally held production rates at or near   capacity. Demand improved modestly for struggling companies in the metal   fabrication and wood products sectors, although capacity utilization remained at   extremely low levels. Activity at petroleum refineries remained well below the   five-year average levels, as producers worked down excess inventories arising   from weak demand for gasoline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand   remained strong for agricultural producers but was mixed for providers of   natural resources used for energy production. Sales rose further for assorted   crops and livestock products. Agricultural contacts indicated no changes in the   availability of key inputs, and favorable weather in many parts of the District   continued to enhance production conditions for a range of agricultural products.   Oil extraction activity remained at relatively low levels but rose somewhat   during the reporting period in response to modest increases in global demand,   while demand for natural gas fell as a result of warmer weather but otherwise   showed scattered signs of firming.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing demand in the   District appeared to be largely stable on net, while demand for commercial real   estate continued to slide. The pace of home sales remained mixed across areas   but appeared largely stable overall, while home prices edged up further in some   parts of the District. However, contacts noted that continued limitations on the   availability of nonconforming "jumbo" loans have restrained sales of   higher-priced homes in some areas. Conditions deteriorated further in commercial   real estate markets, as vacancy rates for office and industrial space rose in   many parts of the District. However, one contact reported continued improvements   in leasing activity for some market segments in parts of the District, along   with increased availability of financing for commercial real estate   transactions. Regarding near-term expectations, contacts in general anticipate   that demand for housing in the District will improve modestly in the second   quarter of 2010, while a majority expects no improvement in demand for   commercial real estate in the second quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking contacts reported   that loan demand was largely stable or up slightly compared with previous   reporting periods. Consumer loan demand remained weak overall, and commercial   and industrial loan volumes continued to be restrained by businesses' cautious   attitudes towards capital spending. However, scattered reports indicated a small   pickup in commercial and industrial loan demand stemming from selected   businesses that are planning to replace worn equipment and rebuild inventories.   Lending standards continued to be relatively restrictive for consumer and   business lending, and banks reported additional loan losses. Further modest   gains in levels of venture capital funding were noted.
