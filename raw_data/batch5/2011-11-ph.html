      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Business activity in the Third District has returned to a path of slow   overall growth since the previous Beige Book. Following unusual weather   disruptions from an earthquake, a hurricane, and a tropical storm during late   summer, the region was visited again â€“ this time by a rare early season   snowstorm. The weekend storm caused widespread electric utility outages and   disrupted business, but the cold weather ultimately triggered shoppers' interest   for the winter season. Since the last Beige Book, manufacturing activity has   grown modestly, but steadily. Retailers reported renewed growth in   year-over-year sales. Motor vehicle dealers experienced strong year-over-year   sales growth; however, Thailand's recent widespread flooding has caused another   supply disruption of auto parts. Third District banks have reported slight   growth in loan volume outstanding since the last Beige Book. On balance, new   home sales continued below year-ago levels, while construction activity   strengthened since the last Beige Book. Reports from commercial real estate   contacts were more mixed by sector and location, but slightly positive overall.   Service-sector firms reported generally modest growth. Price pressures remained   contained for most sectors but continued to strain profit margins in all but a   few sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most Third District business contacts had already lowered their expectations   over the past few months--projecting slow to flat growth through year-end.   Ongoing uncertainty since the previous Beige Book has not significantly altered   their outlook. Manufacturers still expect a modest rise in shipments and orders   during the next six months. Retailers are hopeful for stronger sales, and auto   dealers are uncertain; both have lean inventory plans. Most banking and   residential real estate contacts had lowered their expectations before the last   Beige Book. Commercial real estate contacts and service-sector firms continue to   plan for slow growth; however, uncertainty has increased.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Since the last Beige Book, Third District   manufacturers have reported modest increases in new orders and shipments.   However, the improvement was uneven across and within sectors. Steady, modest   growth was reported by various firms that supply or serve manufacturers. These   firms expect continued overall growth from their manufacturing clients, despite   citing ongoing small factory closures. Firms experiencing growth often cited   business returning from China and India, or other market share gains. Other   firms cited growth from Marcellus shale gas activity or from new product   launches. Factors cited as impeding growth included underfunded public   infrastructure, work going to China and India, and ongoing political   uncertainty. The makers of food products, lumber and wood products, and primary   metals reported declining product demand. Much of their decline is seasonal;   they retained positive expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third District manufacturers expect business conditions to improve during the   next six months, despite persistent uncertainties. Since the last Beige Book,   the general outlook has improved substantially, with few firms expecting a   decline, while most are divided between no change and some increase.   Expectations of capital spending and future hiring have nearly doubled among   area manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District retailers reported October sales   gains compared with September as well as with year-ago levels. Cold weather and   an early snowstorm triggered buying of sweaters and other cold weather gear.   Prospects for holiday sales vary with the market segment. High-end, online, and   outlet retailers are most optimistic. However, a concern was expressed over   supply disruptions to some consumer electronics from the flooding in Thailand.   Beyond the holiday season, a conventional mall retail contact expects sales to   be down in 2012 from 2011, while an outlet mall contact anticipates new mall   openings in the fall of 2012 and in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto sales continued to grow steadily in October, according to Third District   auto dealers. The sellers' market also continued â€“ boosting profits â€“ as used   cars remained scarce and as supply disruptions are recurring for Honda and   Toyota, this time from Thailand's floods. Inventories remained lean. Pent-up   demand for Japanese models may delay a return to normal price competition until   well after supply has normalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District bankers have reported slight   overall growth in loan volumes since the previous Beige Book. However, one   banker described margins being squeezed as banks compete for share in a flat   market. Another indicated they were picking up loans as foreign banks retreated   from the market. Prompted by low interest rates, the strongest loan growth   occurred in commercial real estate, home equities, and home mortgages,   especially refinancings. C&amp;I lending was flat. Credit quality continues to   improve but at a slower rate. Among Third District bankers interviewed in   November, business plans for 2012 assume further modest loan growth and   challenging competition within markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential building   activity has increased somewhat since the previous Beige Book, while reports on   existing homes sales indicated no change. Existing sales remain lower than last   year's levels. Large print ads recently touted record low interest rates, low   prices, and high affordability, possibly prompting the flurry of activity noted   by one New Jersey builder. Buyers selected mostly a range of mid- to high-priced   build-to-suit homes. These price points were also strong for a Pennsylvania   builder as were lower-priced multifamily townhomes aimed at move-up and   entry-level buyers. One builder noted that producers of many construction   materials have shut down and that the supply stream will require 12 to 18 months   to start up again after demand for residential construction picks up. There is   no change in the relatively weak outlook among builders and real estate   agents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonresidential real estate sectors reported mixed results with leasing   strength in select markets but few gains in construction. Investment interest   has strengthened in multifamily properties, while leasing activity grew for   trophy office space (desired by large legal firms) and for research facilities   (for new and expanding biotechnology firms). Demand for retail space continues   to weaken. Public infrastructure spending remains low. Beyond generally weak   demand, an architect cites regulatory burdens for permits and financing as   barriers. New construction or renovation plans are mostly limited to   institutional, life sciences, multifamily, and warehousing sectors in select   markets. Some construction activity for warehousing represents site relocations   within the three-state region. Construction/maintenance work has also slowed in   advance of three anticipated oil refinery shutdowns. The overall outlook for   demand of nonresidential space is for continued slow growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Third District service-sector firms have   reported modest growth since the last Beige Book. Advertising was noted as a   little soft with a particular weakness in retail. Freight volumes continue to   grow, reaching pre-recession levels, according to a logistics firm. Staffing   firms indicated that demand is slowing and that virtually all new placements are   on a temporary or contract basis, rather than permanent, full-time hires.   High-skilled workers, ranging from welders to new hires with business   intelligence skills, remain in short supply. Staffing contacts expected little   or no improvement by year's end; one was also less bullish for 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Wages
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Few price changes have been reported   since the previous Beige Book. One broad business sector supplier announced   widespread price hikes for early December. Pricing power remains favorable for   freight shippers and auto dealers. Most other sectors report very tight margins,   although cost factors have generally remained flat. A few exceptions include   cotton products for retailers and drywall for builders. Many bankers, builders,   and leasing agents continued to report expectations for concessions from   borrowers, buyers, and renters, respectively. Staffing firms reported no upward   pressure on wages.
