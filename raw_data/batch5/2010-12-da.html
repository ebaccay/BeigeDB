      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy expanded at a modest pace over the past six   weeks. Activity in the energy sector strengthened, and transportation services   and staffing firms reported steady but solid demand. Retailers said apparel   sales were slow due to unseasonably warm weather, while reports from the   manufacturing sector were mixed. Activity in the housing market remained   sluggish but conditions improved slightly in commercial real estate. Overall   lending conditions were largely unchanged. Most respondents expect slow growth   in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Selling prices and fees held steady at most   responding firms due to competition and low sales activity, but there were some   reports of increases. Small parcel shipping prices rose slightly while large   parcel shipping prices increased sharply, according to contacts. Fabricated   metals producers noted selling prices edged up in response to higher steel   prices and primary metals manufacturers reported price increases were becoming   necessary to offset higher cost of aluminum and other industrial metals.   Agricultural respondents said crop prices increased across the board, and   staffing firms reported upward movement in billing rates. Improved demand has   enabled railroads to raise prices across various business units.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of crude oil rose moderately on stronger demand from China and a   weaker dollar. On-highway prices of both diesel and gasoline increased. Natural   gas prices remained weak as mild weather, record-high inventories and forecasts   for a normal winter put downward pressure on prices. Solid demand, tight   supplies, and multiple plant outages led ethylene producers to push through a 4   cent increase in contract prices for October, and spot prices rose sharply in   response.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment levels held steady at most   responding firms, and there were scattered reports of hiring. Staffing firms   continued to report strong hiring activity in the region, and noted that they   were adding workers in response. Some contacts in the airline, transportation   services, automobile sales and transportation manufacturing industries added   workers, and retailers were starting to ramp up hiring for the holiday season.   Layoffs remained limited. Wage pressures were minimal, with the exception of   reports of higher wages in the airline industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for construction-related products   was flat over the past six weeks, but a few manufacturers said sales rose due to   an uptick in multifamily housing activity. Contacts expect conditions to remain   weak or improve slightly in 2011 due to continued weakness in residential and   commercial real estate. Fabricated metals producers saw a sharp increase in   demand over the past month due to seasonal factors and government-related   project work.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most high-tech manufacturers said growth in orders and production continued   at a much slower pace than in the first half of the year. Sales of some consumer   products such as personal computers and laptops slowed, but demand for gaming   products and smart phones remained strong. Several respondents expressed concern   about reduced demand from the public sector as governments at all levels were   faced with large revenue shortfalls. Still, most respondents expected conditions   to remain stable for the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for paper products held steady. Food manufactures said growth in   orders was stable over the reporting period, and the three-month outlook for   sales was positive. Trailer manufacturers reported a slowdown in demand.   Contacts in aircraft parts distribution and manufacturing saw an increase in   demand due to higher utilization of aircraft fleets and deferred maintenance   work.
     </p>
     Demand for petrochemicals was solid. Ethylene and polyethylene   producers reported that domestic demand increased moderately, and export demand   stayed strong--driven by cheap natural gas versus relatively expensive oil and a   weaker dollar. Domestic orders for PVC used in residential and commercial   construction remained depressed, but exports were strong, according to contacts.   Demand for petrochemicals used in manufacturing, alumina, pulp and paper   improved.
     <p>
      Refiners said conditions remained weak. Demand for oil products continued to   decline and refiner margins were being squeezed by the rise in oil prices.   Refinery utilization rates stood just above 80 percent, down from 90 percent   this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Eleventh District retail sales grew modestly,   despite unseasonably warm weather that impacted apparel sales for much of the   reporting period. In recent weeks, however, clothing retailers noted sales   improved as temperatures fell to more normal levels. Two large retailers said   that their sales in Texas outperformed those nationwide. Inventories increased   slightly due to the warm weather and some seasonal buildup. The retail   environment remains extremely competitive, and contacts say they still have to   lure consumers with promotions. Expectations are for the holiday shopping season   to yield moderate year-over-year sales increases. Contacts expect continued   improvement in 2011, although most expect the pace to be slow to moderate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales were slightly weaker over the reporting period, by more than   normal seasonality would suggest. Inventories rose, but remain at healthy   levels, according to contacts. A typical slowdown in sales is expected heading   into the holiday season, but the outlook for next year is cautiously optimistic,   with most contacts predicting modest growth in sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms reported steady demand, and noted   that activity was stronger than expected. Demand continued to be broad-based,   with particular strength reported for oil field operations, administrative and   professional services, plastics and steel manufacturing, and automobile-related   positions. Direct placements, which had been subdued so far this year, increased   during the reporting period. Sustained high levels of demand continued to boost   the near-term outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Accounting firms said some increase in consulting and merger and acquisition   work has kept demand stable. Uncertainty regarding impending tax legislation   continued to constrain demand for transactional services, but contacts were   generally optimistic about year-end earnings. Demand for legal services remained   soft. The only area of increased activity is mergers and acquisitions. Legal   firms say they are in a better position than last year, but remain cautious in   their outlooks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation services demand was positive. Intermodal transportation firms   noted a wide-spread increase in cargo volumes was buoyed by demand from   international clients. Railroad contacts said continued solid gains in volumes   boosted revenues. International container trade volumes rose slightly during the   past four weeks, and contacts expect a modest pickup in container traffic next   year. Firms that ship small parcel goods said growth in volumes flattened during   the reporting period, but remained above year-ago levels. Airline traffic was   steady over the past six weeks. Contacts noted that conditions are much better   than a year ago, and the outlook is for modest growth in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing markets remain   sluggish. Builders said sales weakened slightly in October after some firming in   August and September that followed the homebuyer tax-credit drop off. While   entry-level builders were said to be struggling, builders in the move-up price   range have weathered the post tax-credit conditions better, according to   contacts. Realtors also said the higher end of the market is selling better, a   reversal of the late 2009 and early 2010 trend. Prices were up slightly from   year-earlier levels. Respondents said lenders still require a 20 percent down   payment in most cases, which may be more difficult for the entry-level   homebuyer. Outlooks are for sales and building activity to remain slow in the   near-term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment demand continued to rise steadily during the reporting period, and   occupancies edged up. Rents are moving up, according to contacts. Construction   activity remains low by historical standards, but it has picked up slightly in   recent weeks. Investment activity for multifamily properties has risen since the   last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office leasing continues to edge up, which is "giving people a little more   confidence," according to contacts. Respondents in the industrial sector also   noted increased lease deals, but said rents are near historic lows. Excess space   and tight credit conditions have limited nonresidential construction. Investment   activity remains subdued, but contacts say recent signs of economic improvement   should enable more risk-taking in the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial firms reported a slight   pickup in demand for selected loan types and a continued tapering off for   others, noting that demand remained very price sensitive. Consumer loan growth   was modest, but dependent on low rates. Demand for commercial and industrial   loans increased, although real estate loan demand continued to decline. Overall   credit quality was stable; however, mortgage delinquencies and mortgage   bankruptcies remained elevated. Financial contacts noted continued pricing   pressure, particularly for consumer and good-quality business loans. Deposits   were stable. Outlooks improved modestly, but contacts anticipate loan growth to   remain sluggish because of economic and public policy uncertainties, as well as   borrowers' poor credit ratings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The Eleventh District rig count rose strongly over   the past six weeks. The disparity between oil and natural gas prices continued   to drive the trend toward more oil-directed drilling. U.S. land drilling is the   strongest and most profitable segment of the industry, especially activity tied   to horizontal drilling. Contacts expect the overall rig count to level off or   increase at a slower pace through year-end as the decline in dry natural gas   activity is not being offset by increased oil-directed drilling. Producers are   interested in returning to the Gulf now that the moratorium is over, and are   working their way through the new regulations and their cost implications.   Service companies are maintaining the skills and capacity to go back to the   Gulf, but do not expect it to happen before early next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Topsoil moisture was short in several parts   of the District, and moderate drought conditions prevailed in East Texas and   along the Rio Grande. Ranchers were concerned that lack of rainfall was   hampering winter grazing and hay production. Higher grain prices boosted margins   for farmers but increased feed costs for livestock producers. Cotton prices were   at record-high levels, and estimates for Texas cotton production put this year's   crop near historic highs for the state. Demand for agricultural products   remained strong, with particularly robust export demand for cotton and beef.
