      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The pace of economic activity in the Seventh District moderated in October   and early November. While contacts generally were cautiously optimistic about   the economic outlook, many also expressed concern over the increasingly risk   adverse business environment. Consumer spending increased, while business   spending was steady. Manufacturing production also increased, with growth   leveling off over the reporting period. Construction was again subdued, although   nonresidential construction increased slightly. Credit conditions were little   changed. Wholesale price increases slowed, but there was some further   pass-through to the retail level. Corn, soybean, and cattle prices were up from   early October, while milk and hog prices were down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending increased in October   and early November. Retailers reported moderate sales growth with consumers   responding to an increase in promotions during the reporting period. Contacts   expected retailers to use extended promotional periods and heavy discounting in   an effort to keep traffic volumes steady over the upcoming holiday shopping   season. Auto sales also increased in October, but the sales pace slowed in early   November. Dealers indicated that consumers may be waiting to see what end-of-the   year deals will be offered; they also were concerned that recent stock market   volatility would weigh on consumer confidence and willingness to spend.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business spending was steady in October   and early November. Several manufacturers said that they were reluctant to build   inventories, as the elevated uncertainty surrounding the European and Asian   economies had led them to take a "hand-to-mouth" attitude towards ordering. In   contrast, contacts generally reported moving ahead with planned purchases of   equipment and software. Most, however, indicated that hiring plans remained   limited. Labor market conditions deteriorated, with some additional layoffs   announced and unemployment in the District edging higher. In addition, growth in   billable hours continued to moderate for staffing and professional services,   although one staffing firm noted that permanent placements were increasing   offsetting some of the decline in the demand for temporary workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Construction activity was   again subdued in October and early November. Residential real estate conditions   remained depressed. Builders reported very little new single-family home   construction, and showroom traffic was steady at a low level. Multi-family   construction was stronger in comparison. Nonresidential construction increased   moderately. Contacts cited continued growth in the industrial sector and an   uptick in demand for medical and professional office space, while retail   construction remained very slow. Commercial real estate conditions were little   changed on balance with only a slight decline in vacancy rates reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Growth in manufacturing production   increased further in October before leveling off in early November. Demand for   heavy equipment remained strong, led by robust activity in the energy sector.   Contacts expected the growth in demand for equipment to moderate going forward,   but also noted that the need to replace aging capital would continue to boost   demand into next year. Manufacturers of specialty industrial metals also   reported greater activity, driven in large part by the auto sector and exports.   Auto production in the District continued to steadily improve, although the   recent flooding in Thailand was reported to have challenged supply chains and   impeded the recovery of dealer inventories of Japanese vehicles. Several   contacts cited concerns that going forward moderately higher production levels   would begin to strain capacity in the supply chain. In contrast, capacity   utilization in the steel industry decreased, and orders coming into service   centers were described as spotty. Furthermore, manufacturers of household   appliances and construction materials reported declining demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Credit conditions were little changed   on balance during the reporting period. Volatility in equity markets remained   elevated, and some additional flight to quality further boosted the demand for   Treasury debt. Contacts noted the bankruptcy filing of MF Global Holdings Ltd.   was disruptive for the company's former clients, with missing funds and   uncertainty about the status of their futures and options positions limiting   their ability to manage risk. Corporate funding costs generally edged lower as   spreads narrowed relative to low benchmark interest rates. Banking contacts   indicated that business loan demand continued to be muted by clients' reluctance   to take on growth-oriented projects due to economic and political uncertainty.   In addition, the lower liquidity in high yield and term loan markets did not   seem to be causing much substitution of leveraged financing from bond and   syndicated loan markets into individual bank loans. Business loan quality was   noted to be stabilizing, with little additional improvement expected in the   near-term.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Cost pressures remained elevated, even   though raw materials prices declined further in October and early November.   Steel prices, in particular, moved lower over the reporting period. Contacts   again reported extended lead times for specialty metals. In addition, tires were   reported to be in shortage, with a contact indicating tight supplies are likely   to persist until new plants come on-line in 2013. Wholesale price increases   slowed, but cost pressures remained elevated for food, fabrics, diesel fuel, and   shipping. Retailers reported they were absorbing most of these higher costs in   their margins, but some pass-through to downstream prices continued. Wage   pressures remained moderate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The corn and soybean harvests were running   ahead of pace in the District, though yields were coming in below trend. For the   District as a whole, more bushels of corn were harvested than a year ago, but   soybean production was down. Crop storage on farms increased, as many farmers   are expecting to sell their crops for higher prices in the future. This higher   farm storage has led to relatively lighter supplies at grain elevators for this   time of year, and end users, including ethanol plants, faced the prospect of   higher prices. Corn, soybean, and cattle prices were up from early October,   while milk and hog prices were down. With the exception of soybeans, these   prices were up from last year, boosting farm incomes. There was another surge in   farmland values and cash rental rates for the District.
