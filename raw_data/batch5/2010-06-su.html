      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and based   on information collected on or before May 28, 2010. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity continued to improve since the last report across all   twelve Federal Reserve Districts, although many Districts described the pace of   growth as "modest." Consumer spending and tourism activity generally increased.   Business spending also rose, on net, with employment and capital spending edging   up but inventory investment slowing. By sector, nonfinancial services,   manufacturing, and transportation continued to gradually improve. Residential   real estate activity in many Districts was buoyed by the April deadline for the   homebuyer tax credit. Commercial real estate remained weak, although some   Districts reported an increase in leasing. Financial activity was little changed   on balance, although a few Districts noted a modest increase in lending. Spring   planting was generally ahead of the normal pace, while conditions in the natural   resource sectors varied across the Districts. Prices of final goods and services   were largely stable as higher input costs were not being passed along to   customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending improved   from the previous report. Spending continued to be concentrated in necessities   as opposed to discretionary big-ticket items. Retail sales increased in April   and May, although several Districts noted that the gains were uneven across   months. Sales of spring and summer apparel were strong in the Boston, New York,   Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Sales of home   improvement and lawn and garden equipment were reported to have strengthened in   the Richmond, Chicago, and San Francisco Districts. Modest improvement in sales   of discretionary home goods was noted by Cleveland, Kansas City, and San   Francisco. Vehicle sales also rose, but the rate of increase reportedly slowed   in May in the New York, Cleveland, and San Francisco Districts. Tourism activity   improved. Dallas reported a continued increase in leisure air travel. Hotel   occupancy rates rose in the New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San   Francisco Districts, and convention activity increased in Atlanta and San   Francisco. Richmond reported resort bookings for the Memorial Day holiday   weekend were stronger than last year, and Atlanta indicated cruise-line bookings   were up slightly. Atlanta also reported, however, that the Gulf oil spill and   Tennessee floods had already resulted in some vacation lodging cancellations.   The potential exists for a much greater impact, although contacts are quite   uncertain as to the ultimate effects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending increased moderately   from the previous report. Cleveland, Chicago and Dallas noted that growth in   manufacturers' inventories was leveling off, while Boston, Atlanta, and St.   Louis reported the same for retailers' inventories. In contrast, several   Districts reported that auto production was failing to keep up with demand,   pressuring already lean auto dealer stocks. Capital spending was slightly higher   in a number of Districts, although several indicated that continuing caution on   the part of firms and tight credit availability were limiting expenditures. The   manufacturing, transportation, and energy industries accounted for most of the   increase in spending on plant and equipment. Boston reported that spending on   information technology services increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonfinancial service activity was   slightly improved, on balance, from the previous report. Several Districts   highlighted some strength in demand for professional technical services, such as   software and information technology, engineering, and other scientific trades.   In contrast, sluggishness remained in accounting, legal, marketing, media, and   construction services. Demand for business support services was more mixed.   Philadelphia and Chicago reported slightly higher demand while Boston and St.   Louis noted that demand remained weak. St. Louis also indicated that budget cuts   had led to reduced government and education services.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing and   transportation activity continued to gradually improve across all twelve   Districts. Most Districts reported further increases in factory production,   shipments, and new orders, although Philadelphia and Chicago noted that the pace   of gains had slowed in May. Steel producers and metals manufacturers reported   moderately higher production in Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, and Dallas,   although Chicago indicated capacity utilization leveled off in May. Auto and   parts production increased in the Cleveland, Richmond, and Chicago Districts.   Oil refinery capacity utilization was up in the Dallas District. Higher   residential construction increased demand for construction equipment and   materials in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco   Districts. Chicago also noted that demand from Asia and South America for heavy   equipment continued to be robust. The output of medical equipment and   pharmaceuticals remained strong in Boston and Chicago, as did high-tech   manufacturing in Boston, St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Food   processing increased in Dallas and San Francisco. Trucking and rail activity   increased, with freight traffic and raw material shipments on the rise in   Cleveland, Atlanta, and Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity improved since the last report. Most Districts noted an increase in   home sales and construction prior to the April 30th deadline for the homebuyer   tax credit, with contacts in many of these Districts also indicating a   corresponding slowing in activity in May. Tight credit, the elevated inventory   of homes available for sale, and the "shadow inventory" of foreclosed properties   on banks' balance sheets held back residential development in the New York,   Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts. Commercial real estate activity   generally remained weak. Office, industrial, and retail vacancy rates continued   to drift upward in many Districts putting downward pressure on rents. However,   lower rents were said to have led to an increase in leasing activity in New   York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The   elevated inventory of existing properties for sale or rent continued to weigh on   new private nonresidential construction. However, stronger industrial demand was   noted in several Districts. Public construction increased in Philadelphia,   Cleveland, and Chicago, but slowed in Minneapolis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial activity was little changed   on balance from the previous report. Commercial and industrial lending by banks   remained weak in most Districts, although Philadelphia, Chicago, Dallas, and San   Francisco noted business loan demand was firming. Philadelphia also indicated an   increase in business lending by non-depository financial companies, and New York   reported that underwriting and investment banking activity strengthened.   Consumer lending weakened in most Districts. In contrast, real estate lending   increased even though standards on these loans remained tighter than on other   loans, particularly for commercial mortgages. Chicago noted that the secondary   market for residential mortgages was beginning to improve, and private equity   investment in commercial properties increased in Boston, Chicago, and Dallas.   Loan quality was indicated to be stabilizing or gradually improving in most   Districts, but remained an issue for banks with large exposures to real estate.   Contacts in some Districts cited concerns over the potential impact of the   European fiscal crisis on financial and business conditions, and reported a   corresponding increase in uncertainty and financial market volatility.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop planting was   generally ahead of the seasonal norm, particularly in the Chicago, Minneapolis,   and Dallas Districts, although soybean planting was lagging in St. Louis and   Kansas City. Crop emergence was also ahead of the typical pace. Precipitation   conditions were generally positive, with the exception of flooding in Tennessee   and dryness in parts of the Richmond and Dallas Districts. Prices for hogs,   cattle, and cotton were higher, while prices for grains, soybeans, and milk were   roughly unchanged. Mining and energy industry activity varied across Districts.   According to contacts in the Atlanta District, the Gulf oil spill had little   immediate effect on oil production, although it had damaged fishing   operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions   improved slightly with permanent employment levels edging up in most Districts.   In addition, many Districts again noted an increase in temporary hires, with   Boston and Dallas also indicating a pick up in temporary-to-permanent   transitions. By industry, manufacturing was the most often cited source of   employment gains (both temporary and permanent), and Cleveland, Minneapolis, and   Dallas noted an increase in the manufacturing workweek. Other sources of   increased employment were the biopharmaceutical industry in Boston, retail trade   in Chicago, and transportation in Dallas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage pressures were limited, although San Francisco noted upward pressure on   employee benefit costs. Prices of final goods and services were largely   unchanged in most Districts as higher input costs were not being passed along to   customers and wage pressures continued to be minimal. Steel prices in many   Districts moved higher, as did lumber and food prices, while energy prices   generally declined. Several Districts noted tighter commodity supply conditions,   with Richmond and Kansas City indicating an increase in supplier lead times and   Boston and Atlanta reporting supply chain capacity constraints. Transportation   costs moved up in the Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and San Francisco   Districts, but diesel fuel cost pressures eased in New York.
