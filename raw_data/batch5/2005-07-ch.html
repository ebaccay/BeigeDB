      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate 

  pace during June and early July, though activity in Michigan lagged. Consumer 

  spending increased modestly during June, as did business spending and hiring. 

  Construction and real estate activity was quite brisk in much of the District. 

  The manufacturing sector continued to expand at a solid pace. Mortgage lending 

  kept pace with home sales, while commercial loan demand increased modestly. 

  Overall cost and price pressures remained moderate. The drought expanded and 

  has now affected all of the District' states, contributing to a rise in corn 

  and soybean prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased gradually during June. One area retailer attributed 

  most of the pick-up to better weather during the month, adding that consumers 

  seemed more focused on buying "needs-based" goods rather than discretionary 

  items. Apparel sales were said to be strong. Retail inventories were slightly 

  higher. Auto sales in the District increased in line with national trends, though 

  one contact thought the new employee discount marketing programs did not benefit 

  sales in the Detroit area as much as in other areas. One auto dealer in northern 

  Indiana said sales in early July slowed to a more average pace. Tourism spending 

  continued to increase steadily, with reports of increased demand for hotel rooms 

  in Chicago and Michigan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending continued to expand at a modest pace. Several contacts noted 

  that they had increased capital spending as planned, and others reported that 

  the investment climate remained positive. Trucking volumes held steady through 

  the end of the second quarter. One trucking contact said that an inventory correction 

  among their retail customers had restrained activity, but overall conditions 

  in the shipping industry remained good. A Wisconsin utility reported a rise 

  in power demand during the first six months of the year. Labor market conditions 

  improved slightly overall, but conditions varied by location and industry. Job 

  markets in Wisconsin and Indiana were better than those in Michigan. Hiring 

  in the banking, trucking, and distribution industries reportedly increased. 

  By contrast, layoffs were reported by pharmaceutical and auto-supply firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction/real estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity was quite brisk in many of the District' 

  markets during June and early July. Residential real estate markets remained 

  active, with reports of more homes going on the market in Milwaukee and a solid 

  pace of condo conversions in Chicago. Homebuilders in Wisconsin added incentives 

  to help boost interest in some new properties. One homebuilder noted a decline 

  in sales in metro Detroit but stronger activity in Indiana and Illinois. The 

  news on commercial real estate was more positive than that of the previous reporting 

  period. Contacts described commercial activity as "busier than normal" and "fast 

  paced." However, activity in Michigan was slower than elsewhere in the District, 

  and there were reports of weakness in office markets in a number of locations. 

  Commercial occupancy rates and rents were stable on balance, though one contact 

  was adding incentives to attract new clients to some properties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand at a solid pace in the District during 

  June and early July. Automakers reported a slight pick-up in sales in the first 

  two weeks of July and expected sales for the month to be higher than June. Light 

  truck sales were stronger than car sales, and one contact felt that the new 

  incentives were offsetting consumers' concerns about higher gas prices. Industry 

  contacts revised up their sales forecasts for the year, but left production 

  plans unchanged. Toolmakers reported a solid sales pace in June, and one added 

  that early indications suggest that sales in July will be strong as well. Office 

  furniture producers reported solid growth in domestic sales. Activity in the 

  heavy equipment market continued to be brisk, with production increasing and 

  backlogs remaining high. One contact in the industry noted that sales of construction 

  equipment remained very healthy, though retail sales of small tractors had declined 

  slightly in the U.S. and Europe, perhaps because of drought conditions. Tire 

  shortages were still limiting production of heavy equipment and heavy-duty trucks, 

  though one contact said that a major tire maker was increasing capacity for 

  large tires, potentially easing that constraint.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking/finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity generally continued to increase during June and early July. 

  Demand for home-purchase mortgages was solid. Refinancing was mixed by location, 

  with a Chicago bank reporting a modest pick-up and a Michigan bank reporting 

  little change. The mix between adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgages was 

  stable. Business loan demand continued to increase modestly, led by strength 

  in commercial real estate loans. Nonetheless, several bankers said that competitive 

  pressures were lowering margins on commercial lending and resulting in easing 

  standards and terms for such loans. Business credit quality remained in good 

  shape with many firms flush with cash. One exception was the auto-supply industry, 

  where many banks expressed concern about the financial health of their customers. 

  One analyst reported that venture capital in the Chicago area increased for 

  the first time since 2000, adding that there was "renewed excitement and enthusiasm" 

  for investing in local technology start-ups.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices/costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall cost and price pressures remained moderate. Higher material costs were 

  noted for energy, resins, and some construction materials. Firms most directly 

  affected by higher energy costs, such as those in trucking and air travel, said 

  that they were able to offset most of the higher costs through surcharges and 

  fare increases. However, one trucker noted that shippers who tried to raise 

  rates too aggressively had lost customers. Manufacturers of heavy equipment, 

  wallboard, and tools reported a new round of price hikes, though a heavy equipment 

  maker reported some resistance to its increases. Reports of retail price increases 

  outnumbered the reports of decreases. New car prices fell, not only for retail 

  customers but also for corporate fleets. Wage gains remained modest overall, 

  except in some skilled professions with shortages. With regard to costs for 

  benefits, a large health insurance firm in Michigan announced plans to implement 

  the smallest premium increase in a decade.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions deteriorated in most of the District, contributing to a rise 

  in corn and soybean prices. The drought expanded and deepened, despite some 

  rainfall in early July. Illinois continued to be hit hardest, though at least 

  part of each state in the District experienced drought conditions. In Iowa, 

  crop development has been quite good, but some areas are at risk if they do 

  not receive timely rains. District bankers were apprehensive about some farmers' 

  poor risk management, especially with respect to inadequate crop insurance. 

  Dairy farms generally did well in the reporting period, as milk prices increased. 

  Livestock producers remained profitable overall, though cattle feeders were 

  pressured by lower prices for cattle.
