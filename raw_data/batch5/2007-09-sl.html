      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eighth District    has continued to expand at a moderate pace since our previous report. Retail    sales are generally up from the previous year, although some weakness has    been noted in furniture and auto sales. Manufacturing activity continued to    increase, albeit somewhat unevenly.    Home sales and residential construction remain weak throughout most of    the District, but commercial construction activity remains strong in most    areas. Overall lending activity at District banks has remained steady. Contacts report that recent financial    market volatility has had little impact on District banks, with problems    limited to specific subsectors. Ongoing drought conditions are taking a toll    on agriculture in most parts of the District. Crop yields for corn, soybeans,    and cotton are all expected to be adversely affected by continuing dry, hot    conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in    July and the first half of August were up 8 percent, on average, over year-earlier    levels. About 55 percent of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 32    percent saw decreases. Approximately 63 percent of the retailers noted that    sales levels met their expectations, 32 percent reported that sales were    lower than anticipated, and 5 percent reported sales above expectations.    Jewelry, men's apparel, books, and sofas were strong sellers, while women's    apparel and furniture (especially bedroom and dining room items) were moving    more slowly. About 56 percent of the contacts noted that inventories were at    desired levels. Many of those reporting higher-than-desired inventories plan    to use more discounting than usual. The majority of retailers are positive    about the sales outlook for September and October, with about 62 percent of    contacts expecting sales in those months to increase over 2006 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that, compared    with last year, sales in July and the first half of August were down 6    percent, on average. About 65 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported a    decrease in sales, while 27 percent reported an increase. Approximately 35    percent of the respondents reported recent increases in rebates and    incentives, while 8 percent reported fewer rebates. About 15 percent reported    more rejections of finance applications, but 12 percent of the contacts    reported more acceptances. About 27 percent of the car dealers surveyed    reported that their inventories were too high (mostly on    trucks and SUVs), while the same percentage reported that their inventories    were too low (mostly on fuel-efficient and used vehicles). Slightly more than    half of the car dealers expect increased sales in September and October; the    remaining contacts are divided equally between expectations for unchanged    sales and lower sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business    Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity has continued to    expand since our previous report.    However, contacts expressed some concern about future growth. Firms in    the fabricated metal manufacturing industry reported plans to hire additional    workers. Contacts in the aerospace product and parts manufacturing,    nonmetallic mineral products, and the transportation equipment industries    reported plans to expand existing facilities and operations. Manufacturing    firms in the areas of power transmission equipment, manufactured homes,    chemicals, and pharmaceuticals reported plans to open new facilities in the    District. Conversely, manufacturing firms in the apparel, electrical    equipment, household appliances, motor vehicle parts, and plastics announced    that they will close plants in the District.    The net impact of these developments is positive, with new and    expanded operations more than offsetting cutbacks in other areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's service sector has    continued to expand steadily since our previous report. Contacts in the    business support services and educational services industries reported plans    to hire additional workers in the District. A firm in the air transportation    industry reported plans to expand operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales and construction activity    have weakened in most parts of the District, although sales in the Louisville    area have remained stronger than in other regions. Compared with the same    period in 2006, July 2007 year-to-date home sales increased 2 percent in    Louisville but declined 2.4 percent in Little Rock, 6.7 percent in St. Louis,    and 12 percent in Memphis. Residential construction continued to decline    throughout most of the District. June 2007 year-to-date single-family housing    permits fell in nearly all metro areas compared with the same period in 2006.    Permits declined 26 percent in Memphis, 14 percent in Little Rock, and 10    percent in St. Louis. An exception to the downturn was in Louisville, where    permits increased 5.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets were mixed    throughout the District. The second quarter 2007 industrial vacancy rates in    Memphis, St. Louis, Louisville, and Little Rock all saw a slight increase    over the first quarter of 2007. During the same period, the office vacancy    rate increased slightly in Memphis and Louisville and decreased slightly in    St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a    sample of District banks showed little change in overall lending activity in    the three months ending in July. Credit standards for commercial and    industrial loans remained basically unchanged for both large and small firms,    while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker. Credit standards for commercial real estate    loans ranged from unchanged to somewhat tightened, while demand for these    loans was unchanged. Meanwhile, credit    standards for consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans    was moderately weaker. Demand for both    prime and nontraditional residential mortgage loans remained unchanged, while    credit standards for both types of loans ranged from basically unchanged to    slightly tighter.
     </p>
     <p>
      More recently, while contacts in the    banking industry have indicated some concern about financial market    volatility, none report any significant impact on their business. Mortgage    delinquency rates are up slightly over the past several months but problems    appear to be isolated. Credit availability has tightened considerably for    non-conforming loans, but agency-eligible loans are experiencing only minor    pricing issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought conditions have worsened in the    District since our previous report, especially in western Tennessee. The    extremely hot and dry weather has caused soil moisture ratings and pasture    conditions to deteriorate since mid-July. Also, a higher percentage of the    overall corn, soybean, cotton, and sorghum crops were rated poor or very    poor: Between 14 percent and 25 percent of each of those crops obtained poor    ratings, compared with 11 percent in July. As of August 1, yields for most    crops were expected to be at least 92 percent of last year's yields; however,    corn and soybean yields in Kentucky and Tennessee and winter wheat yields (in    all states except Mississippi) were expected to be less than 87 percent of    last year's yields.
