      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand at a moderate 
  pace during April. Spending by both consumers and businesses increased at rates 
  similar to those in the last report. Overall labor market conditions were little 
  changed, with small gains in employment on net. Manufacturing activity remained 
  strong. Residential construction and real estate activity softened. Demand for 
  commercial real estate space continued to expand, however the pace of new commercial 
  construction slowed. Mortgage demand was down, while the expansion in commercial 
  lending continued at a slower pace than in the last report. Nonlabor input cost 
  pressures intensified in April and May, while increases in retail prices and 
  wages were similar to the previous reporting period. Contacts reported that 
  planting went well in most of the District and that the growing season was off 
  to an excellent start.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to increase modestly in April and May. Retailers 
  in Illinois and Indiana reported that sales were up modestly from a year earlier, 
  while those in Michigan said that sales have been "inconsistent." 
  Apparel sold well, helped by favorable weather in the region. Demand for lawn 
  and garden items and electronics increased as well. High gasoline prices have 
  reportedly dampened spending growth; one contact in the Chicago area said that 
  fewer people were willing to drive to the city for weekend shopping trips. Retail 
  inventories were at desired levels. Auto dealers said that sales of new Big 
  3 vehicle sales were down but sales of foreign nameplates were up. Domestic 
  new vehicle inventories were above desired levels. Dealers reported that service 
  activity had softened, due to the slower pace of new vehicle sales in recent 
  months. A restaurant chain reported slower year-over-year gains in sales. Tourism 
  was steady in the District, though pre-booking activity was sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business spending and hiring expanded again. For the most part, capital spending 
  continued to increase at similar rates as in the previous reporting period. 
  One retail chain said that their purchases of high-tech equipment were unchanged 
  from a year ago but that their overall capital spending had increased modestly. 
  A manufacturing contact reported that the increase in their capital spending 
  was occurring offshore. Freighthauling continued to expand overall, though one 
  contact noted softer growth in shipments to discount retailers. Business travel 
  to Chicago was up noticeably, helped by a large number of conventions. Overall 
  labor market conditions were little changed, with small gains in employment 
  on net. One contact in Illinois characterized the growth in hiring as balanced 
  between high- and low-wage jobs. Factory employment ticked up. Shortages of 
  skilled manufacturing workers persisted, and one contact noted that manufacturing 
  firms were holding job fairs after abandoning the practice several years ago. 
  A temporary help firm said that labor demand in the District increased modestly 
  again, but noted that they had seen some weakening in billable hours growth 
  nationwide in the past two weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction and real estate activity was mixed by both location and market 
  segment. Residential activity continued to slow from high levels in most areas. 
  Contacts in Iowa and Michigan said that the demand for higher-priced homes had 
  slackened most. Most builders and real estate agents indicated that the supply 
  of new and existing homes for sale was growing and that homes were staying on 
  the market longer. In addition, new home construction and other residential 
  development activity slowed in most areas. Demand for commercial real estate 
  space continued to expand, however the pace of new commercial construction slowed. 
  A commercial contact in Chicago said: "Lots of money is still available 
  for real estate, but most of it is going after existing buildings. Rents are 
  too low to justify new construction." Commercial vacancy rates were little 
  changed overall. One contact, however, expressed concern about the potential 
  for overbuilding of large distribution centers in Indiana. Net absorption of 
  office space in Chicago continued at a solid pace, and demand was broad-based. 
  Contacts in Indiana reported strengthening demand for industrial space.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained strong during April and May. Demand for heavy 
  equipment continued to be solid, driven by mining, energy, and construction 
  demand. In contrast, orders of agricultural equipment weakened, and one industry 
  analyst expected sales to be down slightly for the year. Heavy-duty truck orders 
  have begun to tail-off, largely because order books are full for 2006 and there 
  are no more spots to pre-purchase trucks before new EPA standards go into effect 
  at the beginning of next year. Industry analysts said medium-duty truck order 
  books for 2006 had filled by the end of May and expected orders to fall off 
  precipitously. Revenues and order backlogs were up for many toolmakers, and 
  brisk quoting activity suggested continued strength going forward. The sentiment 
  of the toolmaking industry was "ecstatic," according to one contact. 
  Steel producers reported further growth in demand from all markets; the strongest 
  demand was for plate steel for oil pipelines. Steel inventories were below desired 
  levels. Wallboard production continued to edge up closer to full capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity moderated further. Bankers noted additional declines in mortgage 
  applications for both purchases and refinancing. Demand for home-equity loans 
  weakened as well, which was attributed to slower increases in home values. Mortgage 
  spreads remained tight, though one bank saw a marginal widening in recent weeks. 
  Reports on household credit quality were favorable, with mortgage delinquencies 
  remaining low; delinquencies on home equity loans stabilized after an uptick 
  earlier in the year. Commercial lending continued to expand, but at a marginally 
  slower pace than earlier in the year. Most of the slowdown was in commercial 
  real estate loans. Use of existing credit lines picked up, and one contact said 
  that they saw a rise in the number of requests to increase the existing credit 
  lines. One contact noted some slackening in the competitive pressures to ease 
  standards and terms on commercial loans and added that margins had stabilized. 
  Still, there were some concerns that loan pricing was not adequately reflecting 
  risk. Commercial credit quality remained in good shape, on balance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nonlabor input cost pressures intensified in April and May, while increases 
  in retail prices and wages were similar to the previous reporting period. Almost 
  all contacts reported higher energy costs. The ability to pass these cost increases 
  on to customers varied. Many manufacturers expressed concern about other materials 
  prices, noting gains in the cost of zinc, copper, and carbide. Steel prices 
  increased further since the last reporting period, and one contact said that 
  steelmakers were making up for some of the pricing restraint they had shown 
  at the start of the year. A construction industry analyst noted that uncertainty 
  about material costs has made it more difficult to decide on pricing strategies 
  for projects. Price reports at the consumer level were mixed. Retailers generally 
  reported a competitive pricing environment, though a few noted that they had 
  increased some prices. Hotel room rates were up, while new vehicle prices were 
  flat to slightly lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Planting proceeded smoothly in most of the District, though rains delayed activity 
  or forced some replanting, mostly in Indiana. However, southern Iowa still needed 
  more moisture to fully recover from drought. Some farmers switched to planting 
  corn rather than soybeans. At the end of May, the progress of corn and soybean 
  crops was excellent, creating the potential for "record busting yields if the 
  weather cooperates." Plans for additional biofuel plants in the District were 
  announced during the reporting period. Cow and calf ranchers avoided the operating 
  losses seen at cattle feedlots, since calf prices were better than feeder cattle 
  prices.
