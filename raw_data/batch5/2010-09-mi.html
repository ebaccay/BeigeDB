      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Ninth District economy grew modestly since the last report. Consumer   spending, tourism, residential construction, services, manufacturing, energy,   mining and agriculture saw increases. Activity in the commercial and residential   real estate sectors decreased, while commercial construction remained weak.   Labor markets strengthened slightly since the last report. Wage increases were   moderate, and prices increased modestly.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail spending increased   moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   July were up 2 percent compared with a year earlier, and a Minnesota-based   restaurant chain reported that recent sales increased moderately compared with a   year ago. July sales at two Minneapolis area malls were above year-ago levels,   and mall traffic seemed to hold steady during August. A retailer in Montana   noted that sales for appliances and electronics were up about 10 percent   compared with a year ago. In southwestern Montana, a furniture store reported   that recent sales increased; however, sales at a lumber and home improvement   retailer were down. A chamber of commerce representative in northwestern   Wisconsin noted that while retail sales had been tracking downward compared with   a year ago, there was a recent pickup due to solid tourism activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vehicle sales were up slightly in North Dakota, according to a representative   of an auto dealers association. The owner of a Minnesota domestic auto dealer   said that August sales were up from a year ago, but corporate customers were   more cautious about purchases.
      </p>
      Summer tourism activity was solid. Resorts in   north-central Minnesota reported that lodging revenue was up about 10 percent on   average compared with a year ago; restaurants also saw strong increases. Tourism   activity was above year-earlier levels in North Dakota, according to an   official. In western South Dakota, the number of visits and sales at attractions   were on par with last year's strong summer season. Visits to Yellowstone and   Glacier national parks were higher than a year ago, but on average tourists were   spending less.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial construction was   slow. Few large projects were under way in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.   Commercial permits in Montana were at about half of their year-ago levels for   both June and year-to-date. Commercial building in Fargo, N.D., has recently   slowed despite a relatively low unemployment rate in the area. Residential   construction continued its mild recovery. The number and value of August   residential permits in Minneapolis-St. Paul increased from both July and June   levels. The value of residential permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., was roughly flat   in July from a year earlier.
      </p>
      Activity in commercial real estate markets was   down. A commercial brokerage in Minneapolis said that while unused space   continued to increase, the rate of increase seemed to have slowed recently.   Vacancy rates there were at record highs; the retail sector was particularly   hard hit. A bank director in Billings, Mont., said market activity there was   down substantially and was expected to continue to drop. Recent residential real   estate activity decreased from a year earlier. July closed sales in   Minneapolis-St. Paul were down 40 percent from a year earlier; however, median   sales prices were up more than 2 percent.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the professional business services   sector increased since the last report. Contacts from the legal sector reported   that billings during July were up from a year ago, especially for firms that   deal with bankruptcies. A call center is expanding in South Dakota. Appraisers   and other professional services firms that support home refinancing reported   strong activity over the past month.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. A July survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed strong increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota and South   Dakota, and slight increases in North Dakota. A drainage pipe maker is opening a   plant in South Dakota. In Minnesota, two new solar energy component   manufacturing facilities are planned. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a   coated paper company noted an increase in orders over the past two months from   earlier this year and last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Late-August oil exploration increased   from mid-July. New wind energy projects are planned in the Dakotas. Most   District mines were operating at near capacity. Iron ore production in Minnesota   increased in July compared with June. Meanwhile, in the Upper Peninsula, a new   copper mine was under construction. A new coal mine was under consideration in   Montana. Exploration for a potash mine was under way in North Dakota.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural activity increased. Crop   conditions improved across most of the District. The price of wheat surged since   the last report. Sugar beet producers expected an early harvest with large   yields, but were concerned about a judge's ruling to halt the use of GMO seeds   until the conclusion of an environmental impact study. Meanwhile, the   Minneapolis Fed's second-quarter (July) survey of agricultural credit conditions   indicated that lenders expect overall agricultural income and capital spending   to decrease in the third quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages, and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor markets strengthened   slightly since the last report. After 25 straight months of year-over-year   employment decreases in Minnesota and Wisconsin, both states recently posted   modest year-over-year employment increases. Initial claims for unemployment   insurance in Minnesota were down 24 percent in July compared with July 2009, but   were still higher than July 2008 levels. A temporary staffing firm in Minnesota   noted that demand for industrial workers was even in July, but has picked up   somewhat in August.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite recent strengthening, overall labor market conditions remained weak.   In Minnesota, a hospital recently announced plans to eliminate up to 250   full-time positions by year-end. Two Minnesota state universities announced   layoffs of almost 40 tenure-track faculty in anticipation of future funding   cuts. There were plenty of qualified applicants available to fill open positions   in Montana. In addition, fewer foreign workers were needed to fill seasonal jobs   in Montana this past summer compared with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wage increases were moderate. Average wages for manufacturing employees in   District states for the three-month period ended in July 2010 were only 1   percent higher than the same period a year ago. A nurses union in Duluth, Minn.,   called for a one-day strike; staffing levels were the primary issue. In Montana,   a bank director noted that a number of employers were uncertain about their   obligations under the new health care system and therefore were hesitant to make   long-term commitments regarding benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall prices increased modestly. Minnesota gasoline prices decreased   slightly from mid-July through the end of August. Fertilizer prices were lower   than a year ago. Meanwhile, prices for copper and lead increased from mid-July   through the end of August.
