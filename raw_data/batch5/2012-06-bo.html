      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the First District continues to expand, with contacts in   most sectors citing steady growth. Commercial real estate markets show slight   improvement and residential real estate contacts are finally mentioning   recovery, albeit fragile. Respondents in this round rarely mention prices or   pricing. Except for software and IT services where growth continues to be   relatively strong, few firms are doing substantial hiring. The outlook is   generally for more of the same, although a couple of manufacturers mention   making contingency plans for a potential slowdown.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retail contacts continue to report   that business is good, consumer sentiment seems to be improving, and fears have   moderated about higher gasoline prices hurting spending in other categories.   Recent year-over-year sales changes range from near zero to gains of 2 percent   to 5 percent. One firm, buoyed by recent performance, has increased its overall   2012 sales forecast from 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent. Consumer spending is   particularly strong on adult clothing, household goods, and items related to   home improvement and maintenance. While respondents have generally positive   expectations for their businesses in 2012, some express concern that U.S.   economic growth will be hampered by domestic political tensions and potential   negative spillovers from a European economic downturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      The travel and tourism sector in the First District continues to report   strong results. Both business and leisure travel have been up in the first four   months of the year, and advance hotel bookings continue to be robust. For 2012,   the industry expects a 9.5 percent increase over 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to our   contacts, the manufacturing sector in the First District continues to grow, but   the outlook remains guarded, perhaps slightly more so than in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Thirteen of 16 responding firms report growing sales in the most recent   period compared with a year earlier. Idiosyncratic factors appear to be driving   the weakness for one firm with declining sales; contacts at the other two could   not point to anything other than general macroeconomic weakness as explanations.   A manufacturer of industrial motors mentions the situation in Europe while   noting that sales are soft in all regions in which the company sells.
     </p>
     <p>
      The jury is still out on the role of weather in the evolution of business   conditions over the last six months. Several of our contacts cited mysterious   sales declines at various points which then corrected themselves. A manufacturer   of hoses was off 30 percent at the end of March but then had his "best April   ever" and was back on plan by this round. He hypothesizes that winter goods   weren't selling, so big retailers--hoping to avoid having to store snow shovels   and road salt over the summer--lacked space until recently to put spring goods   on the shelves.
     </p>
     <p>
      Dramatic changes in U.S. energy supply continue to affect economic activity,   according to manufacturing respondents. A chemical manufacturer in the First   District said that the low current price of natural gas is restructuring the   world chemical industry. For the first time in decades, chemical firms are   building ethylene crackers in the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      All contacts doing business in Europe report that the European manufacturing   economy is near or in recession. Asia continues to be relatively strong, but one   contact in the industrial membrane business said that "the best and most stable   market" is the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fourteen of 16 contacts report that their firms are hiring; nonetheless, they   remain reluctant to add to headcount in any significant way. One manufacturer of   parts for the aerospace and automotive industry says that, despite strong   growth, they have relied mostly on temporary workers to increase production. A   contact in the industrial distribution business reports that if conditions do   not improve, they will cut staff. Another firm which makes industrial motors   says they are drawing up contingency plans for a serious decline which include a   hiring freeze.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Software and Information Technology Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England   software and information technology firms report mixed results through May, with   some experiencing continued growth and others citing modest slowdowns.   Nevertheless, year-over-year revenue increases in the first quarter remained   largely in the high-single digits, bolstered by steady demand from the   healthcare and banking sectors and a resurgence of activity in the manufacturing   sector. Indeed, one contact closed a deal in Q1 with a very large electronics   manufacturer, and another reports that deal sizes are beginning to grow,   particularly in their software solutions for manufacturers and distributors.   Other contacts, however, assert that clients in general remain reticent to   finalize large deals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most contacts report increases in headcount, with many continuing to add   sales and marketing personnel as well as billable consultants; by contrast, one   firm recently completed a realignment in which headcount was reduced by   approximately 5 percent. Capital and technology spending and selling prices have   gone largely unchanged since February. Looking forward, New England software and   IT contacts remain cautiously optimistic, with upticks in activity and strong   pipelines tempered by concerns regarding the U.S. economy and the European debt   crisis.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Staffing Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England staffing firms report that   business conditions are largely unchanged since the previous conversations in   February, with year-over-year revenue increases in the first quarter generally   in the mid-single digits. Labor demand from the healthcare and manufacturing   sectors is steady, and one contact reports renewed activity in the financial   sector. However, demand for office and clerical assistance has weakened in   recent weeks, and activity in the construction, civil engineering, and   accounting sectors remains anemic. The number of permanent and   temporary-to-permanent placements continues to grow, albeit modestly; however,   two contacts say this trend is likely attributable to their own internal efforts   to boost permanent hires, rather than improvements in labor-market fundamentals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding labor supply, candidates with high-end skill sets such as nurses,   mechanical and electrical engineers, and software developers remain difficult to   find; one contact reports that this shortage of qualified labor has begun to put   upward pressure on pay rates. Other contacts, however, say that increases in   bill rates and pay rates, if any, are due almost entirely to changes in their   business mix. The outlook among New England staffing contacts is generally   consistent with that of three months ago, with most expecting their current rate   of growth to continue or pick up through the end of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      According to contacts, commercial   property markets in the First District remain in a holding pattern, with some   signs of improvement. The strength of Boston's commercial market continues to   stand out within the region and nationally, making it the target of a tremendous   amount of investor interest. Construction activity in Boston appears to be   increasing--contacts report an uptick in large-scale build-to-suit construction   activity for the first time in several years. However, the market is still not   strong enough to warrant speculative construction. In Portland, construction   activity has increased significantly from the last report, propelled by projects   in the public, industrial office, and multifamily sectors. Elsewhere in the   First District, construction activity is muted. Strict lending standards are   still the norm District-wide.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite a recent uptick in showings, demand in the industrial sector remains   flat across New England. Office leasing volumes throughout the District are   unchanged from six weeks ago, and the retail sector continues to be quiet in New   England. The outlook among contacts is that, barring significant macroeconomic   turmoil, conditions should remain flat or improve slightly in the rest of the   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate shows   further signs of improvement in the First District as year-over-year increases   in sales continued in April across the region. Contacts report steady increases   in market activity, which they attribute to low interest rates and competitive   prices as well as confidence in economic conditions. In the Greater Boston area,   sales continue to increase while inventories fall to low levels, particularly in   the condominium market. Some respondents say activity among first-time   homebuyers has increased, reflecting continued affordability. Reports also   indicate increased activity for homes in the mid-price range. Changes in median   sales prices compared to a year ago vary across the First District, with some   states experiencing modest gains and others observing moderate declines. Rhode   Island, where the median sales price in April dropped almost 8 percent from a   year earlier, faced the largest price decline in the region, but the drop was   close to zero excluding distressed sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Though contacts characterize housing markets as recovering, they note that   conditions remain fragile; in particular, with sales gains fairly well   established, their concerns focus on the possibility of further price declines.   Contacts expect the delicate recovery of housing markets to continue gradually;   most anticipate modest gains in sales activity for the next several months and   modest price changes, up and down. Respondents say declining inventory levels   and increasing demand in Greater Boston may put upward pressure on prices there.
