      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy grew modestly    since the last report. Growth was noted in consumer spending, tourism,    services, commercial construction and real estate, manufacturing, energy,    mining and agriculture. Residential construction and real estate activity was    slow. A number of contacts reported tight labor conditions in their    industries or regions, and overall wage increases were moderate. Prices for    gasoline have eased since the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased moderately.    A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported it expects same-store sales to    increase about 6 percent in August compared with a year earlier. July sales    at a Montana mall were about 5 percent above last year's levels. A mall in    North Dakota reported traffic up about 2 percent in August compared with a    year ago. Steady traffic during late July and August was reported at a mall    in the Minneapolis area. Business at two Minnesota auto dealers was up over    the past couple of months, especially for more fuel-efficient vehicles.    However, looking forward, a contact noted that some retailers are concerned    about the impact year-end adjustments in mortgage interest rates could have on    household cash flow and holiday spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity was higher than a year ago. A    tourism official in South Dakota reported that activity was up about 8    percent in July compared with a year ago; relatively high gas prices didn't    seem to deter travelers to the area. Retailers and tourism-related businesses    in northwestern Wisconsin reported solid traffic and sales; dry, warm weather    generally helped tourism activity, although river water levels were low for    kayaking and canoeing. A tourism official in Montana reported year-to-date    visits to Glacier National Park up 11 percent and Yellowstone National Park    up 9 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Contacts from the professional business    services sector noted continued growth. Law firms reported strong billings    and increased competition. Contacts that support the health care industry saw    increased demand. Activity was up at an information technology consulting    firm. An executive search firm    reported that activity was "heating up." A representative from a large    management consulting firm indicated solid growth in billings and new    business. Contacts from the financial services industry reported some    disruptions to operations due to credit market constraints.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction    and Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Commercial construction was up. July commercial building    permits in St. Cloud, Minn., increased 15 percent from a year ago. Developers    announced plans for a 500,000 square foot retail center along the I-94 corridor in    Hudson, Wis. Minneapolis will receive $250 million in federal funds to replace    the collapsed I-35W bridge. Residential construction remained slow, but    showed signs of improvement in some areas. Permitted units in July were down    7 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul from a year earlier. In Sioux Falls, S.D.,    July residential permits were up 9 percent over year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate was up slightly.    Vacancy rates for office, industrial and medical space in Minneapolis-St.    Paul all declined through the second quarter of this year, though retail    vacancy increased slightly. A contact in Fargo, N.D., said market activity    there was moving at a healthy pace. Residential real estate was slow, with    some exceptions. Home sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul increased 2 percent from    June to July, but were down from year-earlier levels, and the inventory of    homes for sale is large and growing. However, in Sioux Falls, sales were on    track to match or beat last year's record levels. A director from western    Montana indicated sales are still strong, but inventory is up significantly    compared with the past two years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The manufacturing    sector grew since the last report. A July survey of purchasing managers by    Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) indicated increased manufacturing activity    in Minnesota and the Dakotas. In South Dakota, a trailer manufacturer    recently announced plans to build a new plant, and a mining equipment company    plans to expand a facility. In North Dakota, an agricultural processing plant    is expanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity    in the energy and mining sectors increased since the last report. New wind    energy projects were recently announced. Oil and gas exploration and    production in the District were level from previously reported amounts.    Production at most mines remained at near capacity; several mines are looking    to expand, and permitting activity is under way. An iron mining company plans    to build a nugget plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions improved since    the last report. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's recent survey    of agricultural credit conditions indicate that lenders expect overall    agricultural income and spending to be up in the third quarter of 2007 due to    higher selling prices and decent yields. Growers in North Dakota expect    higher income with a record wheat crop and strong prices. Bountiful fruit    harvests are occurring across the District. The U.S. Department of    Agriculture reported that crop progress was ahead of the five-year average    for many District crops. However,    yield expectations were reduced in many parts of the District due to    increased drought. Recent heavy rainfall caused flooding and crop loss in    southeastern Minnesota and western Wisconsin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A number of contacts reported tight    labor conditions in their industries or regions. While some employers in the    construction industry noted less difficulty finding workers than in the past    couple of years, finding qualified workers in a number of specialty trades    was difficult. In eastern South Dakota, companies in light industrial    manufacturing and health care were having trouble finding qualified workers.    An economist in Montana reported that employers often note difficulty finding    skilled and well-trained employees. Some fast food employers in Montana have    hired younger workers or have outsourced drive-through orders to a call    center. The opening of a bank call center this fall in northwestern Wisconsin    will create 70 jobs in the area. In contrast, a plant in Minnesota that makes    frozen products for retail bakeries and food services recently announced    plans to eliminate 95 jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall wage increases were moderate.    Wages for manufacturing workers increased 1.7 percent for the three-month    period ended in July. Hired workers at farms in Michigan, Wisconsin and    Minnesota were paid only 4 cents per hour more in July compared with the same    period a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices for gasoline have eased recently.    Minnesota gasoline prices in mid-August were almost 30 cents per gallon lower    than in mid-July and slightly lower than a year ago. Recent increases in natural gas prices    showed signs of easing in late August. A bank director noted that while    increases in health insurance costs remained relatively large, insurance    rates for workers' compensation were slightly lower than a year ago.
