      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21 , 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, information from Sixth District business contacts suggested that   economic activity pulled back somewhat in September. Retail and tourism-related   spending was below expectations according to most contacts, while automobile   dealers reported that sales had dropped following the expiration of the "cash   for-clunkers" program. Reports from real estate contacts indicated that home   sales continued to improve in most areas, although the pace of the improvement   slowed somewhat in September. Commercial real estate conditions deteriorated   further as vacancy rates rose, rents declined, and more planned commercial   projects were delayed or cancelled. A small majority of manufacturer contacts   noted a modest decline in production and orders in September. Most contacts in   the banking sector reported that credit conditions remained tight. The pace of   layoffs in the District continued to slow, but most contacts also indicated that   they were not looking to hire in the near term. Overall, inflationary pressures   remained subdued, with most contacts noting that input and output prices were   flat to down slightly over the month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail contacts   indicated that traffic and sales were somewhat below their modest expectations   in September. Both sales and inventory levels remained below year-ago levels.   Merchants were keeping inventories lean, managing them at "just in time" levels.   The outlook remained mixed, with roughly two-thirds of retail contacts   anticipating flat or declining sales over the next three months and one-third   expecting an increase. Auto dealers across the District reported poor traffic   and low sales of new vehicles in the wake of the cash-for-clunkers program. A   contact in the auto repair industry noted a further decline in activity that   they associated with the reduction in the stock of older vehicles because of the   program. Used-car sales held relatively steady over the month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism-related spending in the District remained weak in September. Industry   contacts reported that hotel reservations, particularly related to conventions,   were down. Room rates continued to decline, as well, in most locations.   Cruise-line occupancy rates remained solid. However, this was attributed to very   deep discounting. Hospitality industry contacts expect subdued activity to   persist over the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District homebuilders and   Realtors both reported that the pace of home sales had softened slightly since   the last report. Despite this, homebuilders noted an increase in traffic with   several contacts reporting that the credit quality of potential buyers had   improved as well. Demand for low- to mid-priced homes remained relatively   strong, supported by the first-time home buyer tax credit and increased interest   by investors. However, most contacts continued to note downward pressure on home   prices from foreclosures and short-sales. The majority of homebuilders and   contractors observed construction remained very low. The sales outlook among   both builders and Realtors over the next three months was less upbeat than   reported in August.
     </p>
     <p>
      Private-sector commercial real estate activity weakened further in September.   Vacancy rates continued to rise across all segments, and contacts continued to   cite downward pressure on rents. Developers reported fewer backlogs, and more   projects were delayed or cancelled. The outlook among contractors remained   unchanged since last reported, with most anticipating activity to continue to   decline into 2010. However, contractors in some parts of the District noted that   federal stimulus monies were starting to help spur some public-sector   activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A small majority of   manufacturing contacts noted moderate declines in orders and production during   September. In addition, four-fifths of our contacts reported similar or   declining levels of finished inventories relative to the previous month, and   most reported that they were operating well below capacity. The outlook for   production remained modestly positive, with forty percent of contacts expecting   to increase output and another forty percent anticipating that current levels of   activity would remain the same over the next three to six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, transportation activity remained weak, with rail shipments of   automobiles being one of the few areas showing improvement. Weak demand and   lower prices were noted as adversely impacting revenues for several regional   trucking companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District banking reports cited that   lending conditions remained tight. Real estate contacts mentioned that   homebuyers had difficulty securing financing for non-conforming mortgages. Some   retailers indicated that obtaining inventory financing was harder. Commercial   contractors noted that tight lending conditions had restrained commercial   development.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District businesses noted that the   pace of layoffs slowed in September, but there continued to be concerns over   hiring as few contacts reported any plans to increase payrolls. Many employers   indicated that they were holding on to the most skilled workers, but have   reduced overall hours. They feel that a sustained increase in orders and sales   is a prerequisite to adding to payrolls. There were several reports of firms   that were substituting some of their payroll employees with contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction and manufacturing firms reported that several raw material   prices continued to moderate. Real estate contacts noted some further downward   pressure on rents. Once again, most retailers remarked that retail prices   remained stable relative to year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District contacts   indicated that with petroleum and refined product inventories well above average   levels, refining margins continued to deteriorate in September. As a result,   refiners have cut back on processing, delayed new projects, and have shut down   for lengthy maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unusually high rainfall amounts were reported in most parts of the District.   Floods damaged some of North Georgia's nurseries, vegetable farms, and   commercial vineyards. However, Florida citrus growers benefited from recent   rainfall. Crop conditions were described as generally favorable for cotton,   soybeans, and peanuts in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.
