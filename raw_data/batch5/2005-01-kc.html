      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       January 19, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded solidly in the period from late November 

  to early January. Holiday retail sales were favorable, factory activity strengthened, 

  and labor markets improved further. The energy and agriculture sectors also 

  remained strong. Housing activity slowed slightly but was still high by historical 

  standards, while commercial real estate markets generally remained weak. Wage 

  and retail price pressures were still modest, but some price pressures persisted 

  in manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending during the holiday season was generally characterized as solid. 

  Most store and mall managers reported favorable year-over-year increases in 

  holiday sales, with sales above plan at many stores. Overall, store managers 

  reported that price discounting was similar to a year ago, although a few contacts 

  said they resorted to heavy promotions to boost sales around Christmas. Sales 

  of jewelry, other high-end items, and electronics were reported as especially 

  strong this year. Many gift and specialty stores also reported robust sales. 

  Apparel sales were somewhat mixed, with some stores reporting sluggish sales 

  of winter clothing items due to unseasonably warm temperatures in early December. 

  Inventory levels following the holidays were generally reported as satisfactory. 

  Virtually all managers expect solid year-over-year sales gains in the near future, 

  due in part to greater holiday sales of gift cards than a year ago. Motor vehicle 

  sales in the district were reported as up slightly from the fall but basically 

  unchanged from a year earlier. Most dealers were satisfied with current inventory 

  levels and expect solid sales growth in coming months. Travel and tourism activity 

  during the holidays rose solidly from a year ago. Airport traffic increased 

  in most district cities, and activity at the Rocky Mountain ski resorts was 

  strong, with some resorts reporting near-record levels of visitors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity strengthened further. Most manufacturers reported 

  increased production and orders since the previous survey, and employment continued 

  to expand at many firms. A number of manufacturers continued to report difficulties 

  obtaining materials, especially petroleum-based inputs, and expect some modest 

  material availability problems to persist. Plant managers' expectations for 

  future production remained strong, and many firms plan to continue to expand 

  employment heading forward. In addition, many manufacturers expect to increase 

  their capital spending in 2005, both to replace outdated equipment and to expand 

  capacity. Among those firms not planning increases in capital spending, a commonly 

  cited reason was the recent completion of a major capital project.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing activity slowed slightly but remained solid, while commercial real estate 

  activity was still weak in most areas. Single-family housing starts edged down 

  in many district cities but were still above last year's high levels. Builders 

  generally characterized starts of both low-end and high-end homes as solid. 

  Most builders expect some continued easing in homebuilding in the months ahead, 

  though construction activity is expected to remain high by historical standards. 

  Based on reports from real estate agents, home sales compared with recent months 

  were basically flat for the district as a whole, with some cities reporting 

  increases and others reporting decreases. Compared to last year's high levels, 

  home sales were reported as being flat to slightly higher in most areas. Most 

  mortgage lenders reported a decline in mortgage demand since the previous survey. 

  Some lenders also noted a shift away from variable rate loans. Lenders generally 

  expect some decrease in mortgage demand in the months ahead due to an anticipated 

  further easing in demand for refinancings. Commercial real estate activity in 

  the district generally remained weak, though some small improvements were reported 

  in several mid-sized markets. Office vacancy rates edged down except in Denver 

  and Kansas City, and prices for office space rose slightly in most areas as 

  well. Most commercial real estate agents expect little significant change in 

  office conditions in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers report that loans and deposits both edged up since the last survey, 

  leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand rose for commercial and industrial 

  loans but was generally unchanged for other loan categories. On the deposit 

  side, large CDs rose, while other types of accounts held steady. All respondent 

  banks raised their prime lending rates since the last survey, and most banks 

  also raised their consumer lending rates. Lending standards were generally unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity remained strong. The count of active oil and gas drilling 

  rigs in the region was basically unchanged from the previous survey and still 

  well above year-ago levels. Some contacts reported continued constraints on 

  drilling due to labor and equipment shortages. With oil and gas prices still 

  high, most drilling companies expect a slight expansion in drilling in the months 

  ahead and are planning for solid increases in capital spending in 2005. Coal-mining 

  firms also reported strong output growth in 2004 and anticipate another solid 

  year in 2005.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions generally remained strong. The winter wheat 

  crop was reported to be in good condition across the district. In addition, 

  preliminary assessments of farm incomes for 2004 indicate they will be up slightly 

  from the record highs of 2003. Despite the higher incomes, few contacts expect 

  large increases in capital investment this year because many producers made 

  such investments last year. In addition, some producers in western parts of 

  the district are worried that a possible lack of spring moisture could worsen 

  already dry pasture conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wage and retail price pressures remained modest, while price pressures persisted 

  in manufacturing. Labor markets continued to show improvement, as hiring announcements 

  again outpaced layoffs. Even so, the percentage of firms reporting difficulties 

  finding qualified workers remained similar to recent surveys--up considerably 

  from a year ago but still much lower than five years ago. Worker shortages continued 

  to be most acute in the energy sector, with one driller hiring rig workers from 

  overseas in order to expand. Skilled factory workers, such as welders and metal 

  fabricators, were also reported to be in short supply at some plants. Aside 

  from these positions, wage pressures were still generally modest across the 

  district. Most retailers reported flat selling prices compared with the previous 

  survey and said that holiday discounting was similar to a year ago. Heading 

  forward, a few retailers expect to raise prices modestly in order to pass on 

  vendor price increases, but most managers anticipate little change in selling 

  prices. Builders again reported moderate input price increases, though the increases 

  were less widespread than in previous surveys. They generally anticipate further 

  slight price increases heading forward. Many manufacturers continued to report 

  rising materials costs, though fewer firms than in recent surveys did so. At 

  the same time, a slightly higher percentage of factories raised their output 

  prices or expect to do so in the near future.
