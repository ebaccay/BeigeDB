      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 1, 2004
      </strong>
      <p>
       The Ninth District experienced broad-based growth from October through mid-November. 

  Signs of growth were noted in most areas: consumer spending, manufacturing, 

  construction, energy, mining and agriculture. Tourism was about even with a 

  year ago. Labor markets tightened and wage increases were modest. Price increases 

  appeared in a number of sectors including manufacturing, construction and energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Overall consumer spending increased from a year ago. A major Minneapolis-based 

  retailer reported same-store sales up 6 percent in October compared with a year 

  ago, while a Minnesota-based women's apparel chain reported October same-store 

  sales up 7 percent compared with last year. A mall manager in Montana reported 

  sales up about 3 percent compared with a year ago; foot traffic picked up in 

  the first half of November. A Minneapolis area mall manager expects a 4 percent 

  to 5 percent increase in holiday sales compared with last year. A South Dakota 

  bank director said most businesses are optimistic for holiday sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       An auto dealer in Minnesota reported that October was generally slow for traffic 

  and sales compared with a year ago; November started a little stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Autumn tourism activity was about even with a year ago. The number of visitors 

  at tourism destinations in the Black Hills of South Dakota during September 

  and October was down slightly compared with a year ago; however, revenue was 

  up slightly. Fall outdoor activities were strong in northwestern Wisconsin, 

  although retail sales slowed somewhat, according to a chamber of commerce representative.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity increased. Based on preliminary results from the Minneapolis 

  Fed's annual business poll (November), respondents from the manufacturing sector 

  expect strong growth in company sales, employment and investment in 2005. In 

  addition, an October survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, 

  Neb.) indicated strong manufacturing activity in the Dakotas and Minnesota. 

  A cabinet producer in Minnesota plans to add a warehouse and a finishing facility. 

  In South Dakota, a snowplow maker expanded production. A large North Dakota 

  bakery plans to add $2 million in processing equipment. In northwestern Wisconsin, 

  a food processor is planning to add a production facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Signs of growth were noted in commercial construction and real estate. In the 

  Minneapolis-St. Paul area, a large commercial real estate firm recently reported 

  increased absorption and decreased vacancy rates for office space. The medical 

  office market is heating up. The industrial real estate market continues to 

  improve throughout the district. Construction began on a $42 million beef processing 

  plant in South Dakota. Contracts awarded for large construction projects in 

  Minnesota and the Dakotas increased 17 percent for the three-month period ended 

  in September compared with a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential markets continued at a strong pace. A mortgage broker in Fargo-Moorhead 

  reported she expects another record year. Despite some small corrections in 

  the Minneapolis-St. Paul area--longer market times, higher inventory and fewer 

  closings--sales continue at a strong pace. A Minnesota bank director noted residential 

  construction was strong, with a mixed outlook. However, realtors in the Duluth-Superior 

  area noted movements toward a buyer's market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy and Mining
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Activity in the energy sectors remained strong, and mining activity increased. 

  Mid-November district oil production increased from early October. A Montana 

  gas exploration and pipeline company is having trouble finding qualified workers, 

  and another gas exploration company plans to increase the number of wells drilled. 

  Iron ore mines continued to produce at capacity. In addition, capital expansion 

  is under way. In Montana, a bank director noted that mining companies are investing 

  in capital equipment and are becoming more aggressive in production and expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agriculture activity increased. "Steadily going up," wrote a Montana lender 

  responding to the Minneapolis Fed's third quarter (October) agricultural credit 

  conditions survey. Lenders expected that overall agricultural income would rise 

  in the fourth quarter. The U.S. Department of Agriculture increased estimates 

  of the already high forecast for the corn harvest, and the soybean harvest is 

  expected to be above last year's levels. The Montana winter wheat crop has emerged 

  at a slightly faster pace than the five-year average. Meanwhile, the USDA forecasts 

  slight decreases in prices for corn and soybeans and a slight increase in wheat 

  prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment, Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Labor market conditions showed some signs of tightening since the last report. 

  A major Minnesota-based airline may recall as many as 400 pilots next year due 

  to attrition and modest growth. A North Dakota window plant recently announced 

  the addition of 40 new jobs. Retail hiring is generally expected to be above 

  year-ago levels at district retail stores. Montana and South Dakota business 

  contacts mentioned some difficulty in finding qualified workers, especially 

  skilled workers and in hiring for night and weekend shifts. Just over 44 percent 

  of preliminary respondents to the Minneapolis Fed's business poll expect to 

  increase employment at their companies; 49 percent expect to keep staffing levels 

  the same. A year ago the poll responses were 33 percent and 52 percent, respectively.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, a Minnesota-based company that makes recordable tape, CD and DVD 

  products plans to cut 250 jobs companywide, with many of the layoffs taking 

  place at its headquarters. The closing of a Minnesota call center, due to company 

  consolidation, will affect 70 jobs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increases in wages and salaries were modest. Bank directors in Montana mentioned 

  moderate increases in wages and salaries in several parts of the state. Wage 

  and salary growth in 2005 is expected to be subdued; 78 percent of respondents 

  to the Minneapolis Fed's business poll expect wage increases to range from 2 

  percent to 3 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Price increases appeared in several sectors, including manufacturing, construction 

  and energy. Preliminary results of the Minneapolis Fed's business poll indicate 

  some higher expectations for prices, as 48 percent of respondents expect to 

  increase prices for their products in 2005, up from 31 percent in last year's 

  poll. Several construction and manufacturing materials prices increased, such 

  as aluminum, concrete, copper, diesel fuel and steel products. Softwood prices 

  decreased since the last report, but were still about 15 percent higher than 

  a year ago. Pork prices were up about 15 percent from last year.
