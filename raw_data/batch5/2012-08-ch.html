      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh District expanded at a moderate pace in July   and early August, with the pace of growth once again slowing from the prior   reporting period. Contacts reported heightened concern regarding the risks to   the economic outlook, notably the U.S. fiscal situation and weaker growth in   Europe and Asia. Business spending increased at a slower pace, while consumer   spending growth picked up some. Growth in manufacturing production moderated   further, while construction activity continued to slowly increase. Credit   conditions were again slightly improved. Smaller anticipated corn and soybean   harvests due to the ongoing drought pushed crop prices higher and raised the   cost of feeding livestock, with some pass-through to wholesale prices already   taking place.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The pace of growth in consumer spending   increased slightly in July and early August due in large part to heavy   discounting by retailers to clear inventory space for back-to-school items.   Store traffic was similar to last year at this time; however, retail contacts   noted that the recent increases in gas prices were leading to less discretionary   spending. Sales of summer clothing and other seasonal items remained strong.   Sales of big-ticket items such as furniture again were weak, although sales of   electronics improved some. Auto sales were little changed from the prior   reporting period and dealers reported that inventories were beginning to creep   up.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Growth in business spending slowed from   the prior reporting period. Inventories were generally reported to be at   comfortable levels. However, retailers remained cautious in their back-to-school   and holiday season ordering and manufacturers also expressed a desire to tightly   manage their inventories. Capital expenditures on software and equipment were   proceeding as planned, but contacts cited a greater degree of restraint in new   spending projects. Labor market conditions were little changed on balance.   Hiring remained selective in most industries, with demand comparatively stronger   for skilled manufacturing and construction workers, information technology   specialists, and engineers. Several manufacturers reported transitioning   temporary employees into permanent positions, and a staffing firm reported an   increase in demand from the manufacturing sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Construction activity   continued to increase at a slow but steady pace in July and early August.   Multi-family construction remained an area of strength, and residential   single-family construction increased slightly. Homebuilders noted that credit   was still tight for residential projects, with lenders continuing to require   large equity commitments before extending financing. Demand for nonresidential   construction also continued to gradually increase. Industrial building and   highway projects rose further. Elevated office and retail vacancy rates remained   a drag on new commercial construction, but contacts indicated that demand for   office space was slowly improving. That said, a commercial real estate broker   noted that companies lack the confidence to make long-term real estate   commitments, as many continue to negotiate for contracts with opt-out provisions   after two to three years into their lease agreements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Growth in manufacturing production slowed   further over the course of July and early August, with contacts expecting this   slower rate of growth to persist throughout the second half of the year. In the   steel industry, capacity utilization fluctuated some during the reporting   period, but was roughly unchanged on balance. Metals manufacturers noted   continued volatility in their customers' orders, as many were closely monitoring   their inventory levels. The auto industry continued to be a source of strength   for manufacturing. Demand for heavy equipment also remained solid, with rental   fleets continuing to expand. Manufacturers of household goods and building   materials reported that activity had picked up some, although it remained at low   levels. The coal mining industry, however, was a notable exception, as the low   price of natural gas has resulted in the substitution of natural gas for coal in   electricity production. Exporters noted weaker demand from Europe and Asia, but   continued strength from other parts of the world like Mexico.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Credit conditions gradually improved   over the reporting period. Credit spreads and volatility moved lower and   increased competition led to downward pricing pressure on small business loans.   Business loan demand continued to be mostly from small and middle market firms   and for the purpose of refinancing existing debt as opposed to financing capital   expenditures. Banking contacts reported that many of their customers are waiting   to assess the impact of the upcoming election on tax and healthcare policies.   Consumer loan demand was steady. Mortgage refinancing continued to increase and   contacts noted the greater availability of sub-prime loans for used autos. With   overall loan growth flattening out in recent months, a banking industry contact   noted that some banks are investing in municipal bonds as a way to increase   their earnings.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Cost pressures were mixed in July and   early August. Prices fell for a number of commodities but rose for materials   like steel and lumber. Gasoline prices moved higher and shipping costs were also   noted to have risen. Retailers reported that the spike in agricultural commodity   prices resulting from the drought, particularly its impact on higher feed costs,   was already starting to be passed through to wholesale prices. Wage pressures   continued to be moderate, although several contacts cited upward pressure on   healthcare costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      The drought has substantially reduced   expected yields for corn and soybeans, although the impact varied considerably   across the District. Scattered rains near the end of the reporting period helped   revive soybeans to some degree; however, with the exception of some   late-plantings, the precipitation was too late to improve yields for most of the   corn crop. Crop insurance and higher prices will partially offset lost revenue.   However, some farmers face the prospect of having to buy corn at market prices   after selling ahead more than they will likely harvest. Livestock pastures are   in poor shape as well, and fields with low corn yields were being chopped for   silage to feed livestock. With feed costs high, livestock operations cannot   cover their costs of production, and operators have reduced their herds   accordingly. Hog and cattle prices were down from the prior reporting period,   while dairy prices were up as milk production dipped.
