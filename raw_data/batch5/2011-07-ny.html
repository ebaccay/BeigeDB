      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 27, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The pace of activity in the Second District's economy slowed somewhat since   the last report. Business contacts across a variety of sectors indicate that   activity has flattened out in recent weeks and that hiring has tapered off.   Retail sales remained fairly sturdy in June but were mixed in early July.   Consumer confidence has remained at low levels. Tourism activity has remained   strong. Commercial real estate markets have been mixed since the last report,   with office markets mostly stable but industrial markets weakening somewhat. The   residential purchase market has been steady to somewhat softer, while the rental   market has shown further signs of strengthening; there continues to be little   new home construction. Finally, bankers report increased demand for commercial   and industrial loans, lower delinquency rates on such loans, and no change in   credit standards in any category.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Non-auto retail sales continued to run   on or above plan in June, with same-store sales running 1 to 5 percent ahead of   a year earlier, though reports for early July were more mixed. A number of   contacts note that sales of apparel have been performing relatively well, while   sales of home goods have been on the sluggish side; one contact notes that   fashion apparel has been selling considerably better than more basic items. One   large chain reports somewhat stronger sales in its New York City stores than   elsewhere in the region; part of this is attributed to tourism. Moreover, one   large retail mall in western New York State notes that a continued brisk flow of   Canadian shoppers has been a major factor in driving sales. Retail inventories   are generally reported to be in good shape. Prices appear to be relatively   stable overall: one retail chain indicates that it has raised prices moderately   on some lines, but another contact notes that there is somewhat more discounting   of merchandise than at this time last year. Sharply higher cotton prices are   expected to push up clothing prices moderately in the second half of the   year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales were mixed in June.   Rochester-area dealers note some deceleration in sales, mainly attributed to low   inventories or stock-outs due to ongoing Japan-related disruptions. On the other   hand, Buffalo-area dealers indicate some pickup in sales in June, after a   sluggish May, as inventory problems begin to subside. Used cars are said to be   selling well. Auto-industry contacts note improvement in both retail and   wholesale credit conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer confidence surveys continue to give mixed results. Siena College   reports that consumer confidence among NY State residents slipped in June,   following a good gain in May, with declines occurring both upstate and   downstate. In contrast, the Conference Board reports that consumer confidence   among residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ, Pa) rose in June,   following a steep drop in May. Still, both surveys show confidence mired at low   levels. Tourism activity in New York City has remained quite strong since the   last report, as reflected in persistently high hotel occupancy rates, room rates   that run 6 to 8 percent ahead of a year earlier, and a pickup in Broadway   theatre attendance and revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential construction has   remained depressed and housing markets across the District have remained   sluggish since the last report, although there has been further improvement in   the rental market. An authority on New Jersey's housing industry reports that   the resale market has remained weak, and that the level of optimism appears to   have waned. Prices of existing homes have continued to drift down, largely   reflecting a preponderance of "distressed" sales; otherwise, prices across   northern New Jersey are generally flat. While the inventory of unsold new homes   is fairly lean now, the inventory of available existing homes remains   elevated--as high as 16 months of sales if units in foreclosure and other   distressed properties are included. Buffalo-area Realtors also report some   weakening in market conditions in May and June; while foot traffic has been   fairly brisk, few people have made offers. More generally, sales activity across   New York State has been steady to weaker. A major New York City appraisal firm   reports that both sales and prices of co-ops, condos, and single-family homes   remain flat overall--both in Manhattan and in the outer boroughs--with the high   end of the market accounting for a larger share of sales than last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast with the weakness in home purchase markets, rental markets have   shown increasing strength. Manhattan's apartment rental market has strengthened   since the last report. Rents on new leases were reported to be up 6 percent in   June from a year earlier in June. In addition, one contact notes that landlords   have pulled back on concessions, which are now reportedly being offered on fewer   than 5 percent of new leases, down from 60 percent in mid-2010. Separately, the   Jersey shore summer rental market is reported to be fairly strong this year,   though the sales market for rental units remains sluggish. More broadly, many   New Jersey landlords are reported to be pushing through rent increases for the   first time since the recession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial real estate markets have been steady to somewhat weaker since the   last report. Office vacancy rates and rents were generally stable across the   District during the second quarter: market conditions improved slightly in the   Buffalo and Rochester metro areas and in Manhattan, but they weakened moderately   in northern New Jersey and metropolitan Albany. However, industrial real estate   markets weakened modestly across most of the District, with vacancy rates edging   up and rents drifting down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from business contacts   point to some leveling off in the labor market. A major New York City employment   agency reports that recruitment activity has been steady but lackluster since   Memorial Day. Hiring in the legal industry has continued to improve from very   depressed levels, with large firms hiring once again. Financial sector hiring   has been spotty. Still, the flow of applicants for office jobs has declined   somewhat. More broadly, contacts in both the manufacturing sector and other   industries report some tapering off in hiring activity since the last report,   though employment levels are still expected to increase moderately over the   second half of 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at overall business activity, manufacturing firms in the District   report a pause in growth in June and early July, based on the latest Empire   State Manufacturing Survey. Manufacturers also report that price pressures have   eased since the last report and that their selling prices are steady; however,   both prices paid and prices received are expected to increase in the months   ahead. Non-manufacturing firms also indicate that business activity has   flattened out since the last report, and contacts have become somewhat less   optimistic about the near term outlook. Non-manufacturing firms report that cost   pressures remain widespread and more contacts than last time report that they   are raising selling prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Developments
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers indicate increased demand   for commercial and industrial loans but little or no change in other loan   categories. Bankers also reported a moderate decline in the demand for   refinancing. Credit standards were reported to be virtually unchanged for all   loan categories--the first time in a number of years that respondents did not   report net tightening on the commercial and industrial segment. Respondents   report decreases in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan   categories, especially residential mortgages; they also indicate a decrease in   the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers indicate lower delinquency rates on   commercial and industrial loans but little or no change in delinquency rates for   the other categories.
