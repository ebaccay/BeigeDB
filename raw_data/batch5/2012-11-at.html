      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 28, 2012
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Most
       <strong>
       </strong>
       businesses across the Sixth District described economic   activity as increasing marginally in October, and most contacts expect little   change in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers cited mild sales growth, while automobile dealers continued to   experience strong results. Overall, tourism activity remained robust.   Residential brokers indicated an increase in existing home sales and prices,   while homebuilders signaled sales were flat to slightly up. Multifamily   development continued to dominate the commercial real estate market.   Manufacturing activity softened as new orders, production, and employment levels   decelerated. Bankers noted that overall loan demand had picked up slightly. On   net, payrolls continued to expand at a modest pace, and price pressures remained   in check for most businesses in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
        <br/>
       </strong>
       District contacts indicated   demand and sales were up slightly in October compared with September. Most   retailers felt that consumer confidence is improving as they head into the   holiday season, which led to expectations that sales would improve over last   year's results. Retailers anticipate a healthy holiday season and most shared   plans to hire the same amount of seasonal staff compared with last year,   although there were some contacts that anticipate hiring a bit more help over   the holidays than they did in 2011. Automobile dealers continued to report   strong sales growth, albeit a bit less robust than earlier in the year. Low   interest rates, aging vehicles, available credit, and the popularity of new   fuel-efficient models were factors cited as driving growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travel and tourism activity remained strong for all sectors except cruise   lines, which continued to underperform against projections made earlier in the   year. Hotel occupancy and room rates were up in most areas, resulting in   increased revenue per available room. International visitors continued to   bolster activity in Florida. Convention bookings were also up over year-ago   levels in most major District cities. The general consensus among hospitality   contacts is that the sector is performing well, and that trend is expected to   continue into 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
        <br/>
       </strong>
       District residential brokers   indicated that recent existing home sales were up slightly compared with   year-earlier levels. Brokers reported that current home owners accounted for the   largest share of home buyers in the District, while investors and first-time   home buyers both were about a quarter of the market, respectively. Reports cited   that investors were more active in Florida compared with other parts of the   District. Most brokers again noted declining inventories and rising home prices.   The outlook for sales among brokers remained positive. Most expect sales growth   to be flat to slightly positive on a year-over-year basis in the short term.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from District homebuilders remained positive as well. While recent   new home sales were only flat to slightly up from a year earlier, the majority   of builders reported that new home inventories were below the year-earlier level   and prices were slightly up compared with a year earlier. In addition, contacts   reported robust buyer traffic in October. In spite of reports of challenges to   obtaining development and construction financing, the outlook for construction   activity remained strong and most builders were looking forward to additional   increases in new home sales in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apartment development continued to dominate the District's commercial real   estate market. Multifamily rent growth remained positive but had slowed somewhat   in recent months in many parts of the region. Contacts indicated that most   office, industrial, and retail markets in the District experienced modest   positive absorption of space during the third quarter. Contractors continued to   expect modest gains in commercial construction activity in 2013.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Transportation
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Manufacturing activity   in the Southeast softened in October. Contacts in the region reported that new   orders, production, and employment levels decelerated. Finished inventory levels   were flat. Auto and auto parts producers experienced slightly softer orders,   resulting in somewhat lower output after several months of very strong demand.   Other durable goods contacts experienced modest growth, especially those tied to   the improving housing market. Energy-related manufacturers continued to report   robust activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rail contacts reported that domestic coal shipments were down because of   softening global demand for metallurgical coal and less demand for coal to fire   domestic utility plants as electricity producers shifted to natural gas.   However, there have been increased movements of crude oil via rail. Ports   experienced weaker container volumes, but slight increases in the level of   break-bulk volumes. Truck freight activity was described as similar to year-ago   levels. Increased fuel costs remained a significant concern for ocean carriers,   but most other industries have been able to pass along increases. Reports   indicated that there appears to have been a shift in the holiday shipping   timeframe, representing a "just-in-time" approach to ordering as retailers   maintain tight inventories as the shopping season approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Small business loan demand increased   slightly in some areas, but many firms remained hesitant to borrow, citing   economic and political uncertainty as a drawback. Competition for high quality   borrowers remained fierce among banks. Banks experienced some residential loan   growth from refinancing activity. Some contacts in the District reported an   increase in demand for construction loans and noted a slight increase in lending   levels compared with last year. Regulatory compliance was cited as adding an   additional burden by many community bankers, which hampered their ability to   originate loans. Some contacts reported underwriting standards had become more   restrictive and burdensome for borrowers since the last report, in terms of both   credit scores and information requests.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment and Prices
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Employment conditions across the   District continued to improve, albeit at a modest pace, in October. Auto- and   energy-related firms reported additional hiring, as did some firms tied to   residential construction. On the services side, accounting, and healthcare firms   were the most positive. Employment agencies reported a pickup in orders for   temporary help. Along those lines, some large employers announced plans to move   towards hiring more part-time versus full-time employees. Firms also reported   that they continued to receive a large number of applications for most   newly-posted positions, causing wages to remain flat. That said, we continued to   hear reports of some higher skilled positions going unfilled because of a lack   of qualified applicants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Controlling costs remained a central theme for businesses in the District as   they were challenged by higher energy and crop-related input prices along with   rising healthcare costs. However, most firms throughout the region noted that   the pressure from overall input prices had eased over the last several months.   Contacts also noted that the relative weakness in natural gas prices had helped   to keep costs in check, particularly for more electricity-intensive firms.   Results from our October Business Inflation Expectations survey indicated that   unit costs were up 1.4 percent over the past 12 months--with manufacturers   experiencing a bit more cost pressures over the last year than service-providing   companies. Looking forward, business expectations for unit cost increases over   the next year have been stable, varying between 1.7 and 1.9 percent over the   past six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Natural Resources and Agriculture
        <br/>
       </strong>
       Hurricane Sandy's   damage to refineries and infrastructure in the Northeast caused southeastern   regional refiners to increase production and transportation of oil products to   affected areas. Natural gas prices and rig counts decreased switching focus to   higher priced oil commodities. Contacts noted inexpensive domestic natural gas   prompted downstream manufacturers to relocate foreign operations to the United   States, prioritizing locations near refining operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much of Georgia continued to experience varying degrees of drought   conditions, while the rest of the region enjoyed normal conditions. Some   agriculture contacts reported labor shortages. Compared with last year, prices   paid to farmers for grain corn, rice, soybeans, beef, and broilers were up while   cotton prices were down.
