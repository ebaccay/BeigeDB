      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to expand modestly during   the reporting period of mid-July through the end of August. Upward price   pressures were mixed but appeared to ease overall, and upward pressures on wages   were subdued. Demand for retail items edged up on balance, as did demand for   business and consumer services. Manufacturing activity in the District grew a   bit further. Demand remained robust for agricultural producers but fell slightly   for providers of energy resources. Activity in District housing markets stayed   sluggish, and demand for commercial real estate was largely unchanged. District   banking contacts indicated that overall loan demand was stable or inched   down.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Wages and Prices
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Upward price pressures were very limited   on net during the reporting period. Further modest price declines were noted for   energy inputs and some raw materials. Stiff competition among domestic firms,   combined with weak final demand, resulted in largely stable prices for most   categories of final goods and services. The primary reported exceptions were   clothing and medical care, for which recent cost increases were passed through   to final prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upward wage pressures were largely nonexistent, as compensation gains were   held down by high levels of unemployment and limited demand for new hires. As a   result of uncertain product demand, businesses in most sectors expect to remain   highly cautious in regard to hiring for the foreseeable future, suggesting that   compensation pressures are likely to remain subdued. However, contacts continued   to report significant upward wage pressures for workers with advanced skills in   technology fields.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail Trade and Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Retail sales were mixed but   rose a bit overall. For general merchandise such as apparel and smaller   household items, contacts reported modest improvements in sales, with stronger   performance for traditional department stores than for discount chains. By   contrast, retailers of major appliances and furniture reported weaker demand   resulting from a renewed sense of caution on the part of consumers. Grocery   sales were largely flat. Sales of new automobiles improved somewhat, despite   ongoing shortages of parts and assembled vehicles for some brands arising from   the natural disaster in Japan earlier this year. The demand for used vehicles   continued to firm, with contacts noting rising sales and additional upward   pressure on prices and trade-in values.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for business and consumer services continued to strengthen overall.   Sales expanded further for providers of technology services, as consumer demand   for software, e-books, and mobile applications continued to grow. Providers of   professional services such as law and accounting reported that demand was little   changed from the prior period. Similarly, demand for transportation services was   characterized as largely flat. For energy utilities, demand waned a bit during   the beginning of the reporting period but improved later. Providers of   health-care services reported that demand strengthened somewhat. Conditions in   the District's travel and tourism industry improved further, with demand growth   reported for the business and tourism segments alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        District manufacturing activity was mixed   but appeared to grow slightly during the reporting period of mid-July through   the end of August. Although manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology   products reported slower growth for new orders and sales, capacity utilization   rates remained high and inventories were near desired levels given the pace of   sales. For makers of commercial aircraft, significant increases in new orders   for narrow-body aircraft combined with an existing order backlog to keep   production rates near capacity. A metal fabricator noted that sales were "steady   but slow"and raw materials were readily available. Petroleum refiners reported   slightly weaker demand and capacity utilization rates that were largely stable,   causing product inventories to rise somewhat. Demand held at very low levels for   manufacturers of wood products.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Demand grew   further for agricultural products and metals but was down slightly for natural   resources used for energy production. Orders and sales continued to expand for a   wide variety of crop and livestock products, especially cattle and cotton.   Contacts noted that agricultural input costs have stabilized following   significant increases in the spring. Rising sales prices for assorted metals   spurred further increases in mining activity in parts of the District. Overall   demand for crude oil weakened a bit, primarily reflecting weaker domestic   demand, but extraction activity for natural gas was largely unchanged.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Demand for housing and for   commercial real estate was little changed from existing low levels. Although the   reports pointed to scattered signs of improvement in the entry-level and   high-end segments of the District's housing markets, the pace of home sales and   construction remained depressed. By contrast, demand for rental space continued   to grow, enabling landlords to increase rents and scale back tenant concessions   in some areas. Demand for commercial real estate remained weak overall, and   vacancy rates for office and industrial space stayed elevated throughout the   District. Conditions were mixed across geographic markets, with deterioration in   leasing activity for some areas contrasting with ongoing improvements in areas   that have benefited from growth in the technology sector, such as the San   Francisco Bay Area and Seattle.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Financial Institutions
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand was largely stable to marginally down   compared with the prior reporting period. Citing heightened levels of   uncertainty, some businesses showed a reduced desire to engage in expansionary   capital spending, reportedly causing demand for commercial and industrial loans   to weaken slightly. Contacts in most sectors reported downward revisions to   their expectations for growth in their industry for the remainder of the year,   suggesting that capital spending will remain muted in coming months. On the   consumer side, loan demand was largely unchanged. While lending standards   remained relatively restrictive for business and consumer loans, the reports   pointed to ongoing improvements in overall credit quality and some loosening of   credit standards for selected borrowers.
