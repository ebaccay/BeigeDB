      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 13, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in most sectors continued to expand during February and   March in the First District, although retail reports are somewhat mixed and real   estate markets report little improvement. Manufacturers cite ongoing revenue   gains, some quite strong, although they also voice increased uncertainty about   the outlook. Most consulting and advertising firms report strong year-over-year   growth in the first quarter. Retailers and manufacturers continue to fill vacant   positions but say they are doing only modest net hiring; consulting and   advertising contacts intend to add to headcounts but are uncertain about skilled   labor supply. Retailers and manufacturers cite commodity cost pressures and some   are raising their selling prices to pass cost increases along to their   customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retailers report mixed sales   results for the period from January through early March, with comparable   same-store sales ranging from modest decreases to mid-single-digit increases.   Several respondents note the negative impact that inclement weather had on   sales. Sales of apparel, accessories, groceries, and home furnishings are   strong, as the consumer continues to seek value.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels are mixed, but retailers say they are working to manage them   carefully. Contacts note price increases for commodities, including cotton,   dairy, grains, meat, produce, and nuts; several express concern about likely   future cost increases. Shipping costs are said to be increasing, attributable to   rising oil prices. Selling prices are mixed, with some contacts holding prices   steady and others passing cost increases along to customers. Headcount is   increasing in line with new store openings and select hiring opportunities.   Capital spending is mixed. Outlooks range from cautious to cautiously   optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Business is good   overall at most responding manufacturers. One firm in the chemical business   reports that sales are skyrocketing and its plants are running at full capacity.   Technology-related manufacturers also report that sales growth continued to be   strong in 2011Q1. Revenue growth varied across different business segments at   more diversified manufacturers, with some sectors such as health care-related   products and transportation seeing rapid sales growth and others experiencing   more moderate increases. By comparison, the climate has softened a bit for a   medical-device producer as well as an electronic-systems manufacturer because of   uncertainty about the federal budget; both firms have a portion of their sales   tied to customers that rely on government contracts and/or grants and that seem   unwilling to spend until the budget uncertainty is resolved. In addition, a   manufacturer heavily tied to residential construction reports a further   deterioration in its business as housing markets remain sluggish. Commodity   prices continue to be a concern for a number of contacted manufacturing firms;   they especially mention price increases for oil, precious metals, corn, and   wheat. Some firms have already raised their selling prices in response to these   input price increases and others plan to do so as the need arises. Companies who   recently raised their prices comment that the increases were accepted easily by   their customers. A food products manufacturer notes that there have been few   objections because their customers are facing price increases from numerous   suppliers. At some firms, these recent price increases do not fully compensate   for their inability to raise prices in prior years. As a result, profits are   flat at one firm despite its robust sales growth, and some other firms are   looking for ways to cut costs further. A number of companies also note rising   transportation costs for their goods due to rising diesel fuel prices. In   addition, firms that use electronic components in their production are somewhat   concerned about supply-chain disruptions in Japan. Inputs from Japan are   expected to be in short supply soon (if they are not already) and the extent to   which Japanese disruptions will impact firms' costs and/or production is   uncertain. Respondent firms' sales exposure in Japan, however, is relatively   limited and the revenue impact of the disaster is expected to be fairly   small.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of technology-related manufacturers plan to hire additional workers   in the coming months, in addition to the workers some of them have already hired   this year. Much of this hiring will be domestic, but not necessarily in New   England. Non-technology manufacturers note limited if any hiring plans. At least   one firm plans to reduce its workforce slightly through restructuring in an   effort to cut costs further, given continued uncertainty in the economic   environment. Nearly all firms, however, mention plans to implement merit-based   salary increases of 1.5 percent to 3 percent. In addition, one firm says it is   planning for a greater merit pool next year to compensate for a few years of low   salary increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, manufacturing firms continue to be cautiously optimistic. They   anticipate growth will continue at a steady pace, but relative to the last round   they voiced somewhat greater uncertainty about the outlook for the rest of 2011.   This change is due to the natural disaster in Japan, the current geopolitical   climate worldwide, and ambiguity about U.S. government spending going   forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Selected Business Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consulting and advertising   contacts in the First District mostly report significant growth in revenue   during the first quarter of 2011. Consulting contacts in particular experienced   large increases in demand, with year-over-year revenue increases ranging from 12   percent to 40 percent. They believe that clients are setting aside larger   portions of their budgets for consulting or advertising services as the impact   of the recession wanes. One exception is an advertising company whose revenue   was down 25 percent from a very strong first quarter of 2010. Contacts have   slightly increased the prices they charge for their services or they plan to do   so over the course of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents plan to augment employment by the end of the year to meet   increased demand. The magnitude of the planned staff-size increases ranges from   3 percent to 12 percent. A number of contacts say they are experiencing   recruiting difficulty because they are looking for highly specialized workers.   One consulting firm also notes that the long work hours that consulting   companies demand may no longer be acceptable to many qualified candidates. Wages   are steady or up slightly, with one consulting firm reporting it has removed   bonus cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our contacts are hopeful regarding their performance in the second quarter   and the rest of 2011. They see the pipeline as very robust and expect   significant year-over-year revenue growth of 10 percent to 20 percent, except   for one advertising company that foresees flat demand. Some contacts note that   unsuccessful recruiting efforts are a risk for these projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England's commercial real   estate market was roughly flat in recent weeks. In Boston, office leasing   activity is stable, but not sufficient to generate significant positive   absorption. Asking rents for office space are either flat or up marginally in   greater Boston. However, contacts note that some existing tenants are   successfully bargaining for rent reductions, bringing their rents down to   current market rates from higher levels agreed upon at the market's peak. In   Rhode Island, political uncertainty over budget deficits is said to have stalled   business plans, resulting in light leasing activity, but pending deals for   downtown Providence continue to engender optimism regarding office absorption in   the coming months. In Portland, the commercial market was mostly quiet, with the   exception of two significant deals for call-center space. A Portland contact   perceives continued downward pressure on office rents despite modest positive   absorption. Outlooks across the region call for slow but positive office   absorption for the remainder of 2011, conditional on ongoing employment growth   in line with recent trends.
     </p>
     <p>
      The multifamily sector remains strong in southern New England, with new   construction under way in several areas of greater Boston and in the planning   stages in two Rhode Island locations. Lenders continue to bid aggressively for   apartment projects in greater Boston, as rental rate increases persist. While   some Boston contacts worry about potential overbuilding in this sector, at least   one is confident that a glut is unlikely in light of permitting hurdles and a   scarcity of vacant land in desirable locations. Respondents mention no   significant new construction activity aside from the multifamily sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      States throughout the region   experienced year-over-year declines in single-family home sales in February with   the exception of New Hampshire where sales increased modestly. The median price   of homes also slipped slightly in the region except for Rhode Island where the   median price rose. Meanwhile, sales and median prices of condominiums were lower   than a year ago except in the Greater Boston area where the median condo price   edged up. Contacts cite inclement weather as a factor contributing to February   sales declines; sellers as well as buyers were discouraged by the weather, with   home listings decreasing as well. Contacts also note that sales in the first   half of 2010 were boosted by the homebuyer tax credit, making year-over-year   comparisons difficult to interpret.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts report a recent increase in activity attributable to more favorable   weather as well as the typical seasonal rise at the onset of spring. Some   respondents say the distressed share of property sales has declined, but others   lacked sufficient figures to assess the distressed property share accurately.   Although inventory levels declined in much of the region during February, the   number of homes on the market remains relatively high across New England,   particularly in New Hampshire. Notwithstanding their reports of recent increases   in activity, contacts emphasize that activity levels in the region's housing   markets remain far from what they would characterize as "normal" and they   anticipate a lengthy recovery.
