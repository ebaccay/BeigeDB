      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Twelfth District appears to  have changed little during the survey period of late April through the end of May.  Upward price pressures were subdued for most  products but remained severe for food and energy-intensive items, while wage  pressures continued to ease in some sectors.  Retail sales were weak and demand growth  slowed for service providers.   Manufacturing activity held steady or grew slightly on net, while  producers of agricultural and natural resource products saw strong sales.  Housing markets remained exceptionally weak  despite scattered reports of improved sales, and demand for commercial real  estate continued to soften in some areas.   Banks and other financial institutions reported that loan demand was  largely unchanged or fell slightly on net, and credit standards tightened  further.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price  inflation was modest for most products but remained high for food and energy-intensive  items.  Final prices for many retail  items were largely stable or down.   However, continued price increases for some commodities and raw materials,  such as steel and copper, are increasingly being passed through to final prices  for various goods.  In addition, many  providers of transportation services have been passing on higher fuel prices  through surcharges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were limited,  with contacts noting only small increases in overall labor costs.  Reports indicated additional easing in wage  pressures in sectors that have seen reduced labor demand, such as construction,  finance, retail, and real estate.   However, wage increases remained rapid for skilled workers in selected  sectors, such as computer services.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales held steady or  softened further, with many respondents pointing to increases 
in food and energy prices as a restraining factor on sales of other  products.  For department stores and many  smaller retail outlets, sales remained at low levels, causing inventories to  rise and resulting in aggressive price discounting.  Demand was firmer for discount chains than  for traditional department stores, and demand for consumer electronic products  remained strong.  Gasoline sales volumes  were below their levels from 12 months earlier and continued to fall during the  survey period.  Demand remained very weak  for new and used vehicles, especially for larger vehicles with low fuel  efficiency, for which sales were described as "dismal."
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand growth for service providers slowed  further on net.  Growth continued at a  moderate pace for providers of health-care services.  Demand weakened for providers of advertising  and professional services, although one contact noted that demand for business  enterprise software has "stabilized" after declining in earlier reporting  periods.  Providers of real estate  services, such as title insurance, faced very low levels of activity and  continued to reduce employment counts.  The  tourism industry saw mixed but somewhat weak performance on net. Hotel bookings  and visitor spending were characterized as weaker or declining in Southern   California and also in Hawaii,  where recent airline bankruptcies reportedly have held down visitor counts; in  contrast, hotel occupancy rates in parts of Alaska  have been at record levels.
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District manufacturing activity  appeared to hold steady or grow slightly on net during the survey period of late  April through the end of May.  New orders  have slowed for makers of commercial aircraft and parts, although production  activity remained at high levels due to existing order backlogs.  Semiconductor manufacturers continued to  report moderate growth in revenues accompanied by balanced inventories and high  rates of capacity utilization.   Manufacturers of heavy equipment saw largely stable demand on net, with strong  sales of farm equipment  noted.  By contrast, makers of wood  products continued to scale back production activity and employment.  Petroleum refiners had been operating at  relatively low utilization rates, but production activity rose recently.  Food manufacturers saw further growth in  output and sales, but high commodity and fuel prices have crimped profit  margins.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand  and sales grew at a strong pace for agricultural items and natural resources.  Domestic and overseas sales remained robust  for a variety of tree and row crops and for livestock, and profits are expected  to be abundant this year despite some offset due to high prices for inputs such  as seeds and fertilizer.  Oil and natural  gas extraction expanded further in response to growing demand, although these  activities reportedly were constrained slightly by tight availability of some  types of equipment and materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Housing markets remained  exceptionally weak during the survey period, while conditions in nonresidential  real estate markets softened a bit further.   Unsold inventories of new and existing homes remained at unusually high  levels in most areas, causing further price drops, especially in parts of California,  Arizona, and Nevada  that also have seen sharp increases in home foreclosures.  Scattered reports pointed to a recent pickup  in home sales, which was attributed to increased affordability due to lower  prices.  On the nonresidential side, conditions  weakened a bit further in some areas, with contacts noting reduced leasing  activity and lower sales prices for commercial properties in the San Francisco  Bay Area and further increases in vacancy rates for commercial property in Las    Vegas and San Diego.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District banking contacts reported  that lending activity was largely flat or fell slightly relative to the  previous survey period.  Reports on  commercial and industrial lending suggested a slight easing overall, with some  contacts reporting weak demand and others reporting little change.  Lenders continued to tighten credit  standards, which remained especially strict for residential mortgages and  construction loans.  Credit quality  eroded a bit further, mainly for loans related to the housing sector, with the  most significant adverse impacts on asset portfolios noted for smaller  community banks.
