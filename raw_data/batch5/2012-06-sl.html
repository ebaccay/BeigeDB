      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Eighth District has continued to grow at a modest pace since   our previous survey. Residential real estate market conditions have improved   moderately. Similarly, commercial real estate market conditions have also   improved. Retail and auto sales in April and early May increased over   year-earlier levels. In contrast, recent reports of plans from firms in the   manufacturing and services sectors were mixed. Reports of lending activity at a   sample of large District banks during the first quarter of 2012 were somewhat   mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in   April and early May were up slightly, on average, over year-earlier levels.   About 60 percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 12 percent   saw decreases and 28 percent saw no changes. Thirty-seven percent of the   retailers noted that sales levels met their expectations, 42 percent reported   that sales were below expectations, and 21 percent reported that sales were   above expectations. Twenty percent of the retailers noted that their inventories   were too high, while 12 percent indicated that their inventories were too low.   The sales outlook for the summer was positive: 56 percent of the retailers   expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while 24 percent expect sales to   decrease and 20 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that sales in April and early May were   up, on average, compared with last year. About 64 percent of the car dealers   surveyed saw increases in sales, while 24 percent saw decreases and 12 percent   saw no changes. Twenty percent of the car dealers noted that new car sales had   increased relative to used car sales, while 20 percent reported the opposite.   Also, roughly 28 percent of contacts reported an increase in sales of low-end   vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while about 12 percent reported the   opposite. Forty percent of the car dealers surveyed reported that their   inventories were too low, while about 8 percent reported that their inventories   were too high. The sales outlook for June and July was optimistic: 88 percent of   the car dealers expect sales to increase over 2011 levels, while just 8 percent   expect sales to decrease and 4 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's   sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports of   plans for manufacturing activity have been mixed since our previous report.   Several manufacturers reported plans to open plants and hire workers, while a   similar number of contacts reported plans to close plants and lay off workers in   the near future. Firms in the paper product, agriculture, chemical, paint, and   military and police equipment manufacturing industries reported plans to   decrease existing operations or close plants in the District. In contrast,   contacts in the automobile parts, wood product, solar panel, and steel product   manufacturing industries reported plans to hire workers and increase operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of planned activity in the District's service sector also have been   mixed since our previous survey. Contacts in air transportation support, travel,   and religious organization services announced plans to lay off workers and   reduce operations in the District. In contrast, firms in software development   services announced plans to hire additional workers and expand operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales increased   throughout most of the Eighth District on a year-over-year basis. Compared with   the same period in 2011, April 2012 year-to-date home sales were up 13 percent   in Louisville, 3 percent in Little Rock, 20 percent in Memphis, and 18 percent   in St. Louis. Residential construction increased in the majority of the District   over this time period. April 2012 year-to-date single-family housing permits   increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same   period in 2011. Permits increased 35 percent in Louisville, 20 percent in Little   Rock, 31 percent in Memphis, and 28 percent in St. Louis.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate conditions have continued to improve   throughout most of the District. Contacts in Louisville reported that the   increase in office real estate activity slowed during April, but overall   performance in the first quarter of 2012 remained strong. A contact in St. Louis   reported strong commercial real estate activity and weak industrial real estate   activity in the first quarter of 2012. Commercial and industrial construction   activity improved moderately throughout most of the District. Contacts in south   central Kentucky noted that new large commercial construction projects have been   undertaken, and a contact in Louisville reported plans for speculative   industrial construction. A contact in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, reported some new   large commercial construction plans. A contact noted a few large industrial   construction plans in Wentzville, Missouri, and some commercial and industrial   construction plans in Jefferson County, while a contact in St. Louis reported   steady commercial construction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks indicated moderate changes in overall lending   activity during the first quarter of 2012. During this period, credit standards   for commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged, while demand for such   loans was moderately stronger. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans   generally remained unchanged. Demand for commercial real estate loans ranged   from unchanged to substantially stronger. Meanwhile, credit standards for   consumer loans ranged from basically unchanged to somewhat eased, while demand   ranged from moderately weaker to moderately stronger. Respondents noted that   credit standards for prime residential mortgage loans remained unchanged, while   demand for these loans ranged from about the same to substantially stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop moisture levels   from April to mid-May were classified as slightly dry to favorably moist in most   of the District except southern Arkansas and most of Mississippi. Rates of   completion for the planting of corn, cotton, rice, sorghum, and soybeans were at   least 15 percentage points higher than their 5-year average rates in most   District states, while crop emergence was also ahead of schedule. More than 88   percent of the winter wheat crop was rated as fair or better, while 77 percent   or more of pasture land was also similarly rated in all District states. The   District's year-to-date coal production for early May was 3.8 percent lower   compared with the same period last year. Similarly, the District's coal   production for April 2012 was 2.6 percent lower than in April 2011.
