      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland based on   information collected on or before November 19, 2010. This document summarizes   comments received from business and other contacts outside the Federal Reserve   and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <hr width="600"/>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that the economy   continued to improve, on balance, during the reporting period from   early/mid-October to mid-November. Economic activity in the Boston, Cleveland,   Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco Districts increased at a slight to modest   pace, while a somewhat stronger pace of economic activity was seen in New York,   Richmond, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Kansas City. Philadelphia and St. Louis   reported business conditions as mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand in almost all Districts, with   relatively strong growth seen in metal fabrication and the automotive   industries. Reports also showed steady to increasing activity for professional   and nonfinancial services. Two Districts noted a decline in demand from   government agencies due to budgetary shortfalls. Reports on consumer spending   tended to be positive. Nonetheless, several Districts noted that households   remain price sensitive and focused on buying necessities. Expectations for the   holiday shopping season were generally positive, with several Districts   expecting higher sales when compared to year-ago levels. Sales of new cars and   light trucks were largely higher than in our last report. Tourism improved in   all reporting Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing markets remain depressed, with several Districts reporting further   weakening during the past six weeks. Conditions in commercial real estate were   mixed, and activity stayed at low levels. Agricultural conditions were generally   favorable, with several Districts reporting yields nearing historic highs.   Agricultural sales to off-shore buyers increased. Overall activity in the energy   sector continued to expand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending activity remained stable across most Districts. Credit quality has   been steady to improving for most of the Districts that commented on it. Prices   for final goods and services were fairly stable, despite rising input costs,   especially for agricultural commodities, metals, and fuel. Hiring activity   showed some improvement across most Districts. Wage pressures were   contained.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity continued to expand   in most Districts. New York was the only District where manufacturing activity   was reported to have weakened, while Dallas reported that manufacturing was   mixed. Metal fabrication increased in Chicago, Kansas City, Dallas, and San   Francisco. Contacts in automotive industries reported gains in Boston,   Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago. The Boston, Kansas City, and San   Francisco Districts reported increased sales for high-technology manufacturers,   though Dallas noted that growth in orders and production in high-technology   industries had slowed from earlier in the year. Steel producers and service   centers in the Cleveland District reported that volume was either flat or   improving, while Chicago noted some temporary softening in steel demand.   Refiners in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts noted reduced production   levels. The Philadelphia and Dallas Districts indicated little improvement in   demand for manufacturers with ties to residential housing and construction. The   Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City Districts reported that capital   spending or spending plans had increased. On net, manufacturers in the St. Louis   District reported they planned to expand operations. Contacts in Boston, New   York, and Richmond commented on increasing input costs. Several Districts noted   an optimistic outlook from manufacturers. Boston and Richmond described   manufacturers as upbeat; New York and Chicago reported contacts as more   optimistic; and Philadelphia and Minneapolis manufacturers expect increases in   activity in the near term. However, several contacts in Dallas expressed concern   about a decline in demand from government agencies, as budget shortfalls   continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity was steady to increasing   for professional and nonfinancial services across most Districts. The exception   was the St. Louis District, which reported a decline in service sector activity.   Boston, Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and San Francisco noted growth in information   technology services. Accounting demand remained stable in the Dallas District,   bolstered by consulting and merger and acquisition work. The healthcare sector   was said to be expanding in reports from Philadelphia and St. Louis, though   Richmond noted no change in demand. Firms that provide services to governments   in the Philadelphia District indicated that their clients were using less of   their services because of the tight budget environment. Demand for   transportation services increased in several Districts. Freight companies in   Cleveland noted that volumes increased slightly during the past six weeks, and   contacts in Atlanta said freight volumes had improved from a year ago, with both   Districts recognizing gains in chemical shipments. Regional rail contacts in   Dallas noted strong increases in volume. Contacts in Dallas said that intermodal   transportation firms experienced increased cargo volumes, buoyed by demand from   international clients, as well as a rise in international container trade   volumes. Kansas City reported that the transportation sector stabilized but   noted a shortage of qualified drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail spending showed   improvement across most Districts, with the exception of Boston, Cleveland,   Richmond and St. Louis, where results were mixed. A return to more seasonably   cool weather was credited for boosting sales in the New York and Dallas   Districts. Grocers reported rising sales in Cleveland and Richmond, while sales   dropped off in San Francisco. Purchases of apparel improved in the Philadelphia,   Chicago, and Dallas Districts. Expectations for the holiday shopping season were   positive across Districts; however, in Richmond, retailers expected holiday   shopping to be restrained. Reports from the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta,   and Chicago Districts indicated that consumers remained value conscious and   tended to focus on buying necessities. Purchases of big ticket items were soft   in Richmond, St. Louis, and Kansas City.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of new automobiles and light trucks rose in nine Districts during the   reporting period, with several Districts indicating that vehicle inventories are   now at appropriate levels. Dealers expect new vehicle sales to continue rising   through year-end in the Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Kansas City Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism was characterized as stronger or improved in the Boston, New York,   Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts, while   business travel to destinations in the New York, Atlanta, and San Francisco   Districts increased. Occupancy rates at hotels in Manhattan and Atlanta's major   markets were higher than a year ago. The Richmond and Atlanta Districts noted a   pickup in international visitors. In Boston, increased tourism was attributed to   generous travel incentives and perceived value, while Richmond noted that   discretionary retail spending by tourists was lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate and   construction activity remained at a low level in all Districts. The   Philadelphia, Atlanta, St. Louis, and Minneapolis Districts reported some   further weakening in home sales. Boston, New York, and Richmond characterized   the market as soft; while Cleveland, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco   described the market as sluggish. The Chicago District reported that high   inventories of unsold homes continued to be a drag on new residential   construction and home prices. Residential house prices were mixed. Price   declines were observed in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Kansas City;   prices were flat to up in Minneapolis, and prices edged up in Boston. The Dallas   District reported that home prices increased on a year-over-year basis. The   rental market continued to offer incentives to tenants in New York, while strong   demand for rental units was reported in Richmond and Dallas. Outlooks for 2011   were mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the commercial real estate industry were mixed during the   reporting period. Several Districts reported flat demand and high vacancy rates,   which translated into limited nonresidential construction activity. The New   York, Atlanta, and Kansas City Districts noted some weakening in nonresidential   activity, while the Boston and Dallas Districts indicated some modest   improvement in commercial real estate. Reports from Cleveland and Chicago noted   that most new projects fell generally into the infrastructure category. Contacts   in Boston, Richmond, Kansas City, and Dallas expressed some optimism about the   near-term outlook in their Districts, but contacts in several other Districts   expressed a more cautious outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking conditions remained stable   across most Districts. Lending activity was reported as steady or unchanged in   New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco, while   a slight improvement was noted in Cleveland, Richmond and Chicago. The Atlanta   District reported constrained credit conditions and weak loan demand. Contacts   in Chicago and Dallas said that increased competition for high-quality borrowers   resulted in more aggressive loan pricing. Demand for commercial and industrial   loans was generally stable, though several Districts noted improvements in   specific loan categories. The Cleveland and Chicago Districts reported increased   lending for mergers and acquisitions, and access to credit by small businesses   in Atlanta improved slightly. Consumer lending has remained stable at weak   levels in most Districts. The San Francisco District reported that loan demand   declined slightly as a result of households' desire to deleverage, while Chicago   saw a small pickup in consumer lending. Several Districts reported increases in   lending related to residential real estate, and, in particular, to refinancing   activity. Reports on changes in credit standards were mixed. Bankers in New York   reported a tightening in credit standards across all loan categories, Kansas   City contacts indicated no change in lending standards, and Atlanta reported an   easing in standards for small firms. Contacts in the Cleveland, Richmond, and   Chicago Districts reported improved credit quality, but San Francisco bankers   noted ongoing struggles with credit quality. The Cleveland and Richmond   Districts both reported declines in delinquencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Mainly favorable   weather conditions helped facilitate early harvesting and the planting of winter   crops. The Chicago, Minneapolis, and Dallas Districts reported large to   record-setting yields for certain crops. Agricultural prices continued to climb,   boosting farm incomes. Reports from several Districts indicated that higher   grain prices were raising feed costs for livestock producers. Nonetheless,   contacts in Chicago noted that even with higher feed costs, margins for   livestock producers remain positive. Strong global demand and tight supplies   pushed cotton prices to near historic highs for growers in Atlanta and Dallas.   San Francisco noted that reductions in overseas yields, combined with the lower   value of the U.S. dollar, are helping boost domestic farm sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the energy sector was expanding. The number of active drilling   rigs increased in the Atlanta, Kansas City, and Dallas Districts. Although   producers are interested in returning to the Gulf of Mexico, drilling remains   well below pre-oil spill levels as permit issuance lags. Producers in Kansas   City expressed concern about future production due to labor and equipment   shortages. Cleveland reported an increase in production from Marcellus shale. In   the Minneapolis District, wind energy continued to expand, but at a slower pace   than a year ago, while mining activity increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Hiring activity showed some improvement   across most Districts, although employers are waiting for clearer signals of   expanding business prospects before adding significantly to payrolls. A   preference for part-time and temporary workers was reported in the Atlanta and   Chicago Districts. Seasonal hiring in retail trade is expected to be higher this   year in Chicago and San Francisco than in the previous two years. Employers in   the Boston, Richmond, and Minneapolis Districts reported having difficulty   finding skilled workers. Employment agencies in the New York, Richmond, and   Chicago Districts reported a moderate increase in new job openings, while   staffing firms in Dallas said that hiring activity is strong. Boston staffing   contacts noted that labor demand has strengthened, particularly in the   information technology, medical, manufacturing, and legal sectors. Wage   pressures remain subdued across Districts. Contacts in Richmond and Kansas City   noted that they expect little change in wage pressures during the upcoming   months. However, employers in San Francisco reported significant increases in   employee benefit costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of final goods and services were fairly stable across Districts   despite rising input costs, especially for agricultural commodities, metals, and   fuel. Companies in the Atlanta, Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco   Districts reported a limited ability to pass through higher input costs to   customers given the relative softness in demand. However, some manufacturers in   the Boston, Cleveland, Atlanta Districts have announced plans to raise their   product prices in the near future. Retailers in Philadelphia and San Francisco   noted price increases on selected products imported from Asian countries.   Reports from the Chicago and Dallas Districts indicated that that record-high   inventories and forecasts for a warmer-than-normal winter are putting downward   pressure on natural gas prices.
