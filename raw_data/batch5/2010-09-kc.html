      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 8, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Growth in the Tenth District economy was modest in late July and August.   Consumer spending increased slightly from the previous period, and high-tech and   transportation firms reported moderate growth. Energy activity continued to   expand solidly, and agricultural conditions improved with higher crop prices.   Manufacturing production was flat, and factory orders declined slightly. The   downturn in commercial real estate eased somewhat, while residential real estate   markets weakened further. Bankers reported steady loan demand and an unchanged   outlook for loan quality. Business contacts were moderately optimistic about   future sales, but few planned to change employment or capital spending levels in   the months ahead. Retail prices were largely unchanged from the previous survey,   and wage pressures in most industries remained limited due to soft labor   markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending rose modestly from   the previous survey, and contacts expected further growth in the months ahead.   Retail sales edged higher and were above year-ago levels at a majority of stores   and malls. Purchases of energy-saving appliances and clearance items were   reported as strong at several stores, while sales of luxury items such as   jewelry and dining room sets were generally characterized as weak. Store   inventories rose somewhat, but most contacts were satisfied with current stock   levels. Auto sales also increased slightly from the previous period, and nearly   all dealers were optimistic about future sales. Auto inventories continued to   decline, and some dealers were concerned about meeting expected demand as a   result. Restaurant sales rose solidly from the previous period, and travel and   tourism activity continued to improve. Several resort contacts in Colorado   anticipated a considerable rebound for the upcoming ski season, following   weakness last winter.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing   activity slowed in late July and August, while other business activity continued   to expand. Factory production was flat compared to previous months, while   shipments and new orders weakened. A producer of chemicals said distributors   were only placing orders for product as needed and were unwilling to bring in   inventory due to high levels of economic uncertainty. Growth in transportation   services moderated slightly from previous surveys but remained solid, and a   major supplier of diesel fuel reported continued solid sales. Most high-tech   services firms reported strong growth in sales, although a few contacts noted   softened demand. Business firms' expectations for future sales eased somewhat   from the previous period but remained positive. Capital spending plans for the   rest of the year remained essentially flat, with most firms citing economic   uncertainty as the primary reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Residential real estate   activity dropped sharply in late July and August, but the downturn in commercial   real estate activity lessened somewhat. Housing starts declined, with several   builders noting continued financing difficulties. Expectations for future   homebuilding remained weak, although one Colorado contact believed a floor   seemed to be forming in that state. Residential construction supply firms also   reported a drop in sales. Home sales plummeted from the previous survey,   especially for higher-priced homes, and home inventories rose across the   District. Real estate agents blamed the steep drop in home sales on expired tax   credits and increased customer uncertainty, and most expected little improvement   in the near future. Mortgage lenders reported that overall mortgage demand   improved slightly from last month, primarily due to a continued rise in   refinancing loans. The downturn in commercial real estate stabilized somewhat in   late July and August, but most contacts expected little improvement in coming   months. Vacancy rates and leasing activity were flat compared to the previous   survey, while construction fell further. Office prices and rents also continued   to decline. Many commercial real estate contacts cited continued financing   difficulties and high economic uncertainty among customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Bankers reported steady loan demand, stable   deposits, and an unchanged outlook for loan quality. Overall loan demand was   little changed after edging up in the previous survey. Demand was also stable in   all major loan categories. As in previous surveys, a few banks tightened   standards on their commercial real estate loans. However, credit standards on   other types of loans were unchanged. Slightly more bankers reported an   improvement in loan quality from one year ago than reported deterioration. Also,   for the third straight survey, respondents expected no change in loan quality   over the next six months. Deposits were flat, continuing the pattern since late   last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Energy activity expanded further in late July and   August. Virtually all contacts reported an increase in drilling activity,   especially for oil, and were optimistic about the months ahead. Crude oil prices   remained relatively profitable, and firms drilling for liquids in western   Oklahoma were reported as operating at full capacity. However, several producers   expressed concerns about low natural gas prices and potentially negative   implications of proposed energy legislation. Natural gas prices eased in August,   and most producers did not expect sizable increases in prices until well into   2011, due to ample supply and average demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Agricultural conditions improved since the   last survey period. The winter wheat harvest finished with above average yields.   The majority of the corn and soybean crops were rated in good or better   condition, though with isolated reports of heat stress, storm damage, and insect   infestation. Crop prices rose on prospects of lower global grain supplies and   Russia's ban on grain exports, boosting farm income expectations. Livestock   prices generally held steady but higher feed costs narrowed profit margins.   Farmland values rose further on strong demand from farm and non-farm buyers and   a limited supply of land for sale during the growing season. However, the   prospect of higher capital gains taxes in 2011 has prompted some farm owners to   consider selling their farms before year-end. Agricultural credit conditions   generally held steady.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer prices were generally unchanged   from the previous survey, and wage pressures in most industries remained   subdued. Several manufacturers reported continued increases in materials prices,   but only a few planned to raise finished goods prices. Construction supply firms   reported declines in selling prices, which they generally expected to continue.   The downward trend in overall retail prices in recent surveys flattened out   slightly, and most contacts expected steady prices heading forward. Services   firms reported no change in the prices charged to customers. Wage pressures were   still contained in most industries, with labor markets remaining soft. However,   some energy firms, auto dealers, and transportation firms reported a slight   uptick in wage pressures due to difficulties finding qualified workers.   Longer-term hiring announcements continued to rise, but near-term hiring plans   generally remained modest.
