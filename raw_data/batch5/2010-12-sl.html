      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      Reports from contacts in the Eighth District have been mixed since our   previous survey. Manufacturing activity has continued to increase, while   activity in the services sector has declined. Retail sales in October and early   November decreased compared with a year ago, while auto sales increased over the   same period. Home sales have declined across the District, while commercial and   industrial real estate market conditions have been mixed. Lending at a sample of   large District banks was mostly unchanged over the three-month period ending in   October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Survey respondents indicated that   retail sales in October and early November were down, on average, over   year-earlier levels. About 54 percent of the retailers saw decreases in sales,   while 42 percent saw increases and 4 percent saw no changes. About 39 percent of   the respondents noted that sales levels met their expectations, 50 percent   reported that sales were below expectations, and 11 percent reported sales were   above expectations. Higher-priced items continued to be weak sellers. About 58   percent of the contacts noted that inventories were at desired levels, while 29   percent reported too-high inventories and 13 percent reported too-low   inventories. The sales outlook among the retailers for the rest of the year was   positive. About 61 percent of the retailers expect sales for the rest of the   year to increase over 2009 levels, while 26 percent expect sales to decrease and   13 percent expect sales to remain unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers reported that sales in October and early November were up, on   average, compared with year-earlier levels. About 54 percent of the car dealers   saw increases in sales, while 29 percent saw decreases and 17 percent saw no   changes. About 29 percent of the car dealers noted that used car sales had   increased relative to new car sales, while 8 percent reported the opposite.   Also, 20 percent reported an increase in low-end vehicle sales relative to   high-end vehicle sales. Roughly 17 percent of contacts reported that their   inventories were too low. A similar number of contacts reported that inventories   were too high. The sales outlook among car dealers for the rest of the year was   also positive. About 58 percent of the car dealers expect sales for the rest of   the year to increase over 2009 levels, but 29 percent expect sales to decrease.   The remaining 13 percent expect sales to be similar to last year's.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several   manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near   future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or   reduce operations. Firms in the boat, sanitary paper product, primary metal,   adhesive, textile, and automobile parts manufacturing industries reported plans   to expand existing operations and hire new employees. Contacts in the plastic   materials and resin, fabricated metal product, automobile parts, and   refrigerator and freezer manufacturing industries reported plans to open new   facilities in the District as well as hire new employees. In contrast, firms in   the wire product, air conditioner, motor, and container manufacturing industries   announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Services sector activity has declined since our previous report. Many   contacts reported plans to decrease operations and lay off workers in the near   future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to open new facilities   and expand operations. Contacts in the architectural, government, education,   gambling, transportation, and hotel services industries reported plans to   decrease operations and lay off workers. Additionally, a firm in the   entertainment industry announced plans to close its facility and lay off   workers. In contrast, contacts in the health care, government, and business   support services industries announced plans to expand existing operations and   hire new employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales declined   throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2009,   September 2010 year-to-date home sales were down 7 percent in St. Louis, 1   percent in Little Rock, and 4 percent in Memphis, but increased 8 percent in   Louisville. September 2010 year-to-date single-family housing permits increased   in the majority of the District metro areas compared with the same period in   2009. Permits increased 14 percent in Little Rock, 10 percent in St. Louis, and   14 percent in Memphis, but decreased 2 percent in Louisville over the same   period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate market conditions throughout the   District continued to be mixed. Compared with the second quarter of 2010,   third-quarter 2010 industrial vacancy rates increased in Little Rock and   Louisville but decreased in Memphis and St. Louis. During the same period,   suburban office vacancy rates increased in Little Rock but decreased in   Louisville and St. Louis. In Memphis, suburban office vacancy rates remained the   same. The downtown office vacancy rates increased in Louisville and Memphis but   decreased in Little Rock and St. Louis. Commercial and industrial construction   was slow across most of the District. Contacts in St. Louis and northeast   Arkansas reported that the pipeline for commercial construction projects is dry.   A contact in south-central Kentucky reported that commercial construction is   stable, but still not at the same level as recent years. A contact in southern   Indiana noted a few industrial development projects. A contact in Louisville   reported that speculative construction remains hampered by the lack of financing   and economic uncertainties.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity   for the three-month period ending in October. Credit standards for commercial   and industrial loans remained basically unchanged, while demand was about the   same. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were also basically   unchanged, while credit standards for residential mortgage loans and consumer   loans ranged from unchanged to tightened somewhat. Meanwhile, demand for   commercial real estate, residential mortgage, and consumer loans all varied   slightly, ranging from moderately weaker to moderately stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lower-than-average   rainfalls and warmer temperatures expedited the completion of the corn, soybean,   sorghum, and cotton harvests in the Eighth District. However, dry conditions   resulted in a 41 percent to 89 percent reduction from last year in the level of   adequate and surplus topsoil moisture levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      By early November, states in the Eighth District had planted at least 13   percent more winter wheat in comparison with the average levels planted by this   time during 2005-09, and at least 70 percent of the current winter wheat crop in   the District was rated in fair or better condition.
