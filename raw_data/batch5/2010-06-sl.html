      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Eighth District has increased modestly since our   previous report. Manufacturing activity increased on balance, while activity in   the services sector was mixed. Retail and auto sales in April and early May   increased over a year ago. Residential real estate market conditions improved   throughout the District, while commercial and industrial market conditions   continued to lag behind. Overall lending activity at a sample of large District   banks increased modestly in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth   quarter of 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in   April and early May were up, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 52   percent of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 36 percent saw decreases   and 12 percent saw no changes. About 41 percent of the respondents noted that   sales levels met their expectations, 32 percent reported that sales were below   expectations, and 27 percent reported that sales were above expectations.   Lower-priced items, apparel, and shoes were strong sellers, while higher-priced   items and gifts moved more slowly. About 61 percent of the contacts noted that   inventories were at desired levels, while 27 percent reported too-high   inventories and 12 percent reported too-low inventories. The sales outlook among   the retailers for this summer was mostly optimistic. About 73 percent of the   retailers expect sales to increase over 2009 levels, while 23 percent expect   sales to decrease and 4 percent expect sales to be similar to last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that, compared with last year, sales in   April and early May were up, on average. About 64 percent of the car dealers   surveyed saw increases in sales, while 9 percent saw decreases and 27 percent   saw no changes. About 33 percent of the car dealers noted that used car sales   had increased relative to new car sales, while 29 percent reported the opposite.   Also, 25 percent reported an increase in high-end vehicle sales relative to   low-end vehicle sales, while 13 percent reported the opposite. About 38 percent   of contacts reported more acceptances of finance applications, but 17 percent   reported more rejections. About half of the car dealers surveyed reported that   their inventories were too low (mostly on new vehicles), while 8 percent   reported that their inventories were too high. The sales outlook among the car   dealers for this summer was generally optimistic. About 67 percent of the car   dealers expect sales to increase over 2009 levels, but 12 percent expect sales   to decrease. The remaining 21 percent expect sales to be similar to last   year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity has increased since our previous report. A greater number of contacts   reported new hires and plant openings than reported job layoffs and plant   closings. Firms in the fabricated metal product, office supplies, plastics   product, and "hand and edge" tool manufacturing industries reported plans to   expand operations and hire new employees. A major firm in semiconductor and   related device manufacturing announced a significant amount of new hires along   with the opening of a new plant. Two smaller firms in primary metal   manufacturing also announced plans to open a new plant in the District and   expand employment. In contrast, firms in synthetic dye and pigment manufacturing   and pharmaceutical and medicine manufacturing reported plans to lay off workers   and decrease operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's services sector activity has been mixed since our previous   report. A firm in business support services announced job layoffs in response to   decreased demand. A major electrical utility announced layoffs at several power   plants and support service facilities. Several regional government agencies and   education services providers announced job cuts in response to budgets cuts. In   contrast, a major firm in the telecommunications industry announced that it will   lose significantly fewer employees from a recent merger than previously   expected. Additionally, a firm in the rail transportation industry announced   plans to make significant capital improvements to the rail network.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales increased in many   areas of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in 2009, April 2010   year-to-date home sales were up 25 percent in Louisville, 19 percent in Little   Rock, and 9 percent in St. Louis. Home sales declined 2 percent in Memphis over   the same period. Several contacts noted, however, that part of the increase was   likely the result of the expiring home buyer tax credit. Residential   construction continued to improve throughout the District. April 2010   year-to-date single-family housing permits increased in nearly all District   metro areas compared with the same period in 2009. Permits increased 65 percent   in Memphis, 56 percent in St. Louis, 39 percent in Little Rock, and 38 percent   in Louisville.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate market activity continued to be slow   throughout the District. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2009, first-quarter   2010 industrial vacancy rates decreased in Memphis but increased in Little Rock,   Louisville, and St. Louis. During the same period, the suburban office vacancy   rate increased in Little Rock, Louisville, and Memphis and remained the same in   St. Louis. The downtown office vacancy rate decreased in Little Rock but   increased in Louisville, Memphis, and St. Louis. Several contacts throughout the   District reported that commercial and industrial construction is at a standstill   and is not expected to pick up until sometime in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of District banks showed a modest increase in overall lending activity in   the first quarter of 2010 relative to the fourth quarter of 2009. During this   period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans remained basically   unchanged, while demand for these loans varied slightly from moderately weaker   to moderately stronger. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans ranged   from unchanged to tightened somewhat, while demand for these loans was   moderately stronger. Credit standards for consumer loans remained basically   unchanged, while demand was about the same. Credit standards for residential   mortgages were unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from about the   same to moderately stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Recent rains throughout   the District caused some fieldwork delays. Planting of corn, cotton, and rice   was ahead of its 5-year average pace, while planting of soybeans and sorghum was   behind normal pace in most District states. Emergence of these crops was ahead   of normal in most cases. About two-thirds of the winter wheat in Illinois and   Missouri and at least 90 percent in the other District states were rated in fair   or better condition.
