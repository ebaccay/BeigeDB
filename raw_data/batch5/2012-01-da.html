      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 11, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy grew at a moderate pace since the last report.   Manufacturing activity was mixed. Contacts said retail sales were robust and   automobile sales held steady. Demand for business services was solid, and   activity in transportation services rose modestly. Housing and commercial real   estate markets continued to improve slightly. Construction activity remained   subdued, with apartment construction being the major exception. Financial   services respondents said overall loan demand was flat to up slightly. Energy   activity slowed somewhat, but respondents expect strong growth in activity in   2012. Agricultural conditions remained weak. Employment levels were mostly   unchanged. Price and wage pressures were subdued.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts across industries said prices held steady   or declined. The exceptions were producers of paper, fabricated metals and food   who noted increased prices for some inputs. Crop commodity prices were generally   lower than six weeks ago, while cattle prices held fairly steady.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of WTI moved in a narrow range between $95 and $100 per barrel   during the reporting period. Natural gas prices remained low, near $3.50 per   thousand cubic feet, due to unseasonably warm weather and large inventories.   Diesel and gasoline prices declined by 20 cents per gallon over the past six   weeks, and prices of petrochemicals and plastics held steady or fell   slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment levels were flat to up slightly   at most responding firms. Staffing firms continued to note high levels of   demand. Energy industry respondents said labor shortages for skilled workers,   such as engineers, geologists, and machinists, remained a barrier to expansion.   Some producers of food, fabricated metals and transportation equipment noted   moderate employment increases, and auto dealers said they continue to look for   additional workers. Wage pressures remained minimal, although staffing firms   noted modest increases in billing rates for skilled workers. Several firms noted   plans to give employees cost-of-living adjustments next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Construction-related manufacturers'   responses were mixed. Stone, clay and glass producers said demand was below   expectations, while lumber producers noted no change in activity. Fabricated   metals producers said demand had increased since the last report, and some   reported a pickup in private nonresidential projects, especially from foreign   investors. Primary metals demand was mostly stable and was characterized as   "decent but not great." Construction-related firms' outlooks are cautiously   optimistic for 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported that sales grew at a weak to   moderate pace since the last report. Sales and prices for DRAM continued to be   very weak, while demand and prices for processors were holding up much better.   Respondents said that increased demand for mobile devices and data storage   should drive up demand for semiconductors by the second quarter of 2012.   Respondents noted, however, that economic uncertainty remains very high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the paper industry were mixed. Most contacts noted weakness,   although one reported an unusually busy December with strong orders from the   auto and construction industries. Respondents expect conditions to remain about   the same in 2012 as in 2011. Automobile and aviation equipment manufacturers   said demand had picked up slightly since the last report. Expectations are for   stronger sales of automobile equipment in 2012, but aviation manufacturers   expect only modest growth. Food producers noted a pickup in demand since the   last report, in part due to stronger consumer demand, and partly due to   increased market share. Outlooks among food industry contacts remain   positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical producers noted a seasonal slowdown in demand for most   products. Producers of plastics and plastic feedstocks said prices and   inventories stabilized after sharp declines in October and November. Demand for   chlorine showed weakness beyond the normal seasonal slowing, and some contacts   attributed the weakness to slower global growth. Contacts in the refining   industry noted weak domestic consumption of refined products, especially   gasoline, although export markets were still strong. Inventories were said to be   near expectations for this time of year. While both gasoline and diesel prices   slipped over the past six weeks, refiners' margins remained at healthy levels,   according to contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers said sales activity was robust   during the reporting period, and retail sales growth saw moderate gains over the   comparable year-ago period. However, contacts noted consumers remain cautious   and value-driven. The Eleventh District and Midwest in general exhibited   stronger sales growth than other parts of the nation, according to the   responding firms. Inventories have increased over the prior year, but are at   desired levels. Jewelry, small electronics and apparel were areas of strength in   retail this holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales held steady from the prior report and have increased   year-over-year. The used car market remains tight. Contacts expect 2012 will be   another good year, with moderate increases in sales. Vehicle inventories are   back to normal levels for the most part, although some contacts reported light   inventories due to increased activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms continued to report high levels   of demand. However, some contacts noted a slight slowdown in activity as some   clients delayed hiring until the start of 2012. Direct hires continued to drive   business, with particularly strong demand for professional and technical   workers. One contact noted a shortage of skilled IT professionals. Outlooks were   more optimistic than in the last report, with contacts expecting demand to   remain robust or improve next year. Demand for accounting services remained   flat, and overall growth this year has been slightly weaker than expected. Legal   firms reported steady activity, with continued strength in demand for   intellectual property, energy, litigation and some real-estate services and a   slight pickup in corporate activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from transportation service firms were positive. Intermodal firms   reported steady cargo volumes during the reporting period, and outlooks are   positive for the first half of 2012. Railroad firms noted a broad-based increase   in shipments, with particularly strong growth in petroleum products, motor   vehicles and equipment, nonmetallic minerals, crushed stone, metals and metallic   ores. Small parcel shipments rose strongly during the reporting period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Airlines reported steady passenger demand over the past six weeks. Domestic   demand and travel to Latin America remained solid, and travel to Europe and Asia   improved slightly. Airline contacts expect demand to remain stable in the short   term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing industry contacts   continue to report improving conditions overall, although sales activity remains   at low levels. Home sales rose at a modest pace over the reporting period and   new and existing home inventories continued to decline. Contacts are hopeful   that the housing industry is poised for a recovery in 2012. Apartment demand   remained steady since the last report and contacts characterize Texas markets as   tight. Apartment construction continues to increase, and contacts noted that   multi-family properties are the favored property type among real estate   investors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in nonresidential property markets continue to firm,   according to most contacts. Demand for office space continued to rise modestly   since the last report, and there were some reports of improvement in demand for   warehouse and retail space. Nonresidential construction activity remains at low   levels, and some contacts noted concern about 2012 as public projects come to a   close. One contact noted that while conditions have improved overall, real   estate financing remains a challenge due to weak consumer sentiment and higher   investment risk.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial firms reported flat to   modest increases in loan demand. National banks noted a pickup in both middle-   and large-market corporate lending activity. Regional banks said loan demand was   mixed, with strength in energy-related lending and weakness in other loan   activity. Loan pricing remained competitive. The quality of loans outstanding   continued to improve, with contacts noting a decline in problem loans. Outlooks   are uncertain given mostly sluggish loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Oil field activity slowed seasonally at year end,   with the District rig count edging down. However, respondents expect a high   level of activity to resume early in 2012 and increase throughout the year.   Respondents cited strong orders, growing backlogs, and good pricing for their   products as evidence of future growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The District remained largely in drought,   although recent rainfalls have lessened the drought's severity in most parts and   benefitted the winter wheat crop. There is still very little grazing available,   resulting in costly supplemental feeding of livestock. Demand for agricultural   products receded slightly over the reporting period, although beef exports   remained strong.
