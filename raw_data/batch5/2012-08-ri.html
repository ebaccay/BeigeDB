      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifth District economic activity improved somewhat in most sectors since our   last report, although manufacturing and employment weakened. Retail sales   improved, and non-retail services providers reported a moderate increase in   demand. Tourism contacts generally indicated that summer business was strong,   and they anticipated a busy autumn season. Widespread precipitation in July and   August brought relief from drought conditions, boosting expected crop yields.   Residential real estate activity inched up, while commercial real estate reports   were mixed. Lending activity also varied, and most mortgage lending was for   refinancing. Manufacturing activity softened as orders declined. Weaker District   hiring was led by a slowdown in requests for temp workers, although demand for   highly skilled employees persisted. Price changes generally slowed in both the   manufacturing and services sectors, with the exception of a small uptick in   retail.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District manufacturing activity continued   to decline since our last report. A manufacturer reported that demand fell   sharply for heating equipment components, with domestic and European customers   both reducing their orders. An auto supplier also reported a significant drop in   new orders in the past two months. Another auto parts manufacturer stated that   earlier in the year, demand for his components was growing, but now orders were   "treading water." He added that inventories were rising and he expected to cut   production. A food manufacturer reported that power outages from recent storms   resulted in a one-week shutdown, and production did not return to normal for   over three weeks. According to our latest manufacturing survey, growth in raw   materials prices slowed over the past month, while finished goods prices edged   downward.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retailers reported improved sales since our last   report. Merchants in several states had a successful "tax free weekend" in early   August. In addition, some department store contacts said they were able to clear   inventories of patio furniture and other seasonal items. Several jewelry   retailers also reported increased sales. Record heat this summer helped to push   air conditioner sales, with one big-box store depleting its entire inventory. An   auto industry contact reported that District sales grew at a somewhat slower   pace in recent weeks, although demand remained especially strong for mid-size   vehicles. Used cars remained in short supply, putting upward pressure on prices   and improving trade-in values. A number of apparel and furniture contacts noted   that inventories for the upcoming holiday shopping season will be kept tight,   since they expect to be able to easily reorder as needed. Grocery executives   expected price increases in meat and dairy products, due to rising feed costs   caused by drought. The pace of retail price change rose moderately, according to   our most recent survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Accounts from non-retail services firms were   generally positive in recent weeks. An executive at a North Carolina healthcare   system reported that demand for services had been steady, adding that there were   a few "sparks" from the arrival of new businesses in an otherwise stagnant local   economy. Contacts at healthcare organizations expressed concern about potential   Medicare reimbursement cuts that will come with the change to value-based   metrics under the new healthcare legislation. Ground freight firms reported   solid demand and higher shipping rates. A freight service executive reported   that retailers increasingly have moved to an online presence in addition to   in-store sales, contributing to growth in direct shipping to customers through   internet sales. Technology services continued to be in strong demand,   particularly for developing websites, mobile services, and cloud computing. On   balance, responses to our recent survey were that price increases at services   firms moderated since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Banking activity was little changed from the   weak, but somewhat mixed conditions that prevailed in our last report. Most   bankers said that very few new loans were made recently and the number of loans   in the pipeline was shrinking. An often-cited exception was mortgage   refinancing, as well as business loans that were captured from other banks by   offers of better terms. However, several mortgage lenders noted some increase in   new home loans, especially in the mid-priced range, and one official reported a   modest increase in single-home construction loans. A Maryland banker cited a   sharp increase in small business loans, but several other bankers stated that   many small business loan applications did not meet lending standards. A lending   officer in northern Virginia reported a slowdown in industrial loans due to   rising economic uncertainty. A banker in West Virginia noted strength in   industrial loans going into the state's energy sector, although he expected   lending to decline after the completion of current mining projects. While   margins continued to be squeezed, most bankers described loan quality as stable   following several quarters of steady improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential real estate activity continued to   improve since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area said that sales   were up double digits over last year and pending sales had increased sharply   from a year ago. Moreover, his company had seen a marked increase in prices. An   agent in the D.C. area also reported strong sales "inside the Beltway." A   Realtor in the Fredericksburg area indicated that sales had increased and   traffic was very active for this time of year, noting that the average sales   price had risen by about $40,000 over last year. She mentioned that her firm had   seen virtually no listings of foreclosed properties in July, and she saw fewer   short sales. A West Virginia developer, who specializes in second homes in the   mountains, stated that there had been an increase in inquiries and contracts for   homes after four years without any sales. Similarly, a contractor reported a   solid increase in home sales in the Charleston, South Carolina area, with the   average price of new homes sold rising slightly as well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate activity remained mixed over the last few weeks. A few   Realtors pointed to companies that were downsizing their space requirements as a   cause for limited new construction and high vacancy rates. An agent in the D.C.   area reported a recent drop in office leasing activity by as much as half from   year-ago levels. However, several Realtors noted that, due to the lack of office   construction, landlords had been offering fewer incentives to capture or retain   tenants at existing properties. Retail leasing activity was mostly described as   weak, especially among small, locally owned businesses. A contact in northern   Virginia noted weakness in many segments of the market, but notable exceptions   included car dealerships, gas stations and doctors' offices. A North Carolina   real estate agent reported that purchasing activity had picked up markedly among   his investment clients, which he attributed to national firms being increasingly   attracted to the region. A few pockets of improvement in both leasing and   construction activity were noted in eastern South Carolina, which has benefited   from an expansion in the aerospace industry, and in northern West Virginia,   where gains were driven by natural gas drilling.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Labor market activity weakened since our   last report. Contacts at several employment agencies described demand for   workers as softening in the past six weeks. In Richmond, several small retailers   said that they did not hire summer workers and they were not planning additional   hiring for the year-end holiday selling season.Ã‚Â  One agent noted that demand was   slightly below normal for this time of year, but he hoped to see a rebound   similar to the one that occurred late last summer. However, a few pockets of   strength persisted. For example, most employment agencies continued to report   strong demand for highly skilled IT employees, as jobs created by new   technologies drove the market for those workers. Additionally, several contacts   noted an increase in demand for truck drivers. According to our recent surveys,   wages in both the manufacturing and service sectors were growing at a slightly   slower pace than a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District resorts reported a very good summer   season, with rentals and hotel bookings up from a year ago. Local restaurants   and shops have been busy, and a contact on the Outer Banks of North Carolina   said that new businesses were opening to serve vacationers. Cruise ships leaving   the Port of Baltimore have been fully booked, according to a contact there. In   Washington, D.C., a contact observed more tour buses in recent weeks and bigger   weekend crowds on the National Mall. However, according to a couple of Baltimore   hotel managers, bookings for conferences and leisure stays were mixed.   Additionally, a hotel contact in the Virginia Beach area said that bookings were   making "no great strides," primarily as a result of government travel cuts.   Despite the lack of momentum in government travel, most hoteliers said that they   were able to raise rates slightly. Looking ahead to late autumn, executives were   optimistic about bookings, as localities planned historical commemorations,   music programs, food festivals, marathons, and other social events. In South   Carolina, a hotel manager anticipated that a new carrier at a nearby airport   would provide solid bookings in the months ahead.
     </p>

      <strong>
       Agriculture
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Widespread precipitation since our last   report helped revitalize crops and pastureland in many areas of the District.   Rain in early August aided late summer peaches in Maryland and West Virginia,   and soybeans were responding to improved weather conditions in Virginia. Cotton   and peanut growers in the District are also having a great year. In South   Carolina, the cantaloupe and watermelon harvest was virtually complete by early   August. Results of our recent agricultural credit survey indicated that farmland   values were above both the previous quarter and year-ago levels.
