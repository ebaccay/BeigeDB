      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 30, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Twelfth District continued to grow at a moderate   pace during the reporting period of October through mid-November. Price   increases for final goods and services were limited, and upward pressures on   wages were subdued overall. Sales of retail items rose further, and demand grew   modestly for business and consumer services. District manufacturing activity   edged up on balance. Sales continued to grow for agricultural producers, and   activity expanded for extractors of energy and other natural resources. Demand   for residential and nonresidential real estate remained weak on balance.   Contacts from financial institutions reported little or no change in overall   loan demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price inflation for final goods and   services was limited during the reporting period. Contacts noted a recent uptick   in the prices for energy inputs, particularly oil, and price increases for   assorted food items at the retail level. However, the combination of robust   supplier competition and lackluster final demand continued to hold down price   pressures for most retail goods and services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upward wage pressures were very modest overall, although contacts noted   persistent upward pressure on benefit costs, especially for employee health   care. High levels of unemployment and limited demand for new employees kept   compensation gains minimal in most regions and sectors. The primary exception   was workers in information technology fields, such as software developers, who   continued to see high levels of recruiting activity and significant wage   increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales grew further on   balance. Modest gains were noted for traditional department stores and discount   chains alike, with particular demand strength for small appliances and other   inexpensive household products. By contrast, sales were largely unchanged for   retailers of major appliances, furniture, and electronics. Sales were largely   flat for grocers, and industry contacts noted that they are keeping a close eye   on inventories at the start of the holiday season to avoid overstocking. Sales   of new automobiles continued to strengthen, with replenished inventories for   some Japanese brands supporting sales gains in response to growing consumer   demand. For the upcoming holiday retail season, contacts generally expect sales   to match or slightly exceed the levels reached during last year's season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for business and consumer services was largely stable or slightly   improved on balance. Sales continued to grow for providers of technology   services, in particular for software applications used for mobile computing and   communication devices, although the pace of growth eased a bit further. Energy   utilities noted largely stable demand from businesses and households. Demand for   professional services, such as legal services and accounting, also was described   as largely unchanged. Providers of health-care services reported that demand   softened a bit further, as reflected in a slight decline in inpatient admissions   and surgical procedures. Activity in the District's travel and tourism industry   picked up: contacts in Hawaii noted an uptick in visitor volumes, reversing the   slight decline in the prior period, and contacts in San Diego and Las Vegas   reported ongoing increases in hotel occupancy rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity in the District   firmed a bit further on net during the reporting period of October through   mid-November. For manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products,   capacity utilization rates remained quite high; demand growth stayed positive   but continued to slow, especially for components used in consumer electronics   products. Production activity expanded a bit from existing high levels for   makers of commercial aircraft and parts, as modest growth in new orders added to   an existing backlog. Activity was largely stable or up slightly for metal   fabricators. For petroleum refiners, weak domestic demand for gasoline was   offset by robust domestic and export demand for distillate products, notably   diesel fuel, holding overall capacity utilization rates near their long-term   averages. Production activity continued to expand for food manufacturers, while   demand stayed stuck at depressed levels for manufacturers of wood products.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand growth   and sales were robust for agricultural products, and extraction activity   expanded further for minerals and natural resources used for energy production.   Orders and sales continued to grow for assorted crops and livestock products,   especially for those with extensive export markets. Contacts noted that   agricultural input costs remained largely stable, with the exception of   significant increases in the cost of fertilizer. Mining activity expanded   further, propelled by high price levels for a variety of metals. Extraction   activity grew for crude oil, largely in response to robust foreign demand, and   demand for natural gas was largely unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales and construction   remained anemic, and demand for commercial real estate was largely stable but   weak. The pace of home sales was quite subdued, with contacts noting that   despite low interest rates, relatively strict lending requirements have   constrained purchasing activity. As a result of lackluster sales and the large   number of financially distressed properties, the pace of home construction   stayed depressed and home prices remained flat. By contrast, demand for   residential rental units grew further. Demand for commercial real estate   remained weak overall, as reflected in elevated vacancy rates and heightened   caution by tenants to commit to long-term leases. However, declining vacancy   rates were noted for selected geographic areas that are benefiting from growth   in the technology sector, primarily the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle. The   vast majority of contacts expect demand in residential and commercial real   estate markets to change little in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand was largely unchanged compared with the   prior reporting period. With businesses remaining cautious in their approach to   capital spending, the volume of new commercial and industrial loans stayed   slightly depressed overall. However, reports continued to indicate stiff   competition among lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and   medium-sized businesses, which has been creating downward pressure on rates and   fees. No changes in demand for consumer credit were noted. Slight improvements   in overall credit quality were noted, but lending standards remained relatively   restrictive for many types of business and consumer loans. In a departure from   prior positive reports, contacts from the venture capital sector reported a   slowdown in investment activity and funding.
