      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixth District business contacts described economic activity as expanding at   a somewhat stronger pace in January and early February compared with late last   year. Expectations were generally more positive, although firms continued to   express caution with regard to the outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers noted that sales and traffic increased compared with a year ago and   auto sales remained robust. Hospitality contacts, with the exception of cruise   lines, reported strong bookings for this year. Homebuilders and brokers reported   that unseasonably warm weather has helped bolster residential real estate   activity by pulling some activity forward. Nonetheless, overall home sales and   construction levels remained weak apart from the generally robust multifamily   sector. Manufacturers and transportation contacts continued to note positive   activity on balance. Bankers reported a modest improvement in loan activity at   larger institutions. More firms reported increased hiring, although contacts   continued to signal they approached hiring decisions very cautiously. Concerns   over increased input costs generally eased as most firms reported that input   prices leveled off. Only a few contacts reported having significant pricing   power.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retail contacts   noted that sales and traffic in January and early February were up from a year   ago. Final holiday sales reports were generally positive as slightly over half   of our retail contacts indicated that sales were better than last year. Roughly   half noted that inventory levels were up slightly compared with last month, and   most were satisfied with current levels. Most merchants expect overall sales to   improve over the next three months. Retailers also expect overall sales to   improve modestly over the course of 2012. Auto dealers noted that the warm   weather experienced in January likely boosted sales for the month, and they   anticipate new vehicle sales to continue to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Hospitality contacts reported that tourism activity remained strong and most   were optimistic regarding the outlook for leisure and hospitality spending in   2012. Attendance for major conventions increased and bookings and lead volume   rose, according to business travel contacts. However, there were concerns about   higher fuel costs and the adverse impact it may have on drive-to traffic at   regional tourist destinations. Cruise line bookings have suffered in the wake of   the maritime disaster in Italy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The majority of District   residential brokers reported that home sales accelerated in January and early   February and stand above levels from the same time period last year. However,   reports from Florida brokers were more mixed. Contacts noted that inventory   levels continued to decline on year-over-year basis and home prices were nearly   even with a year ago. The outlook among brokers for sales growth continued to   improve with most anticipating modest year-over-year gains over the next several   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most District homebuilders indicated that new home sales and construction   activity growth, measured year-over-year, increased slightly during January and   early February; however, several contacts noted that unseasonably warm weather   in the region likely pulled some activity forward. Builders continued to report   downward pressure on home prices while new home inventories remained below   year-earlier levels. Contacts noted that multifamily construction remained   robust. Over the next several months, homebuilders anticipate new home sales and   construction to be flat to slightly up compared with a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most commercial real estate contacts indicated that conditions continued to   improve slowly in the region. Contractors noted a slight improvement in demand   but the market remained very competitive and activity remained at low levels.   Brokers continued to report modest improvements in demand for space in several   parts of the District with some noting that rent concessions had abated. The   outlook among contacts was similar to our last report with most contractors and   commercial real estate brokers anticipating that construction activity will   improve slowly during 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers across the   region noted more positive results in January and early February compared with   previous reports. In particular, firms reported increased levels of new orders   along with improved expectations for future orders. Most contacts also signaled   that inventory levels have risen in line with these improved order expectations.   Three major auto manufacturers announced plans to increase production at their   facilities in Alabama and Georgia, and a foreign automaker also noted that a   parts manufacturing facility will relocate to the Sixth District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Transportation contacts reported that inventory-building trends appeared to   be similar to the end of last year. A freight forwarding company noted that   orders were stable and a large railroad firm continued to report strong   increases in auto shipments. Coal inventory levels declined at the end of last   year, but in recent months have exceeded targeted levels as mild weather and low   natural gas prices dampened demand for coal-fired electricity generation.   Contacts noted that both imports and exports have leveled off since the   beginning of the fourth quarter of 2011, although trade with Latin America   continued to experience modest growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Liquidity levels remained high at   regional banks as most continued to experience high deposit balances and soft   loan demand. Several large banks noted some growth in outstanding C&amp;I loans;   in part, a result of loan acquisitions from other institutions and continued   growth in areas such as energy and healthcare. Bankers also reported increased   consumer lending attributed mainly to auto financing. Contacts remain cautious   regarding the economic environment and most are forecasting low loan growth in   2012, but do not expect further deterioration in capital levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Firms indicated that hiring   expectations going into 2012 are better than they had been going into 2011.   However, many contacts noted that plans to increase profits still revolved   around further efficiency gains from improvements in internal operations.   Several businesses reported plans to increase payrolls because they expect an   improvement in sales going forward. They appeared to have regained their   customer base, and these expectations seem to be transmitting into plans for   expansion. Some firms still indicated a preference for contract workers for   short-term projects, but several expressed increased willingness to consider   them for permanent positions. Aside from optimism about future sales, some   contacts also reasoned that their current employees do not always possess the   necessary skills, leaving firms with no choice but to hire new workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Concerns over increased input costs eased further, although several   manufacturing firms did note an increase in commodity prices since the last   report. Few contacts reported having significant pricing power. According to the   firms surveyed in the Atlanta Fed's January Business Inflation Expectations   (BIE) survey, unit costs were expected to rise 1.8 percent for the year ahead,   down slightly from December expectations. Firms continue to operate in an   environment of below normal sales and depressed margins, according to the   survey, though both have been slowly improving since October of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the energy   exploration sector noted that recent lease auctions have helped stimulate more   industry optimism, contributing to an improvement in investment conditions.   Regional gasoline inventories remained above their seasonal norms for this time   of year as national and global gasoline consumption remain relatively soft,   although contacts reported ongoing concern about the impact of geopolitical   uncertainty in some OPEC countries on energy prices going forward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Significant rains have eased drought conditions in parts of Alabama,   Mississippi, and Louisiana, while parts of Georgia and Florida have seen drought   conditions worsen. Mild temperatures throughout the region are of concern to   peach and other fruit crop growers hoping for adequate conditions for the   current growing season. On a year-over-year basis, prices received by farmers   were higher for many of the region's agricultural products. Contacts reported   that some farmers in Alabama and Georgia were reviewing their planting plans in   light of their concerns of labor shortages.
