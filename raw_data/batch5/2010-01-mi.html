      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 13, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity in the Ninth District grew tepidly since the last   report. Consumer spending, tourism, energy, mining and residential construction   and real estate saw modest increases. Manufacturing and services were mixed,   while commercial construction was stable. Decreases in activity occurred in   agriculture. Labor markets remained weak, but the pace of job losses has slowed.   Meanwhile, wage increases were modest, and overall prices remained flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending increased   modestly. A representative of a Minneapolis area mall expected holiday sales to   finish 2.5 percent higher than a year ago, while a manager at another   Minneapolis area mall noted that holiday traffic was relatively heavy and that   store owners were generally pleased. Bank directors reported that holiday sales   during December were soft in western South Dakota, but up somewhat in North   Dakota. Brisk retail activity was reported in central Montana the day after   Christmas. Larger retailers noted an increase in Internet sales during the   holiday shopping season.
     </p>
     <p>
      A Minnesota auto dealer noted that November and December sales were up from a   year ago. Meanwhile, a representative of an auto dealers association in North   Dakota reported that recent vehicle sales were generally soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      Winter tourism activity was up from a year ago. Tourism activity increased in   northwestern Wisconsin due to excellent snow conditions for snowmobiling and   skiing. In western South Dakota, winter sports have also benefited from a deep   snow cover; a local tourism official noted strong numbers of vehicles with   snowmobile trailers and ski racks. A Minnesota ski resort reported that activity   picked up during the holidays; advanced bookings were about on par with a year   ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was   flat at low levels. A commercial builder in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area said   that recent activity was very slow, but the builder expected more projects to   bid on in the first part of 2010. Residential construction increased across most   of the District. The number of residential permits in November was up compared   with a year ago in Sioux Falls, SD., Fargo, ND., Rochester, Minn., and in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
     </p>
     Commercial real estate markets saw a slight uptick   from very low levels of activity. The value of commercial properties sold in   Minnesota increased in November from October. However, recent vacancy rates for   many commercial real estate sectors were higher than a year ago across most of   the District. Meanwhile, residential market activity increased in November. The   dollar volume of closed sales in Minnesota increased nearly 46 percent in   November from a year earlier as first-time home buyers took advantage of federal   tax credits.
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall activity was mixed in the professional   business services sector. A Minnesota-based travel services firm shut down due   to decreased demand. A health care provider noted that people deciding on   elective surgery are asking for limited procedures at reduced cost. However, an   environmental engineering firm noted solid orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was mixed. A December   survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha, Neb.) showed that   manufacturing activity increased in Minnesota and decreased in the Dakotas. This   survey showed strong new orders in Minnesota and South Dakota, but decreased new   orders in North Dakota. In South Dakota, a pipe maker plans to open a production   facility, but a trailer manufacturer shut down.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased slightly. Mid-December oil and gas exploration increased from   mid-November. A proposed large-scale wind energy project was recently announced   for eastern South Dakota. Meanwhile, late December prices for copper, platinum   and nickel increased from mid-November, which aided the profitability of Montana   mines. An iron ore mine plans to restart a production line in early 2010, but   output at iron ore mines in Minnesota dropped about 5 percent in November from   October.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity declined. The wet fall   caused farmers to incur extra drying expenses, and some shortages of propane   were noted. A portion of the corn crop will have to be harvested in the spring   because winter storms halted the already late harvest; this may constrain   overall production from expected high levels. The heavy winter storms put stress   on some cattle herds.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained   weak, but the pace of job losses has slowed. While employment levels are lower   than a year ago, employment increased slightly in November from a month earlier   in Minnesota and the Dakotas. Nevertheless, some layoffs were announced. In   Montana a paper mill will close, affecting over 400 workers. In Minnesota a call   center closure will eliminate about 60 jobs, and an information management firm   will cut 120 positions. In contrast, a financial services firm announced plans   to add 50 to 75 jobs in South Dakota. According to respondents to a recent St.   Cloud (Minn.) Area Business Outlook Survey, 19 percent expect to increase   employment at their companies over the next six months, while 15 percent expect   decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wages generally remained level or rose modestly, and this trend may continue.   For example, wages for most employees at the University of Montana will be   frozen for the next two years. Of the respondents to the aforementioned St.   Cloud survey, 19 percent plan to increase wages and benefits over the next six   months, while 6 percent plan decreases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices generally remained flat since the last report. For example, recent   Minnesota gasoline and fertilizer prices are about level with mid-November.   However, natural gas and some metal component prices have increased since the   last report.
