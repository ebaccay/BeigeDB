      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy expanded further in January and early February,   though inclement weather dampened consumer spending. Retailers reported that   severe winter storms contributed to limited sales but they expected a rebound in   coming months. District manufacturers reported solid growth since the previous   survey period and anticipated strong future activity. Little improvement was   noted in residential real estate; however, commercial real estate showed further   signs of stabilization. District banks reported a decrease in overall loan   demand, increased deposits, and stable loan quality. In agriculture, poor   growing conditions and tight supplies raised commodity prices. Hiring and   production expanded in the energy sector along with drilling activity in key oil   and gas liquids fields in the District. Retailers and manufacturers noted added   pressure on profit margins from increased materials costs. There was little   evidence of wage pressures across District labor markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many District retailers reported that   unusually severe winter storms limited sales activity in January and early   February. Several retail contacts noted temporary layoffs and reduced hours for   workers in response to the inclement weather. Overall, sales generally remained   at or above year-ago levels and most retailers remained optimistic that sales   would increase in coming months. While auto sales softened due to severe winter   storms, dealers were satisfied with inventory levels and expected a sharp   rebound in sales in the near future. Most tourism contacts reported decreased   visitor counts compared with month- and year-ago levels, and respondents   indicated severe winter weather as a possible deterrent. However, mountain ski   resorts reported strong results due to the heavy winter snowfall. Hotel   operators reported that occupancy rates remained flat during the reporting   period while room rates continued to decline. Most lodging respondents expected   no change in occupancy rates and continued declines in room rates in the coming   months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District   manufacturing activity continued to expand, while high-tech services and   transportation activity slowed somewhat. Factory production and orders expanded   solidly, and backlogs rose moderately. Inventories of both raw and finished   goods increased slightly. Many manufacturers hired additional workers and   anticipated hiring gains will remain solid in the coming six months. Concerns   persisted about rising input costs, but an increasing number of factory   operators reported an ability to raise finished goods prices. Planned capital   expenditures at factories were up, although most contacts reported adequate   capacity. Sales at high-tech firms softened in the latest reporting period,   especially those related to federal stimulus spending. High-tech contacts   nonetheless noted strength in sales related to data centers and e-commerce.   Transportation firms reported weak activity in the current reporting period but   remained optimistic that conditions would improve in the coming three months.   Several transportation contacts cited rising fuel costs and difficulty finding   qualified drivers as possible constraints on future growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   activity remained sluggish in January and early February, while the commercial   real estate sector showed further signs of stabilization. The residential real   estate sector remained hampered by falling transaction volumes and increased   inventories of unsold homes. Weak sales of both new and existing homes put   further downward pressure on home prices, but real estate agents anticipated a   surge in home sales this spring due to seasonal buying patterns. Although   housing starts were flat, residential builders remained upbeat and reported a   rebound in traffic. Commercial real estate activity stabilized with increased   sales and leasing activity, reduced vacancy rates, and increased absorption.   Nonetheless, further declines were reported in rents and selling prices and   developers' access to credit remained constrained. Mortgage lenders noted a   continued decline in mortgage loan demand and refinance activity due to rising   mortgage interest rates. In addition, mortgage lenders noted a decrease in   average loan size and higher average down payments.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported weaker loan demand, increased   deposits, and an improved outlook for loan quality in the recent reporting   period. Overall loan demand decreased slightly as demand for commercial and   industrial loans, residential real estate loans, and consumer installment loans   decreased while commercial real estate loan demand edged up. For the fourth   straight survey, credit standards remained unchanged in all major loan   categories. Loan quality was mostly unchanged from the previous period, while   the outlook for loan quality over the next six months improved. Bankers reported   increased deposits with gains in transaction and money market accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The energy sector expanded further in January and   February as oil and gas firms reported increased hiring and production. Natural   gas production remained strong despite high inventory levels and only modest   seasonal gains in natural gas prices. Exploration in the District shifted   further toward crude oil and natural gas liquids, particularly in New Mexico and   the Niobrara oil shale formation in Colorado and Wyoming. Producers anticipated   continued soft natural gas prices and steady crude oil prices in the next three   months, despite concerns over international instability. A number of energy   contacts cited continued competitive pressures for drilling equipment and   workers as constraints on future drilling activity, but access to capital was   viewed as adequate. Wyoming coal production remained well above year-ago levels.   Higher corn prices trimmed ethanol profits in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Poor growing conditions and tight supplies   lifted commodity prices and farm incomes since the previous survey period. While   winter wheat crop conditions deteriorated due to dry, cold weather, recent   snowfall eased drought conditions in the southern Plains. Heavy snowfall also   limited grazing and prompted some supplemental cattle feeding. Tight global   supplies supported high crop prices, boosting farm income. Cattle and hog prices   strengthened with higher demand, but rising feed costs limited profits.   Operating loan demand weakened as farmers used cash to pre-pay for crop inputs.   Capital spending rose briskly. District contacts reported collateral   requirements held steady and ample funds were available for farm loans at   historically low interest rates. Farmland prices surged with rising farm income   and robust demand for farmland, with the strongest gains reported in Nebraska   and Kansas.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Input prices continued to increase in   many industries, but selling prices and wages generally remained steady.   Contacts expected sustained increases in input prices, and most expected higher   selling prices in coming months. Manufacturers reported persistent increases in   raw materials prices and anticipated the upward trend to continue. Increasing   commodity prices put upward pressure on food costs, particularly livestock   products. Restaurants reported tighter margins as menu prices remained flat in   the face of rising food costs; an uptick in fuel costs contributed to rising   building materials prices. Firms reported little evidence of wage pressures   across the District and anticipated little to no wage pressure in the near   future. A limited number of firms expected to hire seasonal workers in the next   three months, but few have considered wage increases to attract qualified   candidates.
