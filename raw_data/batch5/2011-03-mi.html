      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Ninth District economy continued to grow moderately since the last   report. Increases were noted in consumer spending, services, manufacturing and   agriculture, while energy and mining were stable at high levels. Commercial   construction showed a slight but surprising increase in activity. Tourism and   commercial real estate were level, and residential construction and real estate   decreased. Labor markets continued to strengthen moderately, and wage increases   were modest. While increases in prices for final goods and services remained   relatively subdued, a number of input price increases were noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending   increased. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   January were up almost 2 percent compared with a year earlier. A Minnesota-based   restaurant chain noted that January sales were up about 5 percent compared with   a year ago. A domestic auto dealer in Minnesota reported that sales of new and   used cars were strong. However, a Minneapolis area mall noted that traffic in   January was down somewhat from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall winter tourism activity was on par with last year. A Minnesota travel   company noted that leisure travel to warm weather destinations was up   substantially from a year ago; however, another Minnesota travel company   reported only modest gains in winter activity. Winter tourism was about the same   as last year in western South Dakota. A tourism official in the Upper Peninsula   of Michigan described activity there as soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction   showed unexpected signs of growth. January commercial building permits increased   from the same month a year earlier in Fargo, N.D., and Sioux Falls, S.D. A large   software company recently announced plans to open a technology center in   suburban Minneapolis. Residential construction activity decreased. The value of   permitted units fell 7 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul in January from a year   earlier, largely driven by reductions in multifamily construction; single-family   home building remained stable. Residential permits fell in value in Sioux Falls   and increased slightly in Fargo during the same period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets were flat overall. In Minneapolis-St. Paul,   office vacancy remained high, but the market saw slight positive absorption in   the second half of 2010. Retail vacancy declined, and the medical market was   flat, while industrial space saw its highest vacancy rates in more than 10   years. Contacts in Fargo, N.D., and Billings, Mont., reported that commercial   real estate markets there were stable. Residential real estate activity   decreased. January closed sales increased 10 percent in Minneapolis-St. Paul   from a year earlier, but the median sales price fell 10 percent. Home prices   increased in parts of eastern Montana last year, but luxury- and tourism-driven   markets in the western part of the state remained very weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Professional business services firms reported   increased demand for their services since the start of 2011. About half of the   professional service firms responding to a mid-February Minneapolis Fed ad hoc   survey saw increased demand since the start of the year, while only 9 percent   saw declines in demand. A contact from a large accounting firm reported higher   than normal activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. A January survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University (Omaha,   Neb.) showed increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota, South Dakota and   North Dakota. Forty-six percent of the manufacturers responding to the   Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey saw increased demand since the start of the   year, while 23 percent saw declines in demand. Several Minnesota metal   fabricators noted a solid increase in orders since the last report. A Minnesota   manufacturer of drill bits said production increased. A semiconductor chip   facility in Minnesota plans to triple production this year. A steel component   plant in North Dakota recently expanded production due to increased capital   investment. However, a steel fabricator shut down in western Wisconsin, and a   manufacturer in the Upper Peninsula reported that severe weather delayed a   construction expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors remained stable at high levels since the last report. Mid-February oil   exploration activity was nearly flat since early January. Wind-energy   development projects continued since the last report. District mining commodity   prices remained robust, and District mines were operating at near capacity. A   company increased exploratory metal drilling activity in western Montana.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions continued to   strengthen. Prices for most District agricultural commodities increased since   the last report, including wheat, corn, soybeans, cattle, hogs and poultry;   however, dairy product prices decreased recently. The Minneapolis Fed's   fourth-quarter (January) survey of agricultural credit conditions indicated farm   incomes increased over the previous three months, and almost two-thirds of   respondents predicted increases in the next quarter. A decision by the U.S.   Department of Agriculture to allow planting of genetically modified sugar beets   came as a relief to District beet producers who had already purchased large   quantities of the seeds. Heavy snowfall this winter combined with a warm snap in   February led to concerns about potential flooding in parts of North Dakota and   Minnesota.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions   continued to strengthen moderately. In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, an   energy plant project at a paper mill will create about 170 new jobs. Demand for   temporary manufacturing workers was well above year-ago levels at a Minnesota   employment services company; strong candidates for permanent positions were   recently getting job offers more quickly than a few months ago. Minnesota   initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased 5 percent in January compared   with a year earlier. In contrast, a telecommunications company recently   announced plans to lay off 250 employees, and a defense contractor laid off   about 250 employees in Minnesota. In North Dakota, a wind power manufacturer   announced 150 layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases were modest. Bank directors noted just a few examples of wage   increases across a number of industries. However, some manufacturers in South   Dakota noted recent increases in wage pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      While increases in prices for final goods and services remained relatively   subdued, a number of input price increases were noted. According to the   Minneapolis Fed's ad hoc survey, 30 percent of respondents indicated that they   raised prices for final goods and services since the start of the year, while 47   percent noted that nonlabor input prices increased. A bank director reported   that farmers and ranchers were facing higher costs for fertilizer, feed, fuel   and chemicals compared with a year ago. Prices for copper, aluminum and some   steel products increased since the last report. Food commodity prices also   recently rose; however, some food companies in the District reported difficulty   passing these increases through to retail prices.
