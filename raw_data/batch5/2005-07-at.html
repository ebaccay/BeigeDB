      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Sixth District business contacts reported that the pace of economic activity 

  remained solid during June and early July. Disruptions from recent tropical 

  storms along the Gulf Coast are expected to have only a limited impact on overall 

  economic activity. Retail sales were up modestly from last year, and vehicle 

  sales benefited from new price discounts. Housing markets remained at robust 

  levels, although some slowing in activity was noted in several Florida markets. 

  Improvements continued in commercial real estate markets. Reports from manufacturers 

  were generally upbeat and most reports on tourism and business travel were quite 

  positive. Loan demand remained strong, especially in the housing segment, although 

  some lenders noted concern about the pace of condominium development in South 

  Florida. Contacts reported that labor markets improved, and shortages continued 

  in construction-related trades in several parts of the District. Price increases 

  were reported for industrial commodities, building products, energy-related 

  goods, and healthcare.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on retail sales during June and early July were generally positive. 

  Most contacts indicated that sales were up modestly from a year ago and were 

  in line with expectations. Inventories were described as balanced. Higher gasoline 

  prices did not appear to be having a significant impact on non-gasoline retail 

  sales overall, although some discount retailers noted reduced spending per customer. 

  Building supply and home improvement stores in Florida benefited from a two-week 

  tax holiday in early June on hurricane-related supplies. Most contacts said 

  they expect sales to rise slightly in the third quarter compared with last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      District vehicle sales improved in June. Several contacts cited a new round 

  of price discounts by domestic suppliers as boosting traffic and sales. Demand 

  for foreign brands remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home construction and sales in the District remained at high levels during June 

  and early July, although some deceleration was noted in a few Florida markets. 

  Realtors reported that sales in June rose slightly compared with last year, 

  while reports from builders were more mixed. Shortages of homes for sale continued 

  to be a problem in Florida, and some builders noted a shortage of available 

  land for development. Several Florida builders indicated that labor shortages 

  were an additional restraining factor. Overall, builders expect new home construction 

  to increase in Florida and remain steady throughout the rest of the District 

  in the second half of the year. Early reports on Hurricane Dennis suggest that 

  structural damage was not as widespread as last year, but repairs may add to 

  backlogs for many contractors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solid improvements continued to be noted in commercial real estate markets 

  across the District as expansion plans and new projects moved forward. Contacts 

  noted that office vacancy rates remain elevated on several markets but are generally 

  trending lower.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from the factory sector were positive. Production of building products, 

  lumber and gypsum board, and cement remained at high levels because of strong 

  residential construction. Manufacturing activity in defense-related industries 

  continued to be strong. A large refinery in Mississippi announced plans for 

  an expansion to increase production by about 25 percent. Contacts in manufactured 

  housing, machine tool, heavy truck, and electrical equipment sectors also cited 

  healthy levels of activity. Paper and packaging production was mixed; "away 

  from home" paper products were selling well, while shipments of packaging 

  material were off from levels seen earlier in the year. Hurricane Dennis reportedly 

  resulted in the temporary shut-in of some oil and natural gas supplies in the 

  Gulf.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most District transportation contacts reported good freight demand through 

  mid-year, although some noted a slower pace than earlier in the year. A shortage 

  of qualified drivers continues to be a concern for many trucking companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Despite the early start to the tropical storm season, most reports on tourism 

  and business travel were positive. In addition, most contacts indicated that 

  high fuel prices were not having a significant impact on travel overall. Tourist 

  activity in South Florida was very strong, and the prospects for the remainder 

  of the summer season were positive. Miami hotels reported high demand with record 

  occupancy and increased room rates. Theme park contacts stated that they were 

  enjoying a strong summer, with attendance ahead of last yearâ€™s pace, and 

  Orlando area hotels noted high occupancy levels. Reports from Tennessee destinations 

  and the Mississippi Gulf Coast were also upbeat. Convention business in Atlanta, 

  New Orleans, and Orlando improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial conditions in the Sixth District remained stable. Loan demand remained 

  strong in most areas, but concerns about the possibility of excessive condominium 

  construction in parts of Florida were noted by several contacts. Asset quality 

  remained high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports suggest that labor markets tightened in some sectors and temp hiring 

  increased in June and early July. For instance, a contact at a large temporary 

  staffing company said that their business was extremely strong and that the 

  company was starting to see shortages of both skilled and unskilled labor in 

  several sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices for lumber and other building products as well as several industrial 

  commodities continued to drift higher, and most businesses have reportedly been 

  able to pass on some of these increases to their customers. Rising energy prices 

  and healthcare costs continued to be noted by most contacts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tropical storm Cindy and Hurricane Dennis caused only limited damage to regional 

  crops. Crop conditions for cotton and peanuts were favorable, according to recent 

  USDA reports. Florida contacts noted that citrus canker continued to be found 

  throughout the Indian River Citrus District.
