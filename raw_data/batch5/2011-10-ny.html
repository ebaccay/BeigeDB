      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Second District has remained modest since the last   report, though there have been some signs of improvement in the labor market.   Manufacturers report some further deterioration in their assessment of overall   business conditions but note that orders, shipments and employment levels have   been stable. Consumer spending, on the other hand, has been comparatively   robust, despite low levels of consumer confidence: auto dealers report brisk   business in August and September, non-auto retail contacts report that sales   have been on or ahead of plan, and tourism activity has remained strong.   Commercial real estate markets have been mixed but, on balance, slightly   stronger since the last report. Home sales have been mixed, with scattered signs   of a pickup, while the rental market has continued to strengthen. New home   construction remains stalled, aside from rental apartments. There has been   substantial new hotel development in Manhattan. Conditions in New York City's   key securities industry have weakened noticeably. Finally, bankers report a   pickup in demand for residential mortgage loans (largely refinancing), a slight   increase in demand for non-residential mortgages, some easing in credit   standards for business loans, and little change in delinquency rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Non-auto retailers report that same   store sales were mostly on or ahead of plan in August and September and   moderately ahead of a year earlier. A number of contacts describe back-to-school   sales as fairly strong. One major mall in western New York State notes that a   large flow of Canadian shoppers has contributed significantly to strong overall   sales. While stores across much of the District had fairly widespread   disruptions from Hurricane Irene, the effects were relatively brief and there   was little or no net effect on sales or bottom line. Inventories are generally   reported to be in good shape, though one chain describes them as a bit high.   While some retailers reported sizable price increases for cotton-based apparel,   others indicated that they have held off on such increases thus far; prices of   other retail goods were generally reported to be steady to down slightly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in upstate New York report that sales picked up since the last   report, helped by a replenishment of their inventories, as disruptions from the   tsunami in Japan earlier this year dissipated. Buffalo-area dealers estimate   that sales of new vehicles were up 5-10 percent from a year ago in both August   and September. Rochester-area dealers indicate year-over-year sales gains of 11   percent in August and in the range of 10-15 percent for September. Auto dealers   in both areas continue to report strong sales of used cars, with persistently   lean inventories driving up prices. Dealers' service and parts departments also   report sturdy business. Auto-industry contacts describe both retail and   wholesale credit conditions as "fine".
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer confidence remains at depressed levels. The Conference Board reports   that consumer confidence among residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY, NJ,   PA) fell in August and edged down further in September. Siena College reports   that consumer confidence fell across most of New York State in the third   quarter, with the steepest declines seen in New York City and the mid-Hudson   Valley; only the Albany region saw an increase in confidence. Tourism activity   in New York City has shown continued strength since the last report. Broadway   theaters report that, aside from a brief swoon in business in late August due to   Hurricane Irene, attendance has been fairly strong and roughly on par with a   year earlier. Moreover, revenues for the full month of September were up nearly   10 percent from a year earlier, despite fewer than usual Broadway shows opening   this fall. Manhattan hotels report that revenue per room was up roughly 6   percent from a year ago in both August and September, despite the hurricane.   Most of this increase reflects higher room rates, as occupancy rates were little   changed. Nevertheless, this implies a sizeable rise in tourism, because there   are 6-7 percent more hotel rooms in Manhattan than a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction   remains moribund, particularly for single-family homes. Home sales have picked   up a bit in parts of the District but remain weak overall, while the rental   market has continued to strengthen. The housing market in northern New Jersey   remains sluggish: with a dearth of new home construction, aside from some   development of rental projects, the inventory of distressed properties has   declined slightly but remains large; sales volume remains sluggish, and home   prices have held steady and appear to have bottomed out. After a strong July and   August, sales of Manhattan apartments tapered off in September; while co-op   sales have been relatively sluggish, condominium sales have been buoyed by   foreign buyers. The inventory of available newly-constructed condos has declined   considerably in recent months but remains elevated. The lowering of the jumbo   mortgage threshold from $730,000 to $625,500 on October 1st appears to have had   little effect on the market. Overall, co-op and condo prices remain essentially   flat. New York City's rental market continues to strengthen. Net effective rents   (which take into account landlord concessions that were prevalent a year ago but   are now rare) are up roughly 5 percent from a year ago, with steeper increases   at the high end of the market. Realtors in western New York State note that   market conditions have improved slightly, with sales picking up and prices up   slightly from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets have been mixed since the last report. In New   York City and metropolitan Buffalo, office vacancy rates declined in the third   quarter, while rents moved up. However, vacancy rates rose in Westchester and   Fairfield counties and were little changed across other parts of the District,   while asking rents were generally down modestly. The market for industrial and   warehouse space has not changed noticeably, except in metropolitan Albany and   northern New Jersey, where asking rents are down moderately from a year ago. New   office construction and development remains sluggish, but a number of major   hotel development projects have been announced recently or are already underway   in New York City.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A financial industry contact   notes that securities firms have not been doing well recently, with all major   business lines--including sales &amp; trading, underwriting, and   IPOs--weakening. Declining profits, along with uncertainty about the regulatory   environment, are reportedly causing firms to pull back on hiring and   compensation; some layoffs are also anticipated in this industry the months   ahead. More generally, a major New York City employment agency reports that the   job market has improved a bit since Labor Day but is still sluggish; hiring   activity is described as not terrible but not great--again partly reflecting   weakness in the financial sector. In other sectors, though, labor market   conditions have been steady to slightly stronger since the last report. Two   major retail chains indicate that they plan to hire more seasonal workers for   the upcoming holiday season than in 2010. Both manufacturers and firms in a   variety of service sectors indicate that employment levels have been steady   since the last report, and that they plan to increase headcounts over the next   six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing firms across New York State indicate that their assessment of   general business conditions has deteriorated further since the last report,   although they note that orders and shipments have held steady. Respondents in   that sector anticipate only modest improvement in business conditions and   activity in the months ahead. Manufacturers also note that input price pressures   have moderated somewhat and that selling prices have remained essentially   stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers' responses suggest   increased demand for residential and commercial mortgages and no change in   demand for consumer loans or commercial and industrial loans. Increased demand   was most prevalent for residential mortgages, where three times as many bankers   indicated an increase as a decrease in demand. Much of this appears to reflect   increased refinancing activity. Bankers report some slight tightening of credit   standards for commercial and industrial loans, but in other loan categories,   almost all contacts indicated no change in standards. Respondents report a   decrease in spreads of loan rates over costs of funds for all loan   categories--especially commercial mortgages. Respondents also indicated   widespread decreases in the average deposit rate. Finally, bankers indicate a   modest decrease in delinquency rates for residential mortgages, but a slight   increase in delinquencies for commercial and industrial loans. No change was   indicated in other loan categories.
