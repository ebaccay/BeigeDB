      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 4, 2009
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District  economy weakened further in January and the first half of February. Falling  demand was reported across a broad range of industries, with manufacturers and  energy respondents noting the largest declines. Outlooks remain pessimistic,  and many contacts expect little improvement through year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Contacts in most industries said selling prices were  down. One major exception was the retail sector where prices were recently  holding steady following the winter clearance season. Respondents in the oil  services industry said prices were falling rapidly. Within manufacturing there  were scattered reports of "as-needed" orders, as customers were wary of holding  inventory that was declining in value. Petrochemical prices experienced  significant price declines in January and February as demand and energy  feedstock prices fell. Fabricated metals producers said prices are "falling  like a rock." Across industries, input costs had come down and lower commodity  prices appeared to be flowing through to longer term supply contracts. Fuel surcharges  continue to be reduced but have not completely disappeared.
     </p>
     <p>
      From  January through mid February, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil  fluctuated between $48 and $34 per barrel. An inventory improvement put the  price near $40 as the survey period ended in the third week of February. While  retail diesel prices fell by about 11 cents per gallon, gasoline prices are up  about 25 cents since early this year as demand has strengthened to year-ago  levels. Natural gas prices fell to a six-year low of near $4.00.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets remained weak, and payroll  reductions were prevalent across industries, with the most significant layoffs  noted for manufacturers and energy services firms. Several respondents were  trying to avoid cutting staff by trimming hours and salaries instead. There  were some reports that firms were considering pay freezes for top management.  Staffing firms noted pressure from clients to lower pay rates.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most manufacturers reported declines in  orders and production since the last survey, and outlooks remain  pessimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers  of construction-related manufacturing products said orders continued to fall  over the past six weeks. More than one respondent expressed concern about  whether their firm would make it through the current downturn, and several  noted competitors or customers had gone out of business or filed for Chapter  11. Bookings for residential building materials were down sharply and contacts  reported layoffs and plant closings. Metals producers that supply to the  nonresidential construction sector said orders were unexpectedly low as  commercial activity weakened, the only exception being demand tied to  institutional/public works construction. Outlooks were grim among  construction-related respondents, with most not expecting any improvement this  year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh  District respondents in high-tech manufacturing reported continued declines in production  and orders.Â  Reductions in demand were  widespread across most products and areas of the world. Layoffs and temporary  plant shutdowns have increased since the last survey. Most contacts said they  were aggressively cutting inventories to very lean levels. One semiconductor  respondent expects demand to fall through the first quarter as industries that  use semiconductors in production reduce inventories. While most contacts noted  the outlook remains particularly uncertain, most expect some improvement by  year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand  for paper products was mixed. After falling late last year, orders of  corrugated boxes held mostly steady over the past six weeks, although demand is  below year-ago levels. Manufacturers of printing paper said demand softened  further during the survey period, after accounting for a normal seasonal  slowdown. Inventories were reportedly bloated, and some contacts were reducing  payrolls.
     </p>
     <p>
      Weak  orders for autos and aircraft continue to hamper the transportation  manufacturing sector, yet sales of some specialized products rose. Contacts in  the food processing industry said sales growth of food products has flattened  out, but contacts are satisfied with current levels and expect growth to remain  steady in coming months. Most respondents noted stable prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Refiners'  margins slowly improved from very low levels in December. Contacts said the  last couple of weeks have been quite good, although operating rates were relatively  weak and fell through the survey period. Although petrochemical prices continue  to fall significantly, demand improved slightly in January as customers who had  worked down their inventories began to re-order. Still, contacts said orders  were on an "as-needed" basis only. February has not shown signs of continued  demand improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Retail activity picked up slightly since the  last survey. Contacts were mixed in their explanations for the uptick, but most  suggested that discounts and clearance prices in January lured consumers.  Consumer discretionary spending remained weak overall, but there were some  reports of gains in department store revenues and home products sales. Contacts  said Texas sales were just slightly outperforming the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto  sales held steady at low levels in recent weeks and contacts are hopeful this  signals the bottom. With many incentives already in place prices are not  expected to go any lower. Respondents expect the next 15 months to be tough and  expect several franchise dealers to go out of business in 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing firms said business was worse than  anticipated with orders down sharply for both direct placements and contract  work. Demand was dismal for workers across a broad range of occupations, the  only notable exceptions being sales professionals and workers trained in  mortgage refinancing or collections. Pricing remains competitive and some firms  let go of market share to maintain margins. Accounting firms reported steady  demand--mostly concentrated in tax and audit-related services. Legal activity  weakened since the last survey. The majority of business continues to be  concentrated in litigation and bankruptcy, while corporate, real estate, and  transactional demand remain weak. Bankruptcy-related business has increased,  but not to the levels legal contacts had expected. The general outlook among  service contacts was more pessimistic than reported in the last survey.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eleventh  District-based airlines report demand continues to fall and fares are following  suit. International passenger traffic is down substantially. Most airlines were  re-assessing business strategies. Respondents in intermodal transportation said  cargo volume continued to fall since the last survey, a result of the decline  in demand for imports and the decrease in exports. Large parcel express air and  ground cargos continued to be negatively impacted by poor U.S. retail sales. On  a brighter note, railroad shipments rebounded slightly in recent weeks,  although contacts still expect a difficult year ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Eleventh District financial  institutions characterized loan demand as "disappointing." Several respondents  said that while capital is more readily available for lending, loan demand has  fallen and borrowers that are coming forward are less credit worthy or  unwilling to meet more stringent terms. Lenders continued to set interest rate  floors on the prime rate or price off LIBOR on some loans. Commercial real  estate lending has "dropped off a cliff" over the past few months, and large  loans that are maturing cannot get renewed with the same financial terms.  Contacts said the "hyper-focus" on the value of commercial properties is  creating underwriting problems for even healthy institutions. Lenders said  overall credit standards remain tight and noted somewhat tighter scrutiny for  consumer loans recently. Deposits were stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing conditions in the Eleventh District  remain weak, but there were scattered signs of improvement since the last  survey. After a "horrible" fourth quarter wrought with cancellations and a lack  of sales, homebuilders reported buyer traffic picked up in January and has been  sustained in February. Low interest rates are helping pull potential buyers off  the sidelines say contacts. New home sales picked up since the last survey,  although they are "nowhere near" the level seen in prior years. Several  contacts noted that despite encouraging signs, several smaller builders are  expected to exit the market in the coming months. Margins are squeezed, cash  flow is extremely tight, and financing is difficult--even for legitimate  contracts. Existing home sales continued to decline and median prices edged  lower, although contacts say the level of inventory is low and should continue  to keep price declines minimal compared with the national average. Several  respondents expressed hope that the housing stimulus package would give the  market more time to heal, but some noted parts of the plan were not enough to spur  sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate transactions remain  minimal, yet some contacts noted that "price rediscovery" of real estate assets  was starting to happen. Still, most contacts said uncertainty about the size of  the write-downs was keeping lenders and sellers on the sidelines. Office  leasing activity remained slow but "ok," according to contacts. The outlook for  commercial real estate remains uncertain given that many loans are coming due  amid the difficult financing environment. Contacts expect nonresidential  construction to decline in 2009.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for oil services and equipment is  shrinking rapidly as the U.S. rig count follows energy prices down. The  domestic rig count has lost an unprecedented 697 rigs since the September peak  and 382 since year-end. Texas accounted for 57 percent of the decline this year.  Initially, domestic drilling cuts were concentrated in conventional, vertical drilling,  but more recently the decline is spreading to horizontal, unconventional  natural gas drilling. Respondents said demand for some durable equipment, such  as pumps, drill pipe and bits, is down by 90 percent or more--as these parts can  be cannibalized from rigs taken out of service.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The dry  spell continues to grip much of the District. Wheat and oat crops are suffering  from lack of moisture. Grazing conditions are poor as well, and most ranchers reported  the supplemental feeding of livestock. Hay stocks are low and feed costs remain  high, forcing some ranchers to cull their herds. District dairy producers  report weak conditions. A stronger dollar and weak export demand led to  declines in milk prices.
