      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 27, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Seventh District continued to expand slowly in June   and early July. Contacts expressed heightened uncertainty about the economic   outlook given recent weaker-than-expected demand as well as the ongoing fiscal   issues in the U.S. and Europe. Consumer and business spending edged up.   Manufacturing production continued to expand at a steady pace while construction   remained flat. Credit conditions again improved modestly, despite increased   volatility in financial markets. Commodity prices remained elevated, and there   was further pass-through of these costs to prices downstream. After a late start   to planting, crop conditions began to return to normal, but dryness and   above-average temperatures were concerns for farmers in parts of the   District.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Consumer spending picked up some in   June and early July. Consumers took advantage of retailers' efforts to clear   inventory through early summer promotions. Spending on apparel and accessories   increased as did expenditures on household goods like power equipment and lawn   and garden items. In contrast, auto sales edged lower in June, as incentives   decreased and showroom traffic declined; sales then improved moderately in early   July. Small passenger cars and pickup trucks continued to account for most new   vehicle sales. Inventories of small passenger cars remained lean due to   continued supply disruptions for Japanese vehicles and higher demand for   domestically produced small cars. Demand for used vehicles remained strong, and   with used car inventories relatively low, prices rose further.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Business Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Business spending also edged up from   the previous reporting period. Inventory investment decreased, but expenditures   for equipment and structures increased. Several manufacturers reported plans to   expand capacity, with a number of projects set to break ground in the District   this fall. Renovation of retail facilities picked up further. In addition,   contacts reported an increase in spending on research and development. Hiring   continued at a slow pace, with many manufacturers reiterating the difficulty in   finding appropriately skilled workers. On balance, however, labor market   conditions weakened, as a number of private and public sector layoffs were   reported and unemployment ticked up in the District. Furthermore, a large   staffing firm reported a decline in billable hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Construction activity   remained subdued in June and early July. Construction of new single-family homes   slowed, while the construction of apartment buildings increased. Residential   real estate conditions remained weak. The spring and early summer season saw a   slight uptick in new home sales in the District, which, according to contacts,   tends to be a leading indicator of the sales volume for the remainder of the   year. In addition, although more potential homebuyers are qualifying for   mortgages, contacts noted that downward pressure on existing home prices   continues to restrict the availability of credit for new single-family   construction. In contrast, nonresidential construction edged up with continued   strong demand for industrial facilities, particularly from the automotive   sector, partially offset by continued weakness in office and retail   construction. Commercial real estate conditions also improved, albeit   moderately. Vacancy rates edged lower, with net absorption stabilizing in the   retail segment and rebounding in the office market.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing production continued to   expand at a steady pace from the previous reporting period. Automakers indicated   that production was recovering from the Japanese supply chain disruptions in the   second quarter. Auto inventories remain relatively low, but given recently lower   sales, contacts reported that production would likely recover less sharply than   previously expected. A contact in the auto supply industry noted that production   losses from the Japanese disasters had been smaller than anticipated, but that   efforts to work around supply disruptions resulted in increased expenses for   labor, logistics, and parts, putting pressure on suppliers' margins. Capacity   utilization in the steel industry reached its highest point since 2008;   additional capacity is being added, but at a slow rate. In addition, contacts   reported that steel service center inventories are tight. Several manufacturers   of industrial metals reported increases in orders as well as significant   backlogs in June; however, a few also noted slower activity in recent weeks.   Despite some softening in demand from Asia and Europe, overall demand for heavy   trucks and equipment continued to be strong, driven by fleet replacement and   robust activity in the mining sector. In contrast, shipments of household   appliances declined.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       On balance, credit conditions   improved modestly in June and early July. Funding costs and liquidity tightened   marginally and volatility increased in a number of financial markets. In   addition, contacts expressed concern about the negative consequences that a   potential sovereign default would have on financial markets. Credit availability   continued to improve, though standards remained tight for many borrowers.   Competition among lenders for the highest-quality customers has been stiff,   lowering the cost of capital for these borrowers. Business loan demand was   steady. Businesses continue to mostly refinance existing debt, though a contact   noted that increasingly such deals were also beginning to include an   expansionary element. Consumer loan demand improved, with the pace of   deleveraging by consumers slowing somewhat. The rate of improvement in both   business and consumer loan quality reportedly flattened out.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices and Costs
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Cost pressures remained elevated in June   and early July. Food prices continued to rise, while prices for energy and some   industrial metals, like steel, declined. Despite these recent declines, prices   for many commodities remain elevated, and contacts indicated that fuel   surcharges and shipping costs have yet to come down. Many wholesale prices also   continued to rise, with pass-through of these higher costs to the retail sector   picking up from the previous reporting period. Wage pressures, however, remained   moderate.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       There were mixed changes in crop conditions   throughout the District. A small percentage of acres along the Missouri River   were lost to flooding. Though there was some concern about recent above-average   temperatures, contacts still see the potential for good to excellent corn and   soybean yields this fall, contingent upon favorable weather for the rest of the   summer. Historically low stocks of corn and soybeans have put a premium on   delivery commitments before harvest. On balance over the reporting period, cash   prices for corn, wheat, and cattle were down while prices for soybeans, milk and   hogs prices moved higher; all of these prices, however, remained above the   levels of a year ago. Livestock operations faced margin pressure from high feed   costs. Some elevators were under financial pressures due to expanded margin   calls on their contracted positions as well as higher costs for planned input   purchases for next year's crop.
