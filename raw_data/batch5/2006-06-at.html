      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Sixth District business contacts were mixed in April and May. 
  While most retail merchants indicated that sales rose at a solid pace and expressed 
  an upbeat near-term outlook, some segments reported lower demand. Auto sales 
  were varied, and dealers noted that sales of SUVs and large trucks were especially 
  soft. Residential construction remained steady with sales near year-ago levels 
  in most parts of the District. However, sales weakened in Florida, especially 
  in the condominium market. Nonresidential construction advanced at a modest 
  pace, and factory activity was mixed. Regional transportation companies continued 
  to report strong demand for their services, and Florida's tourism industry 
  posted good results in the spring. Bank loan demand continued to slow in parts 
  of the District. Employers in several industries noted difficulty in obtaining 
  skilled workers. Upward cost pressures were reported in many industries, whereas 
  the ability to pass on these higher costs to customers remained mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most District retail contacts reported healthy levels of sales and traffic in 
  April and May. Total sales were described as being above year-ago levels. Merchants 
  near Katrina-damaged areas continued to report very strong sales because of 
  the influx of evacuees. Inventories were described as a bit heavy overall, but 
  most merchants were still comfortable with their position, and continued to 
  express a positive near-term outlook. The weakest retail reports came from discount 
  retailers and restaurants. District auto sales were mixed in April and May. 
  Dealers noted that sales of SUVs and large trucks were soft, while more fuel-efficient 
  models performed better. Most contacts noted that demand for compact and hybrid 
  models was strong and that inventories were light.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Homebuilders and residential real estate contacts reported that single-family 
  home construction and sales were near year-ago levels in most parts of the District. 
  However, Florida reports noted slowing in both construction and sales in April 
  and May. Inventories of homes for sale in Florida remained higher than at the 
  same time last year. In addition, Florida condominium sales continued to weaken 
  with several project cancellations reported. Florida homebuilder contacts anticipated 
  that new home sales and construction would remain near current levels, while 
  Realtors expected further slowing in home sales. Some parts of Katrina-damaged 
  areas in Mississippi noted a modest improvement in residential construction 
  activity, and some demolition work had begun in the New Orleans area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gradually declining vacancy rates and positive absorption indicated healthy 
  demand in nonresidential real estate markets across the District. However, construction 
  has only picked up modestly according to most contacts. The pace of nonresidential 
  redevelopment in hurricane-hit areas remains modest, although some parts of 
  the Mississippi coast were further along.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained mixed in April and May. Suppliers of construction 
  materials continued to report strong demand. The auto production industry posted 
  varied results. Another foreign auto parts supplier chose a District site for 
  its first U.S. factory which will create 250 jobs. However, lower sales of some 
  large SUVs and trucks have led to production cutbacks at several District assembly 
  plants. Textiles also remained under pressure; a large regional textile firm 
  will permanently close its factories in the District this summer, and approximately 
  2,000 jobs will be eliminated as a result. Several manufacturing firms reported 
  that they were hesitant to move ahead with expansion plans because of uncertainties 
  regarding input prices and future demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong demand for truck and rail services has continued to benefit most regional 
  transportation companies. Generally, pricing has remained firm, allowing most 
  trucking companies to recover part of the higher fuel costs. Driver shortages, 
  especially for long haul truckers, have continued to cloud the otherwise favorable 
  business outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism and Business Travel
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The tourism industry posted positive results in April and May, but the outlook 
  is uncertain. Contacts reported that tourism in South Florida was booming, especially 
  among the five-star properties. Miami hotels reported very strong occupancies 
  and room rates. A record number of people are expected to visit Orlando theme 
  parks by the end of the year. However, Florida tourism officials remain wary 
  as the hurricane season approaches. Some cruise lines out of Miami promoted 
  discounts as much as 20 percent compared to last year's prices on late 
  summer cruises in the Caribbean, reportedly because of hurricane fears.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mississippi's coastal casinos continued to rebound. Mississippi Gulf 
  Coast gaming revenues in April were back to approximately 60 percent of year-ago 
  levels. The largest impediment reported for the tourism industry there is the 
  scarcity of hotel rooms in the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking conditions in the District remained largely favorable. However, loan 
  demand softened in some areas, led by a decline in the volume of mortgage applications. 
  Some contacts also noted slower automobile and C&amp;I lending. By most accounts, 
  credit quality and deposit growth remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts continued to report tight labor markets in many areas. A growing number 
  of employers expressed difficulty in attracting new employees to South Florida, 
  reportedly because of housing affordability issues. A shortage of housing has 
  also hampered labor availability in the Gulf Coast region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most reports note continuing upward price pressures, especially for building 
  materials and energy-related goods. Builders reported that prices for concrete, 
  steel, copper, and zinc continued to move higher. High crude oil prices have 
  pushed up the costs of petroleum-based goods such as PVC, roofing, and asphalt. 
  Several contacts in coastal areas noted higher insurance costs. Despite these 
  pressures, however, the ability to pass on higher costs to customers remained 
  mixed. Slowing demand and strong competition were the most often cited reasons 
  for not being able to raise prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Improved weather conditions helped most District crops. Cotton conditions were 
  generally improved, and sugarcane production is projected to recover from last 
  year's hurricane damage. Meanwhile, poultry prices remained down because 
  of weaker foreign demand. Prospects for oil and natural gas production from 
  the Gulf of Mexico improved as the largest hurricane-damaged platform came back 
  online, and is expected to reach full
      <br/>
      pre-Katrina production levels by the end 
  of June.
