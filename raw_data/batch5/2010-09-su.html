       September 8, 2010
      </strong>

     <p>
      <strong>
       Prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco   based on information collected on or before August 30, 2010. This document   summarizes comments received from business and other contacts outside the   Federal Reserve and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve   officials.
      </strong>
     </p>
     <hr width="600"/>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts suggested continued growth   in national economic activity during the reporting period of mid-July through   the end of August, but with widespread signs of a deceleration compared with   preceding periods. Economic growth at a modest pace was the most common   characterization of overall conditions, as provided by the five western   Districts of St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco. The   reports from Boston and Cleveland also pointed to positive developments or net   improvements compared with the previous reporting period. However, the remaining   Districts of New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago all   highlighted mixed conditions or deceleration in overall economic   activity.
     </p>
     Consumer spending appeared to increase on balance despite continued   consumer caution that limited nonessential purchases, while activity in the   travel and tourism sector picked up relative to seasonal norms. Activity was   largely stable or up slightly for professional and other nonfinancial services.   Reports on manufacturing activity pointed to further expansion, although the   pace of growth eased according to several Districts. Agricultural producers and   extractors of natural resources reported continued gains in demand and sales.   Home sales slowed further following an initial drop after the expiration of the   homebuyer tax credit at the end of June, prompting a slowdown in construction   activity as well. Demand for commercial real estate remained quite weak but   showed signs of stabilization in some areas. Reports from financial institutions   pointed to generally stable or slightly lower loan demand and noted some modest   improvements in credit quality.
     <p>
      Upward price pressures remained quite limited for most categories of final   goods and services, despite higher prices for selected commodities such as   grains and some industrial materials. Wage pressures also were limited, although   a few Districts noted increased upward pressures in a narrow set of sectors   experiencing a mismatch between job requirements and applicant skills.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on consumer   spending were mixed but suggested a slight increase on balance. Most Districts   reported that non-automotive retail sales rose compared with the previous   reporting period or were above their levels from 12 months earlier. By contrast,   Atlanta reported a decline in the level of sales, and Richmond noted that sales   "sputtered" in August, while New York and Dallas reported that growth in retail   sales slowed. Several Districts noted an emphasis on necessities and   lower-priced goods. Boston reported that back-to-school purchases were focused   on immediate needs; in Cleveland, consumers focused on "value-priced seasonal   items;" and in St. Louis, Kansas City, and San Francisco, sales were relatively   stronger for lower-priced items. Spending on big-ticket items such as expensive   consumer electronics was weak according to Philadelphia, Richmond, and Dallas.   Most Districts also reported that sales of new automobiles and light trucks were   largely stable or up slightly during the reporting period, and contacts were   optimistic for stable sales or slight growth over the balance of the year. A few   reports indicated that inventories for various goods remained near desired   levels despite slower sales in some cases, as retailers have been practicing   very tight inventory management.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from most Districts pointed to consistent gains in travel and tourist   activity, with pickups evident in the business and leisure segments alike. New   York reported strong tourist activity that kept hotel occupancy rates high in   Manhattan despite an increase in hotel capacity this year, while Boston noted   that travel and tourism activity was "stronger than expected." Several other   Districts also reported rising visitor counts and hotel occupancies, notably for   popular tourist destinations in the Richmond, Minneapolis, and San Francisco   Districts, although several pointed to continued softness in per-visitor   spending. Atlanta noted reduced tourist activity in areas of the Gulf Coast   affected by the oil spill but improvements over last year in unaffected areas.   Airline traffic was stable to up, with Boston pointing to an expanded number of   low-fare carriers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity was largely stable or up   slightly for professional and other nonfinancial services. Providers of   information technology (IT) services such as computer software saw substantial   revenue and sales gains in the Boston and Kansas City Districts, with increased   demand for IT labor reported in Chicago as well. Demand for professional   services such as accounting held largely steady, with Minneapolis and Dallas   noting increases for selected types of consulting and legal services. Conditions   were mixed for providers of real estate services, as heightened appraisal   activity for refinancing purposes was offset by depressed home sales and   consequent limited needs for agents and brokers. Demand for temporary staffing   services remained on an upward trend, with increases noted by Boston,   Philadelphia, Richmond, and Minneapolis, although Chicago pointed to a slight   softening during the reporting period. Reports from the health-care sector were   mixed: Boston, Cleveland, and Chicago reported ongoing increases in demand for   health-care workers, while Philadelphia indicated a flattening in demand for   health-care services and San Francisco noted a decline in the frequency of   elective procedures and routine tests. Demand for shipping and transportation   services generally expanded, although according to Cleveland the pace of growth   slowed and contacts there expect little change from existing volumes in the near   term.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity expanded further on   balance, although the pace of growth appeared to be slower than earlier in the   year. Most Districts reported further gains in production activity and sales   across a broad spectrum of manufacturing industries. However, New York,   Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago noted that the overall pace of growth slowed,   while Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Kansas City reported that demand softened   compared with the previous reporting period. Recent weakness was most notable   for construction-related products, according to reports from Cleveland,   Richmond, Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco. By contrast, orders and activity   edged up for makers of steel and other metals in Cleveland, Chicago, and St.   Louis, propelled largely by demand from the transportation equipment industry.   Activity among automobile makers and parts suppliers rose further in Richmond   and held steady in Chicago, although it dropped temporarily in Cleveland as a   result of factory retooling. Manufacturing activity for commercial aircraft was   steady in the Dallas and San Francisco Districts, although a contact in Boston   reported that the industry's recovery has been slow. In the Boston and San   Francisco Districts, makers of semiconductors and other high-tech products saw   further sales gains, while Dallas noted that demand held largely steady at   existing high levels. Among nondurable products, food processing stepped up in   Philadelphia and San Francisco. Demand conditions for paper products were mixed,   with increased sales and expansion plans noted in Minneapolis and St. Louis but   flat to declining sales identified in Dallas. Export demand was an important   contributor to healthy conditions in the manufacturing sector according to   Boston and Chicago, notably for heavy machinery and autos.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on capacity utilization were mixed. Manufacturers of high-tech   products have been operating near maximum capacity of late, although this partly   reflects a substantial decline in industry-wide capacity over the past three   years, as noted by Dallas. More generally, the majority of Cleveland's   manufacturing contacts reported that capacity utilization remained below   pre-recession levels. Capital spending plans for manufacturers and firms in   other industries generally indicate little change or modest increases in coming   months, based on reports from the Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in residential real   estate markets declined further. Most District reports highlighted evidence of   very low or declining home sales, which many attributed to a sustained lull   following the expiration of the homebuyer tax credit at the end of June. Some   Districts, such as New York and Dallas, noted that the expiration of the tax   credit created especially weak conditions for lower-priced homes, while others,   including Philadelphia and Kansas City, identified the high end of the market as   the primary weak spot. Residential construction activity declined in most areas   in response to weak demand. Cleveland, St. Louis, and Minneapolis were the   exceptions to this pattern of declining activity, with reports from their   contacts indicating that residential construction activity improved of late.   Inventories of available homes rose in general, although the availability of new   homes in Atlanta was held down by the slow pace of new home construction. Price   movements were mixed, with most Districts reporting stability or declines of   late; a few, notably Boston, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, noted that prices   rose in some areas compared with the previous reporting period or last year.   Richmond reported that recent home sales were "dominated by foreclosure and   short sales," and Chicago reported an increase in the supply of foreclosed homes   for sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for commercial, industrial, and retail space generally remained   depressed. Vacancy rates stayed at elevated levels in general and rose further   in a few Districts, placing substantial downward pressure on rents. Asking rents   continued to decline in parts of the New York and Kansas City Districts. High   vacancies and negative absorption held nonresidential construction activity to   the bare minimum in most Districts. A few Districts reported exceptions to weak   conditions. Cleveland noted improved construction activity for industrial use   and educational infrastructure; this raised overall activity above year-earlier   levels and prompted modest hiring by builders. Chicago reported an increase in   inquiries for commercial redevelopment and rising construction activity for   public projects, but Richmond reported that state and local governments cut back   on construction projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity was stable to down   slightly on net. Most Districts reported little or no change from existing low   levels of commercial and industrial lending, as businesses remained quite   cautious about expansion plans. Dallas and San Francisco reported that overall   lending trailed off, with declines driven by weak business lending stemming in   large part from uncertainty about future economic conditions. Consumer lending   remained sluggish in general, with contacts in Philadelphia and Richmond   emphasizing the role of households' ongoing efforts to reduce their debt   burdens. A recent flurry of refinancing activity spurred increased demand for   residential mortgages in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago, and Kansas City   Districts, but new-purchase mortgage originations remained quite sluggish in   general. A few Districts pointed to increases in nonbank financing activity,   including rising availability of trade credit in Atlanta and further increases   in venture capital funding in San Francisco.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending standards were largely unchanged. However, New York reported tighter   standards in all lending categories, particularly for commercial mortgages, and   Kansas City reported that a few banks tightened standards for commercial real   estate loans. By contrast, reports from Chicago indicated that credit   availability and terms loosened for business and consumer loans. Credit quality   also changed little on balance. Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco noted   modest improvements in overall credit quality, while New York reported rising   delinquencies for all categories except consumer loans and Atlanta reported an   increase in business and household bankruptcies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand for agricultural   products continued to expand, and producers benefited from relatively tranquil   supply conditions. Crops and livestock generally sold well in Districts with   extensive agricultural sectors, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City,   Dallas, and San Francisco. Domestic growers have seen increased demand for   grains and other commodities as a result of shortages overseas. Growing   conditions were supportive of relatively high yields in most areas, although   volatile weather conditions held corn and soybean yields below the record levels   expected earlier in the season in the Chicago District. Low moisture during   parts of the growing season also undermined yields for selected crops in the   Richmond and St. Louis Districts, most notably for corn.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand and extraction activity increased for producers of natural resource   products, including oil and other items used for energy output. Rising global   demand spurred expanded extraction activity for oil, natural gas, and assorted   minerals, as reported by Cleveland, Atlanta, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas,   and San Francisco. In the Atlanta District, oil production was barely affected   by the Gulf oil spill, although contacts noted lingering concerns about the   longer-term business impacts of the deepwater drilling moratorium and higher   liability insurance costs for oil extraction companies.
     </p>
     <strong>
      Prices and   Wages
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Upward price pressures were very limited during the reporting   period, with the exception of selected food commodities and industrial   materials. Philadelphia reported increases in the prices of primary metals and   wood products, Minneapolis pointed to higher prices for copper and lead, and   Dallas and San Francisco reported higher prices for grain and selected other   agricultural commodities. Atlanta reported that commodity and   transportation-related prices rose, but their contacts indicated plans to absorb   the increases into their margins rather than passing them on to consumers.   Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco also noted limited pass-through of cost   pressures to downstream prices.
     <p>
      Wage pressures remained modest overall. Of Districts commenting on wages,   most identified little or no upward pressures or increases. Dallas reported that   wage pressures were "generally nonexistent," with the exceptions of some airline   and temporary workers. Hiring of permanent employees was held down in part by   employers' reliance on temporary and contract workers, as reported by   Philadelphia and Atlanta, although Boston noted that conversions from temporary   to permanent staff picked up. Contacts in the Boston, Chicago, and Kansas City   Districts noted skill mismatches between available jobs and the workers applying   for them, which caused a slight uptick in wage pressures for selected jobs in a   narrow set of industries. More generally, however, the reports suggested ample   supply of qualified applicants for open positions.
