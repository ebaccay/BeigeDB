      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <strong>
      December 1, 2010
     </strong>
     <br/>
     <p>
      The District economy strengthened in October and early November, despite   headwinds from the residential and commercial construction sectors. Additional   gains in consumer spending boosted optimism for holiday sales among retailers   and auto dealers. With moderate gains in October and November, manufacturing   plant managers expected production activity and new orders to rise further with   a pick-up in export activity. Energy and agricultural activity rose robustly   with strong demand, low inventories, and a weaker dollar lifting commodity   prices. In contrast, residential and commercial construction remained weak,   although commercial real estate sales and vacancy rates were expected to improve   in coming months. Banking conditions remained stable with more District bankers   expecting improvements in loan quality. Despite higher raw material prices,   wholesale and retail prices held steady. Wage pressures remained subdued, though   some firms were hiring for seasonal and specialized labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending improved further in   October and November, and contacts were optimistic about future sales heading   into the holiday season. District retailers reported stronger sales with limited   discounting on merchandise. Contacts indicated an uptick in durable goods sales,   especially appliances, while sales of luxury items were slow. After declining in   the last survey period, auto dealers reported a slight improvement in sales,   especially for trucks and used cars. Dealers anticipated demand would continue   to strengthen through year-end, and some planned to hire sales staff and service   technicians. Restaurant traffic was up, while the average check amount declined.   With the end of the summer travel season, average room and occupancy rates edged   down at District hotels, but tourism activity was stronger than expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      After   rebounding in the last survey period, District manufacturing activity continued   to expand, and many firms expected further growth in the next six months. While   production levels varied across industries, some of the strongest gains were at   food, fabricated metal, and electronics manufacturers. In general, new orders,   shipments, and production activity strengthened in recent weeks, contributing to   rising order backlogs and shrinking finished goods inventories. In the next six   months, plant managers expected production, shipments and orders, especially for   export, to strengthen further. In addition, more factory managers planned to   increase staff or make capital purchases in coming months. High-tech firms also   reported a rise in sales that was expected to continue through year-end. After   slowing in the last survey period, activity in the transportation sector   stabilized and some firms noted a shortage of qualified drivers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential and commercial   construction remained sluggish in October and November, while commercial real   estate sales and vacancy rates were expected to improve in coming months. After   contracting with the end of the homebuyers tax credit program, a few District   homebuilders noted a slight uptick in housing starts. Still, District home   prices edged down and sales continued to fall heading into the typical winter   lull in home buying activity. District contacts noted that the starter home   market remained active, but long lead times for selling mid- and upper-priced   homes were boosting inventories and limiting "move-up" opportunities. Mortgage   loan activity rose as homeowners refinanced existing mortgages to lower payments   and shorten terms. Commercial construction activity declined and was expected to   remain weak over the next three months. District commercial real estate contacts   reported little change in vacancy rates, absorption rates, and prices. Some   firms, however, reported an uptick in sales and expected vacancy rates to edge   down in coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported stable loan demand, increased   deposits, and an improved outlook for loan quality in the recent survey period.   Overall loan demand continued to hold steady as demand for commercial and   industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and consumer installment loans   remained stable. In contrast, bankers reported stronger demand for residential   real estate loans. Compared to the previous survey, credit standards remained   unchanged in all major loan categories. Loan quality was essentially unchanged   compared to one year ago. Bankers, however, expected loan quality to improve   over the next six months. Deposits, especially for transaction accounts and   savings accounts, increased after having been flat since late last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions improved since the   last survey period. Favorable weather conditions across the District facilitated   an early corn and soybean harvest with yields less than original estimates but   slightly better than their five-year average. The winter wheat crop was   progressing normally. Crop prices continued their steady climb through the fall   harvest, boosting incomes for crop farmers but raising feed costs for livestock   producers. Farmland values and cash rental rates strengthened further with   higher farm incomes and robust demand for good quality farmland from both   farmers and non-farm investors. Farm operators also increased spending on farm   equipment and grain storage bins. Demand for farm operating loans was steady,   and agricultural bankers reported ample funds were available for qualified   borrowers at historically low interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District energy activity continued at a robust   pace in October and November. The number of active drilling rigs in the District   rose further, primarily due to natural gas expansion in Oklahoma and New Mexico.   Producers expected drilling activity to remain elevated over the next three   months; however some firms reported that equipment shortages, difficulty finding   qualified labor, and availability or cost of financing were constraining   drilling activity. District contacts anticipated a modest increase in natural   gas prices as the winter heating season approached. Crude oil prices were also   expected to strengthen with rising demand and a weaker dollar. After surging in   the last survey period, Wyoming coal production continued apace. With higher   ethanol prices, profits at ethanol plants held steady despite higher corn prices   raising operating costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Prices paid for raw materials rose   further in October and November, but selling prices and wages generally held   steady. District manufacturers reported higher raw materials prices and expected   additional increases in the next six months. They also expressed a limited   ability to pass on higher input costs to current finished goods prices. However,   more factory managers expected to receive higher finished goods prices over the   next six months. Restaurants paid more for food, but kept menu prices stable.   After rising in the last survey, prices for building materials held steady.   Though a limited number of firms were hiring, primarily for specialized labor or   seasonal workers, few were raising wages to attract qualified applicants. Wage   pressures were expected to remain subdued through the end of the year.
