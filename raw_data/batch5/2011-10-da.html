      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 19, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Eleventh District economy continued to expand at a modest pace since the   last report. Manufacturing activity was mixed. Service sector activity held   mostly steady, although retailers noted a recent pick-up in sales. There were   some signs of improvement in the housing sector, and apartment demand remained   brisk. Office and industrial leasing activity continued to increase, but   commercial real estate investment activity fell. Loan demand was mostly   unchanged, according to financial contacts. The energy sector continued to   expand at a strong pace, while agricultural conditions deteriorated further.   Many responding firms across industries noted their outlooks were less   optimistic, reflecting uncertainty about the U.S. and global economies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price pressures eased slightly since the last   report. Most firms said input prices were unchanged or down, although retailers   noted some increases in apparel and jewelry prices. Raw materials prices were   flat or down. The exception was food producers who noted increased prices for   some inputs. Contacts in the agricultural sector said commodity prices moved   down since the last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      The price of WTI held between $80 and $90 per barrel for most of the survey   period, but slipped under $80 by early October. As the driving season ended, the   price of on-highway diesel and gasoline fell by 11 and 16 cents per gallon,   respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Market
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment levels held steady at most   responding firms, although there were several reports of slight hiring activity.   Staffing firms continued to note steady demand at high levels. Most primary   metals manufacturers reported increases in payrolls and some continue to look   for additional workers. Scattered reports of hiring came from contacts in the   legal, auto sales, airline and transportation manufacturing industries. Contacts   in food manufacturing and financial services said hiring activity had abated.   Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward pressure was noted by select   retail, lumber and transportation manufacturing firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports were mixed among   construction-related firms, but most contacts described demand as steady during   the reporting period. Several responding firms said ongoing public projects were   buoying activity. Fabricated metals firms noted a slight pickup in demand and   two lumber producers noted a pickup believed to be due to home improvement   projects and demand from homebuilders. Construction-related outlooks were mostly   unchanged, with a slow recovery expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Respondents in high-tech manufacturing said that sales growth remained   positive but continued to slow and new orders declined. Demand weakened across   consumer and business markets and throughout most regions of the world.   Producers of consumer electronics are reportedly very cautious about demand over   the holidays and into the first half of next year, and have reduced their orders   for semiconductors. Because of the decline in new orders, respondents in the   high-tech sector expect sales to weaken over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from paper manufacturers were mixed. Box producers noted orders from   the food and beverage industry had fallen, but demand from retailers had picked   up. One paper firm said strong demand was leading to lower inventories. Outlooks   were mostly downbeat, due to fluctuations in the stock market and speculation   about another recession. Non-defense transportation manufacturers said demand   held steady at pretty good levels, and is up significantly from a year ago.   Responding firms were cautiously optimistic in their outlooks, noting troubles   at the national level had not impacted them yet. Food producers said sales were   flat since the last report, and outlooks were positive, although firms were not   hiring because of concerns about current U.S. economic conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical demand weakened in September. Ethylene spot prices fell despite   two large plants shutting down. Domestic demand for polyethylene is weak, and   the strong dollar has cut off exports to Asia and Europe. Exports to Latin   America also weakened as Asian producers offered prices low enough to displace   U.S. exports. Refiners said demand for refined products fell slightly as summer   ended. Margins remain strong, but have narrowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Sales
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales growth slowed over most of the   reporting period, but picked up in the final weeks of September. A long hot   summer led to delayed fall clothing purchases, however contacts said cooler   weather recently spurred seasonal sales. The higher end of the market continues   to fare better than lower price point offerings. Eleventh District growth   trended roughly in line with the nation, according to one large retailer.   Expectations are for modest growth this holiday season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile sales were steady with some slowdown in traffic attributed to   economic concerns caused by pessimistic headlines. Despite concerns, customers   continue to buy vehicles. Inventories are somewhat light, but at appropriate   levels for the most part. Used car supply remains constrained resulting in high   prices. Expectations are for a continued moderate pace of sales growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall demand for staffing services continued   to hold steady at high levels. One contact noted a slight pull back that was   characterized as "fear driven." Direct hires continue to outpace temporary   placements. Outlooks were mixed, with half of the respondents more cautious and   half more positive. Even contacts with positive outlooks expressed concern about   the upcoming election cycle and regulatory uncertainty. Accounting firms said   demand for accounting services remained steady. Outlooks were unchanged, but one   contact noted the next few months will be telling, as customers appear to be   waiting for greater clarity about the economy and possible regulations. Demand   for legal services remained unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most transportation services firms said demand held steady or rose, but many   firms' outlooks weakened further since the last report. Intermodal cargo volumes   were flat, and contacts say outlooks are negative for 2012. Railroad firms said   volumes increased during the reporting period, but that the numbers were   somewhat artificially inflated due to capacity coming back online after the   flooding in the northern U.S. Container volumes declined modestly over the past   three months, but picked up in August. Small parcel shipments held steady in   August, but shipping firms have lowered expectations of growth this year.   Airline traffic was reportedly holding up well and has been flat to slightly   improved over the last six weeks in terms of passenger volume. Demand for travel   to Latin America remains strong, and travel to Japan is weak. Airline industry   outlooks are positive, but more uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the housing   sector noted some improvement, although most characterize conditions as choppy.   Inventories of existing homes declined since the last report, and new home   inventories remain lean. Most contacts say sales are better, although many note   the strict lending environment, along with nervousness about the path of the   U.S. economy, is keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment demand continued to rise since the last report, and contacts are   positive in their outlooks. While construction has increased, demand has kept   up, and respondents believe it will be a year or two before much of the new   product is available. Apartment rents continued to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate contacts said demand for office space remained strong   overall during the reporting period, but that in recent weeks clients have   deferred decisions to expand. Demand for industrial space was being spurred by   lease renewals rather than the expansion by existing tenants. Real estate   investment activity declined in August amid uncertainty.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Financial firms reported relatively   flat loan demand overall. National banks noted modest increases in loan demand,   although contacts were uncertain the gains would continue. Regional banks said   loan demand was flat, and loan pricing remained competitive. Still, outstanding   loan quality continued to hold up, according to contacts. The improvement in   lending conditions noted in the last report has stalled, due to both the modest   level of demand and more caution in supplying loans to anyone but the most   creditworthy of borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drilling activity remains strong. Contacts in the   energy sector said oil field activity is at high levels and expanding. The Texas   rig count rose by 11 during the reporting period. Despite the strength, many   noted concern about the recent dip in the price of oil and U.S. and global   economic weakness.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Drought in the Eleventh District remained   severe during the reporting period, particularly in Texas where more than 85   percent of the state is in exceptional drought. Already poor grazing and stock   water conditions deteriorated further, forcing many ranchers to sell off part or   all of their herds. The drought caused low yields and record-high abandonment   rates for some crops, including cotton. Export demand for beef continued to grow   while the volume of exports for most crops was lower than six weeks ago. There   was growing concern about continued drought conditions and the negative impact   of low soil moisture on 2012 crop production.
