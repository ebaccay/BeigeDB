      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

       July 27, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District was expanding in early July. Manufacturers 

  reported increases in orders and shipments compared with June. Retail sales 

  of general merchandise increased compared to the prior month and year. Auto 

  sales remained on the rise following a strong upturn from May to June. Banks 

  reported that lending continued on an upward trend, with gains in business lending 

  and home equity credit. Firms in the District's major service industries 

  reported growth in activity in the past few months about in line with the growth 

  rates they posted earlier in the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District business contacts generally expect business activity in the 

  region to continue to expand at around the current pace. Manufacturers expect 

  increases in shipments and orders during the next six months, although the balance 

  of positive forecasts is not as great as it was during the first half of the 

  year. Retailers anticipate steady sales growth, with moderate year-over-year 

  gains. However, auto dealers are uncertain about the outlook, and some expect 

  the sales rate to decline in the months ahead. Bankers expect continued loan 

  growth near the recent pace. Service sector firms expect moderate, steady increases 

  in business.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the Third District was on the rise in early July according 

  to manufacturing firms contacted during the month. Nearly one-third of the companies 

  contacted posted increases in new orders and shipments compared with June, and 

  around one-fifth had decreases. However, order backlogs were on the decline, 

  and delivery times were unchanged from the prior month, on balance. For early 

  July compared with June, the improvement in business was relatively stronger 

  among firms producing wood products, packaging, and industrial materials. Manufacturers 

  of metals and metal products generally had declines. Makers of other products 

  gave mixed reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, the region's manufacturers expect continued growth in business 

  activity, although positive expectations are not as widespread as they were 

  in the first half of the year. About half of the firms contacted in July expect 

  their shipments and orders to increase during the next six months, and about 

  one-fourth expect decreases. On balance, capital spending plans remain positive 

  among District manufacturers, but the number of firms scheduling increased outlays 

  is somewhat lower than it was during the first half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of price increases from Third District manufacturers outnumbered reports 

  of decreases in early July, although a majority of manufacturing firms reported 

  steady prices for the month. One-third of the manufacturing firms contacted 

  for this report noted increases in input prices from June to early July, and 

  one-fifth raised output prices. Less than one-tenth reported declines in either 

  input or output prices. The number of firms noting increases for the month was 

  about the same as during the second quarter, and lower than in the first quarter. 

  During the next six months about half of the manufacturers contacted for this 

  report expect increases in input prices, and almost one-third plan to increase 

  the prices of their own goods; only a very small percentage expect declines 

  in either input or output prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers generally reported higher sales in early July compared with June and 

  with July of last year. There were gains among most lines of goods, with somewhat 

  better performance for seasonal items, apparel, and home furnishings relative 

  to other merchandise categories. Some merchants noted that shoppers were visiting 

  stores less frequently, consolidating shopping trips in order to economize on 

  gasoline expense. Some store officials also noted an apparent decline in impulse 

  buying by shoppers. Retailers expect sales growth to continue at about the current 

  pace, but they are being cautious in their expansion plans. Several retail executives 

  indicated that rising operating costs were leading them to focus on measures 

  to increase sales at existing stores rather than on opening new stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers in the region generally reported a pickup in sales in June and 

  early July stemming from new price discounts by manufacturers. As a result, 

  inventories have been reduced to more desirable levels. However, dealers indicated 

  that sales of large sport utility vehicles have been declining, and they attribute 

  the sales falloff to high gasoline prices. Dealers expressed some concern that 

  the pace of sales will ease later this year as the impact of recent price cuts 

  wanes.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The volume of loans outstanding at Third District banks rose in the first weeks 

  of July compared with June, according to banks surveyed for this report. Commercial 

  and industrial loans have been increasing. Some bankers indicated that there 

  has been strong growth in lending to construction firms and to manufacturers 

  and other companies with housing-related business. Lending for residential mortgages, 

  home equity loans, and home equity credit lines has been growing, as has credit 

  card lending. Bankers in the District expect continued expansion in business 

  activity in the region, and they expect overall lending to remain on the rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Investment companies reported gains in cash inflows in recent weeks, with 

  about equal growth in purchases of money market, bond, and equity funds. Investment 

  company officials said investor confidence appears to be improving, although 

  both individual and institutional investors continue to believe there remains 

  some risk that financial conditions could deteriorate and economic growth could 

  falter.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most of the Third District service firms contacted in early July reported growth 

  in activity. Information services firms have had some increases in demand, and 

  they have been upgrading their own systems. Among other business services, there 

  has been an increase in activity among basic business support services firms 

  and at temporary employment agencies. Demand for temporary workers has picked 

  up for health care, administrative, and some skilled manufacturing occupations. 

  Some temporary employment agencies also noted more demand for workers this year 

  compared with last year from firms with summer peak activity. Most of the service 

  sector firms contacted for this report expect business to continue to advance 

  at around its current growth rate during the balance of the year.
