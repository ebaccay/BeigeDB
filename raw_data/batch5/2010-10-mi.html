      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 20, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Since the last report, economic growth in the Ninth District has picked up   somewhat. Consumer spending, tourism, services, manufacturing, energy, and   mining saw increases. Activity in the commercial and residential real estate   sectors decreased, while commercial construction remained weak. Meanwhile,   residential construction was mixed and progress in the agriculture sector   slowed. Labor markets showed some signs of picking up; however, overall weakness   continued. Wage increases were moderate, and overall prices remained relatively   level.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending grew   moderately. A major Minneapolis-based retailer reported that same-store sales in   September were up about 1 percent compared with a year earlier. September   traffic at a North Dakota mall was up over 10 percent from a year ago, which was   a surprise following a slight decrease in August, according to the mall manager.   Cooler fall weather seemed to attract shoppers. August sales were up over 10   percent at a Montana mall after a few consecutive months of small gains. August   sales were up slightly from a year ago at a Minneapolis-St. Paul area mall. A   restaurant chain noted that sales were up 3 percent during August and September   from a year earlier. However, a Minnesota-based clothing retailer noted slow   uptake of new merchandise offerings; it expects low single-digit increases in   same-store sales over the next few months. September car sales in Montana were   mixed, according to a representative of an auto dealers association.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity was up from a year ago. Rooms sold at Montana hotels were up   almost 11 percent in August from a year earlier, according to a state tourism   research organization. A tourism official in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan   noted that the summer season finished well ahead of a year ago and that fall   traffic seems to be holding up. Minnesota lodging and campground operators noted   increases in summer business from a year earlier and were more optimistic for   fall tourism than a year ago, according to the results of a state survey. In   addition, attendance at the Minnesota State Fair almost reached last year's   record high.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial construction was   slow. A District manufacturer of commercial building materials said demand was   slowing. The value of nonresidential permits in Sioux Falls, S.D., fell   dramatically in September from a year earlier; in contrast, September commercial   permits increased substantially in Rochester, Minn. Residential construction was   mixed. The value of September residential permits increased 70 percent and 40   percent, respectively, in Fargo, N.D., and the Minneapolis-St. Paul area from a   year ago. Meanwhile, residential permits fell 78 percent and 38 percent in value   in Rochester and Sioux Falls, respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate remained weak. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, about 20   percent of office space and 8 percent of retail space sat vacant in August. A   commercial real estate broker in Fargo, N.D., said activity there was flat at   low levels. Residential construction showed signs of stagnation. August closed   home sales in Minneapolis-St. Paul fell almost 9 percent from a year earlier   while prices decreased nearly 2 percent. In contrast, residential real estate   contacts in Bismarck, N.D., described market activity there as busy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the professional business services   sector increased since the last report. Appraisers and title companies reported   continued strength during September. "We are swamped with great projects,"   commented a design and advertising firm. Information technology consulting firms   noted solid interest from corporate clients. Contacts from firms that advise   small businesses on mergers and sales noted less-than-robust growth during the   past month. Some architects reported a surprising increase in activity: "We've   weathered the storm and now find ourselves in calm waters," commented a large   architectural firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing output was up since the last   report. A September survey of purchasing managers by Creighton University   (Omaha, Neb.) showed strong increases in manufacturing activity in Minnesota and   South Dakota, and slight increases in North Dakota. In Montana, a food   processing company is expanding operations and a jet engine plant plans to build   a facility. In Minnesota, a fishing tackle company recently experienced a big   pickup in demand, a metal fabricator saw increased orders, a dental part maker   noted increased sales and a bed manufacturer's recent sales were up and higher   than anticipated.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy and Mining
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the energy and mining   sectors increased since the last report. Late-September oil exploration   increased slightly from late-August. New wind energy projects are planned in the   Dakotas. Most District mines were operating near capacity. Iron ore production   in Minnesota increased in August compared with July. A Montana copper miner   noted that "we have been doing very well," and the short-term outlook was very   positive.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural activity slowed due to wet   weather. District crops were relatively large and in good condition. However,   the cereal grains harvest in Montana was behind the pace of last year.   Widespread wet conditions delayed some farmers from harvesting their bountiful   crops. In addition, large amounts of rain in late September flooded rivers and   saturated farmland from eastern South Dakota through western Wisconsin.   Meanwhile, prices remained robust for many District agricultural products.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets showed some   signs of picking up; however, overall weakness continued. A department store   chain with locations in Minnesota noted that it expects to increase seasonal   hiring, while another large retailer will soon open a store in Minnesota with   plans to hire about 130 employees. A manufacturer in northwestern Wisconsin   noted an increase in hiring due to stronger orders. Minnesota initial claims for   unemployment insurance were down 20 percent in September compared with a year   earlier. According to respondents to a recent St. Cloud (Minn.) Area Business   Outlook Survey, 19 percent expect to increase staffing levels at their companies   over the next six months while 20 percent expect to decrease staff. In last   year's survey, 15 percent expected to boost hiring while 24 percent anticipated   decreases. In contrast, a Minneapolis-area hospital recently announced plans to   lay off 200 employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage increases remained modest. For example, a county government in the   Minneapolis-St. Paul area will award most nonunion employees a 1 percent raise.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall prices remained level. Minnesota gasoline prices were relatively   stable since the last report. Residential natural gas prices were only about 5   percent higher than a year ago. However, scrap metal and plastic resin prices   increased since the last report.
