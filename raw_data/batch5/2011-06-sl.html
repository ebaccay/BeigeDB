      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Eighth District has continued to expand at a moderate pace   since our previous report. Manufacturing activity has continued to increase   since the previous report, while activity in the services sector has declined.   Retail sales increased in April and early May over year-earlier levels.   Similarly, auto sales increased over the same period. Residential real estate   activity has continued to decline, and commercial and industrial real estate   market conditions have been mixed. Overall lending at a sample of large District   banks saw little change during the first quarter of 2011 compared with the   fourth quarter of 2010.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts reported that retail sales in   April and early May were up, on average, over year-earlier levels. About 48   percent of the retailers reported increases in sales, while 36 percent saw   decreases and 16 percent saw no changes. Roughly 41 percent of the retailers   noted that sales levels were below their expectations, 35 percent reported that   sales met expectations, and 24 percent reported that sales were above   expectations. About 32 percent of the retailers noted that their inventories   were too high, while 20 percent reported that their inventories were too low.   The sales outlook for June and July was mostly optimistic: About 60 percent of   the retailers expect sales to increase over 2010 levels, while 24 percent expect   sales to decrease and 16 percent expect sales to be similar to last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Car dealers in the District reported that sales in April and early May were   up, on average, compared with last year's sales. About 58 percent of the car   dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 29 percent saw decreases and 13   percent saw no changes. About 38 percent of the car dealers noted that used car   sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 21 percent reported the   opposite. Also, about 29 percent of contacts reported an increase in sales of   low-end vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while less than 4 percent   reported the opposite. About 57 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported   that their inventories were below desired levels, while 9 percent reported that   their inventories were too high. The sales outlook for June and July was   generally optimistic: About 58 percent of the car dealers expect sales to   increase over 2010 levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing   activity has continued to increase since our previous report. Several   manufacturers reported plans to open plants and expand operations in the near   future, while a smaller number of contacts reported plans to close plants or   reduce operations. Firms in the tire, powder coating, food, paper, packaging,   machinery, automobile, and ship manufacturing industries reported plans to   expand existing operations and hire new workers. In contrast, a firm in paper   manufacturing announced plans to close a plant and lay off employees.   Additionally, some automobile manufacturers have reduced their production   because of a shortage of parts sourced from Japan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the District's services sector has declined since our previous   report. Numerous casinos in the District have been forced to temporarily close   because of flooding on the Mississippi River. Additionally, contacts in the   telephone call center, health care, business support, and support activities for   transportation industries reported plans to decrease operations in the District   and lay off employees. In contrast, a contact in the nursing care industry   announced plans to expand operations and hire new workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Home sales continued to   decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in   2010, April 2011 year-to-date home sales were down 11 percent in Louisville and   Memphis and 19 percent in St. Louis and Little Rock. Residential construction   also continued to decrease throughout the District. April 2011 year-to-date   single-family housing permits decreased in the majority of the District metro   areas compared with the same period in 2010. Permits decreased 33 percent in   Little Rock, 42 percent in St. Louis, and 25 percent in Memphis and   Louisville.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial real estate market conditions were mixed. Compared   with the fourth quarter of 2010, first quarter 2011 suburban office vacancy   rates increased in St. Louis, decreased in Little Rock and Louisville, and   remained constant in Memphis. The downtown office vacancy rates increased in   Louisville and St. Louis, decreased in Memphis, and stayed the same in Little   Rock. Industrial vacancy rates decreased for Louisville, Memphis, and St. Louis   but increased for Little Rock. Commercial and industrial construction activity   remained slow throughout most of the District. Contacts in Little Rock noted   that commercial construction has remained fairly weak. Contacts in St. Louis and   northwest Arkansas also noted weak commercial construction activity. In   contrast, some contacts in southwestern Illinois and Kentucky noted that overall   construction has increased recently.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks indicates little variation in overall lending   activity in the first quarter of 2011 relative to the fourth quarter of 2010.   During this period, credit standards for commercial and industrial loans   remained unchanged, while demand for these loans ranged from unchanged to   moderately stronger. Credit standards for commercial real estate loans were   unchanged, while demand ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker. Meanwhile,   credit standards for consumer loans remained unchanged, while demand ranged from   about the same to moderately stronger. Credit standards for residential mortgage   loans ranged from unchanged to somewhat tighter, while demand ranged from   moderately weaker to moderately stronger.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Heavy rain and flooding   on the Mississippi River during April and early May slowed down field work and   affected crop conditions in the District. The rates of completion for the   planting of corn, cotton, rice, sorghum, and soybeans were behind their 5-year   average in most District states; crop emergence was generally behind schedule as   well. At least 67 percent of the winter wheat crop was rated in fair or better   condition across the District states. Similarly, 88 percent or more of pastures   were rated in fair or better condition. Monthly coal production for April 2011   was 2.6 percent lower compared with April 2010.
