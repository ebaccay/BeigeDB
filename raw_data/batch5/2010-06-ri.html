      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 9, 2010
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District continued to post moderate gains   across most sectors from weak levels. Manufacturing continued to be a bright   spot, with contacts indicating slow-but-steady expansion across a broad range of   industries. Banks and other services-providing firms, also cited improvements   over the last six to eight weeks, with scattered reports of weaker activity. For   example, several professional services firms reported rising revenues, but an   executive at a large healthcare organization stated that demand was weaker than   expected. The real estate market sent mostly positive signals. In a striking   change from recent months, several contacts noted a pickup in the high end of   the market. Retail sales activity was virtually unchanged in recent weeks, but   auto sales improved. While several temp agencies reported improving demand,   other labor market indicators were weak. Slight increases in commodity and   component prices were noted by manufacturing and services firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales generally flattened in recent weeks,   but there were a few reports of improvement. Department stores overall reported   no change in sales, and retailers in areas with high unemployment indicated that   their sales continued to be held down by jobless customers scrimping on   purchases. However, a retail representative in central Virginia noted an uptick   and said that people were now spending on a wider variety of goods compared to a   year ago when customers were "just buying the bare essentials." In addition,   grocery, home improvement, and garden supply retailers reported accelerating   sales. Auto dealers in West Virginia and South Carolina also reported a pick-up   in sales and said that manufacturers have not been able to gear up fast enough   to keep up with dealers' orders for domestic and foreign nameplates. Other   big-ticket sales remained in a slump, however. Retail prices rose slightly   faster since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenues at services-providing firms rose more   quickly than last month, although a few contacts continued to report weakness.   Transportation services firms reported stronger business, and enplanements rose   at District airports. Executives at trucking firms noted stronger revenues, in   part from the ability to raise prices in some markets. In addition, contacts at   professional, scientific, and technical services firms reported rapidly rising   revenues, and call centers in North Carolina cited expanded hiring. In contrast,   an executive at a large healthcare organization noted that customer demand for   services was "a little soft" relative to plan because the flu season was not as   severe as expected. Services firms related to building construction also   continued to report a down market. Aside from trucking, price changes at   services firms were essentially neutral over the last month, with most contacts   reporting no change in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity continued   to expand. Overall, manufacturers reported that shipments edged higher and new   orders advanced at a solid pace, while employment grew at a slower pace. An auto   parts supplier noted that orders continued to increase more quickly than   expected, which resulted in rush orders for foreign and domestic materials.   Similarly, another manufacturer of automotive components indicated that his   company was still experiencing significant unforeseen demand from the auto   sector. He also noted that his non-auto related business was finally starting to   recover as well. Moreover, a number of lumber companies reported their orders   had increased because their customers were rebuilding inventories. Accordingly,   the increased demand resulted in a small profit for their firms for the first   time since early 2007. A manufacturer of door components reported that revenues   were 10-15 percent above the lows of 2009. Contacts also stated that raw   material lead times had increased. Prices of raw materials increased at a   slightly quicker pace than a month ago, while finished goods prices grew at a   somewhat slower pace than earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Banking activity in the District remained   generally weak since our last assessment. However, several respondents stated   that their lending activity over the last few months was up moderately in at   least some segments of their markets. Consumer lending was described by one   banker as up from earlier in the year and another banker cited increased use of   credit cards. Industrial loans were little changed in recent months, as   businesses kept a tight control on inventory and were cautious about investing   in new equipment. Several mortgage bankers stated that applications dipped after   the homebuyer tax credit expired at the end of April, but one banker noted that   activity recovered in the second half of May. While some bankers saw no   improvement in higher-priced home sales, several lenders reported significant   improvements in that segment from extremely low levels. Credit quality was   little changed, although one banker reported increases in 30-day delinquencies.   Other bankers stated that, on balance, quality was improving because bad loans   were being taken off their books.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate markets across the   District continued to strengthen. While most of the gains were in the low-to-mid   price range, activity inched up for higher priced homes in several areas.   Properties in the mid-to-upper price range sold very quickly in the D.C., area,   with the best sellers in the $800k-$1.1M range. The inventory of unsold homes   there was at its lowest level in eighteen months. Several agents reported   getting multiple offers on properties. Concern that interest rates would rise   once the homebuyer tax credit expired had pushed some people to purchase homes.   House prices held steady across much of the District, but they increased   somewhat over the last 30 days in Fredericksburg, Va., where a shortage of   inventory and multiple contracts were noted.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate agents reported modest improvements since our last   report.
     </p>
     <p>
      For example, vacancy rates for office space in Columbia, S.C., and Charlotte,   N.C., markets decreased due to positive absorption, but were stable in Richmond.   Leasing activity eased in Charlotte and demand was unchanged at a weak level. A   slight pick-up in retail leasing was reported in Richmond. Rental rates remained   stable in most sectors. New construction remained generally nonexistent.   However, a construction contractor reported starting a 100-percent speculative   office building in a suburban area and indicated he would like to start a second   one in the near future. He felt confident that the new buildings would attract   tenants shying away from more urban locations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity along the coast was either   unchanged or up slightly from a year ago, and mountain resorts reported   generally improving conditions. Contacts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina   and in Virginia Beach said that bookings over the Memorial Day weekend were   somewhat stronger when compared to earlier expectations. One contact from the   Outer Banks noted that attitudes were definitely improving. Tourists were   starting to eat out more and attending ticketed events again. While an analyst   in Myrtle Beach indicated that increased promotion was attracting more visitors,   spending levels continued to be quite low. Managers at mountain resorts reported   that holiday bookings were somewhat stronger than last year. They attributed the   increase in reservations to people staying closer to home, which allowed   tourists to spend more at restaurants and events.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District labor markets remained soft,   but temporary employment agents cited recent gains. While several services firms   reported that hiring was picking up, job cuts continued at many retail   establishments. No change in the number of employees was noted in most   manufacturing industries, but several contacts reported cuts in weekly   production hours. A Raleigh contact at a temp agency reported seeing a steady   increase in demand for his clients, specifically in office support positions   where demand had been lagging in previous periods. One respondent stated that   temp employment among District auto- and metals-related manufacturers improved   recently. Most temp agency contacts expected the demand for workers to continue   to improve, citing a recovering economy and higher manufacturing orders. Wage   growth picked up in retail and services businesses, but one executive said that   manufacturing wages had not increased since 2007 and he did not expect them to   change this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rainfall brought much needed relief and   improved soil moisture to most areas of the District, which helped revive   pastures and field crops. However, dry conditions and inconsistent weather took   a toll on crops and yield potential in other areas. For example, farmers   expected low rainfall to reduce winter wheat harvests in South Carolina. An   analyst in Virginia reported some fruit and vegetable damage due to near   frost-level temperatures. Also farmers expected lower yields of hay because   sporadic rainfall hampered production and curing. In Maryland, however, hay   supplies remained adequate and pasture conditions were rated fair to good. In   North and South Carolina, plantings of peanuts and soybeans were well on their   way, and farmers in Virginia were busy planting sweet corn, cantaloupes, peppers   and squash. The 2010 peach harvest has just begun in South Carolina and   conditions are favorable for peach growers. Lastly, peach and apple conditions   in West Virginia ranged from fair to excellent, with most orchards in good   condition.
