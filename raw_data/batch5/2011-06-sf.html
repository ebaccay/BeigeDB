      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 8, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Twelfth District economic activity continued to expand at a moderate pace   during the reporting period of late April through the end of May. Price   increases for final goods and services remained limited, and upward pressures on   wages were subdued on balance. Sales of retail items rose further, while demand   for business and consumer services was mixed. District manufacturing activity   also was mixed but appeared to expand overall. Agricultural producers reported   strong sales, and extraction activity rose for providers of natural resources   used for energy production. Activity in District housing markets remained   lackluster, while demand for commercial real estate showed signs of improvement.   Contacts from financial institutions reported further increases in loan   demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Wages and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Price inflation was limited for most   final goods and services during the reporting period, with the notable   exceptions of food and gasoline. Although the prices of a wide range of   commodities and raw materials remained elevated, the pass-through to final   prices has been limited. For most retail goods and services, tepid demand and   robust competition continued to hold down final prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upward wage pressures were quite modest in general. Although hiring activity   has picked up, high unemployment and ample labor availability continued to limit   the pace of overall compensation gains throughout the District. The primary   exception continued to be workers with specialized technical skills,   particularly engineers and specialists in information technology, for whom wage   gains remained significant in several parts of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail Trade and Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retail sales rose further on   balance. Although consumers' focus on necessities continued, the reports noted a   slight shift back toward discretionary spending. Modest improvements in sales   were reported for discount chains as well as for traditional department stores,   and inventories generally were at or near desired levels given the pace of   sales, enabling many retailers to reduce their reliance on promotional   activities. For retailers of big-ticket items such as major appliances and   furniture, however, sales remained somewhat weak. Similarly, sales were largely   flat for grocers. Demand for new automobiles continued to strengthen, although   sales growth was restrained somewhat by high fuel prices and shortages of new   Japanese-made vehicles associated with the recent natural disaster in that   country. The availability of used vehicles tightened further, primarily for   imported models, which has propped up their sale prices and trade-in values.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for business and consumer services was mixed. Providers of   professional services such as legal and accounting reported little change in   activity since the prior reporting period. Sales growth remained strong in the   Internet and digital media sectors, and demand for electricity by businesses and   households expanded further. Activity waned somewhat for providers of   transportation services, with contacts noting a slowdown in cargo traffic at   Southern California seaports. Health-care providers noted further moderation in   the demand for their services. Travel activity continued to improve in much of   the District, reflecting growth in business travel as well as tourism.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity posted   further net gains during the reporting period of late April through the end of   May. Manufacturers of semiconductors and other technology products reported   continued growth in new orders and sales as well as high levels of capacity   utilization, with few supply constraints arising from the crisis in Japan.   Activity fell slightly for metal fabricators, as demand growth eased in the wake   of strong gains in preceding months. Production rates remained solid for makers   of commercial aircraft and parts, with modest growth in new orders adding to an   existing order backlog. Capacity utilization rates dropped a bit for petroleum   refiners, as domestic demand for gasoline stalled in response to elevated   prices. Reports from food and beverage manufacturers indicated that demand for   their products was largely stable or up somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of   agricultural products were robust, and extraction activity of natural resources   used for energy production expanded further. Orders and sales continued to grow   for a wide variety of crop and livestock products. However, contacts noted some   supply constraints: input costs have risen overall, and unseasonably cold   weather delayed the development of some crops in California and the Pacific   Northwest. Demand for natural gas continued to expand, propelled in part by cold   spring weather, and oil extraction activity grew further in response to rising   overseas demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand in District   residential real estate markets was largely unchanged at very low levels, while   conditions improved slightly in commercial real estate markets. The pace of   sales for new and existing homes in the District continued to be very weak on   net, with distressed properties and entry-level homes reportedly dominating the   sales mix in some areas. As a result, new home construction remained moribund   and home prices were stable to down. By contrast, conditions continued to be   stronger in apartment markets, particularly in the Seattle area: rental rates   there reportedly are growing at an annual rate of 10 to 15 percent, spurring   significant increases in construction activity. Vacancy rates for office and   industrial space stayed elevated throughout the District, but further   improvements in demand were noted for several major markets. This was   particularly the case in the San Francisco Bay Area and Seattle, with revived   developer interest in new construction reported for the latter area.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Institutions
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand and overall credit quality rose modestly   since the last reporting period. Businesses in some areas have exhibited a   slight increase in their willingness to engage in expansionary capital spending,   which caused demand for commercial and industrial loans to rise. Demand for   consumer credit remained largely stable. Despite improvements in overall credit   quality, lending standards remained relatively restrictive for many types of   consumer and business loans. However, contacts reported that competition among   lenders to extend credit to well-qualified small and medium-sized businesses has   continued to intensify, placing downward pressure on rates and fees. Contacts   also pointed to continued growth in venture capital financing activity, driven   primarily by investments in the Internet and digital media sectors.
