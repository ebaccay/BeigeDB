      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 6, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Fifth District improved modestly since our last   assessment. Retail sales were sluggish, held back in part by weak big-ticket   sales. Growth at services firms slowed, although tourism businesses reported   strong demand. Bankers said that lending grew slowly, and much of the activity   was refinancing. Residential real estate agents noted encouraging signs of   improvement in housing sales, while commercial Realtors described leasing and   construction activity as mostly flat to moderately up. Manufacturing reports   were mixed, with auto and other transportation equipment-related producers   continuing to do well, while other producers faced unchanged or weakening   demand. District hiring activity varied, with some businesses reluctant to hire   or unable to find qualified workers. Recent rainfall aided newly planted fields,   but excess moisture in some areas delayed planting. Price increases--both paid   and received--generally slowed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      We received mixed signals on manufacturing   activity since our last report. According to our latest survey, new orders and   shipments were essentially unchanged in May, following solid expansion during   the previous month. A producer of metal extrusions reported that, although his   sales slowed a bit in April, demand in May picked up again. However, a producer   of gas turbines said that economic problems in Europe led to fewer exports, and   he expected to lay off ten percent of his employees this summer. Several   manufacturers cited decreased government spending as the primary reason for   recent cancellations of orders. A manufacturer of aircraft engines expected that   cuts in defense spending would soon weaken government demand for his products,   but private sector orders remained robust. A spokesperson at another aerospace   manufacturing firm said that her business was expanding nicely, and she   attributed the increase to strengthening demand for helicopters and gyroplanes.   According to our latest survey, both raw materials prices and finished goods   prices grew at a somewhat slower pace than a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales were tepid in recent weeks, after an early   Easter pulled some holiday sales into March. Stores reported good Mothers Day   sales, although foot traffic was lighter than normal for many retailers. Shopper   traffic was unchanged since our last report and big-ticket sales declined,   according to a recent survey. A central Virginia retail representative reported   little stability in the market as customers exhibited "yo-yo spending" (i.e., up   one month, down the next). Accordingly, retailers managed inventories tightly   and were reluctant to make capital investments. A South Carolina grocer observed   that customers were buying special sale items at different stores, rather than   shopping at one store. In contrast, an executive at a chain of hardware stores   noted that sales had improved at a slow-but-steady pace since the start of the   year. Discount department store managers generally reported a pick-up in sales.   For a few discounters, however, the opening of new competition kept sales flat.   Automobile sales were also flat. Most home improvement retailers reported a   decline in sales in recent weeks. Retailers' prices rose at a somewhat slower   pace since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Revenues advanced more slowly at services firms   since our last report. A building contractor stated that consumers were still   avoiding big projects, but were increasingly looking for "more than a coat of   paint," as homeowners improved their current homes rather than trying to sell.   Several services providers, particularly architectural, engineering, and   telecommunication firms, reported stronger revenues. A healthcare provider in   Central Virginia reported that demand for in-patient services had flattened out   a bit recently, partly due to an absence of influenza cases, but out-patient   services were still growing. Several healthcare institutions reported that they   were continuing capital spending projects, especially on computer technology, to   meet federal requirements and guidelines. Non-retail services providers reported   a mild up-tick in the rate of price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity increased modestly across most   segments of the market. On the commercial side, several bankers cited markedly   higher volumes of small business loan applications and increased loan approval   rates. One banker attributed the gains to growth in inventory and capital   improvement spending, while another said that small businesses were making   renovations to commercial properties. However, several loan officers around the   District saw little improvement in loan demand from the retail sector. On the   consumer side, mortgage demand continued to improve, although refinancing   dominated much of the lending. Other bank officials noted solid gains in home   improvement loans, with one banker citing an increase in use of equity lines of   credit. In contrast to the more upbeat reports, several officials at mid-sized   banks described loan demand as flat in recent months, with little new business   in the pipeline for either mortgage or commercial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate activity generally   improved since our last report. A Realtor in the Richmond area, who noted some   improvement in April, said that May would be a big indicator of whether the   spring market just came early, or if gains would continue into June. He was   cautiously optimistic that real estate activity was moving in a positive   direction. A source from the Hampton Roads area of Virginia said that   housing-related activity in that area had seen recent signs of improvement,   adding that properties were being "snapped up" as investors became more   confident of a housing recovery and home sellers became more realistic with   their prices. Moreover, several brokers in Asheville and Raleigh, North Carolina   stated there was an up-tick in housing sales. However, an agent in the   Winston-Salem area of the state mentioned that there was still stagnant growth   in some areas, and that homes for sale in that area were out of balance with   area incomes. Several Realtors reported that sales picked up in recent weeks,   while housing prices dropped. Most Realtors indicated that sales were   concentrated in the low-to- mid-price range.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate leasing and construction was flat or moderately   improving in recent months, although pockets of weakness persisted. Respondents   around the District reported more construction and absorption, especially in the   industrial segment. Contacts at several engineering and architectural firms   confirmed that interest in new construction projects increased, although demand   remained well below pre-recession levels. Construction activity in South   Carolina was driven by the recent expansion of manufacturing activity in the   state, while gains in West Virginia were associated with the emerging boom in   natural gas. One real estate developer in Charleston, South Carolina said that   rents had increased to the point where "new construction is starting to make   sense." A developer in the Richmond area cited a rise in demand for warehousing   space, related to healthcare facilities and an increase in on-line shopping   activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Assessments of labor market activity were   mixed since our last report. Several employment agency contacts saw somewhat   greater demand for temporary workers, and most expected demand to remain strong   for the remainder of the year. A Baltimore agent reported an increase in demand   for manufacturing workers, adding that manufacturers were hurt by a severe   shortage of trained workers. Several contacts said that current hiring was   focused on skilled positions, and they expected that companies would continue to   experience recruitment problems. However, a representative at a Richmond   staffing agency reported that job orders continued to be steady and that more   area companies were hiring workers on a permanent basis than a year ago. A   source in South Carolina noted that the aerospace industry was investing heavily   in new technologies that would reduce the need to hire additional workers.   According to our latest survey, District wage gains in manufacturing were   slightly lower than a month ago, while the pace of wages in the service sector   increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourism contacts reported strong bookings during   the last four to six weeks, and restaurants in tourist areas experienced solid   customer demand. Several hotel owners on the outer banks of North Carolina said   that spring got off to a strong start and summer rentals were up. Memorial Day   is the traditional summer kick-off for resorts, and most were advertising   special events for that weekend. A resort owner in the mountains of Virginia   said that he expected a record crowd for the holiday. He added that lower gas   prices and good weather boosted bookings in recent weeks, following a winter   season with weak demand due to unusually warm weather. In addition, time-share   rentals were strong, and booking incentives were no longer necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Rainfall across the District supplied   much-needed moisture to emerging field crops. In South Carolina, cotton planting   was slightly ahead of schedule, and planting of peanuts was well ahead of its   normal pace. However, rainfall delayed plantings of cotton and peanuts in parts   of North Carolina and Virginia. Excess precipitation was also problematic for   strawberry farmers in Virginia, causing fruit spoilage; the problem was   compounded by a lack of pickers. Corn and soybeans began to emerge in Maryland,   while farmers in West Virginia reported that warm weather put planting of corn   and soybeans ahead of schedule. Lastly, the peach harvest was under way in South   Carolina, and cantaloupe and watermelon planting was complete.
