      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 2008
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the  Federal Reserve Districts suggest that economic activity remained generally weak  in late April and May.  Three Districts  described economic activity as softer, weaker, or lower, with an additional  four Districts reporting slower, sluggish, or modest economic growth.  The remaining five Districts of Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Atlanta,  St. Louis, and San    Francisco described activity as stable or little  changed in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending  slowed since the last report as incomes were pinched by rising energy and food  prices.  Higher energy prices also appeared  to damp domestic tourism.  Reports on  nonfinancial services varied across Districts and industries.  Manufacturing activity was generally soft in  recent weeks, with weak demand for housing-related and some other products but  with increasing demand for exports.   Residential real estate markets remained weak across most Districts.  Commercial real estate conditions varied  across Districts, as did reports on nonresidential construction activity.  Lending activity also varied across Districts  and market segments, though tighter credit standards were reported for most  loan categories.  Districts reporting on  the agriculture and energy sectors noted improved crop conditions and increased  drilling and extraction activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports of higher  input costs were widespread.   Manufacturing contacts in several Districts noted some ability to pass  along higher costs to customers.   Retailers reported mixed results with respect to raising final goods  prices.  In most Districts, wage  pressures were reported as moderate or limited for all but a few skilled-labor  positions, as hiring activity remained spotty in most Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Consumer spending slowed further since the  last report.  Contacts in several  Districts said rising energy and food prices contributed to softer sales in  other categories.  The overall pace of  retail sales moderated in the Districts of Philadelphia, Richmond,  Atlanta, St.    Louis, Minneapolis,  Dallas, and San    Francisco, and was level in Cleveland,  Chicago, and Kansas    City.  Retail  sales reports were mixed in Boston  and New York.  According to contacts, retail inventory  levels were generally higher in the Atlanta District and among some types of  stores in San Francisco; some  establishments in the New York, St.    Louis, and Richmond Districts expressed concerns about  inventory levels.  In the Boston District  retail inventories were stable.   Employment was on the whole unchanged at Boston District retailers,  whereas retailers in the Cleveland District said they were only hiring for new  stores, and Richmond District retail contacts reported job cuts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports  on overall sales of automobiles and light trucks were weak, with several  Districts indicating that sales of trucks and SUVs declined.  Although dealers generally struggled to move  vehicles off of their lots, contacts in the Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago Districts  reported solid sales of hybrid and other fuel-efficient vehicles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity  varied across Districts.  New    York contacts said that tourist activity had  softened, noting lower attendance at Broadway theaters. San    Francisco reported weaker hotel bookings in Southern   California and in Hawaii,  but record hotel occupancy rates in parts of Alaska.  Higher gasoline prices appeared to weaken  tourism activity in the Chicago District, but increased activity at some  resorts in the Richmond District as families took vacations closer to home.  International visitors boosted tourism  activity in the Atlanta and Dallas  Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Nonfinancial Services
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports from nonfinancial services  industries varied among Districts.  New    York and Minneapolis  reported weaker business conditions while contacts in the Richmond District  reported slower revenue growth, except in telecommunications.  Demand growth for service providers slowed in  the San Francisco District.  Demand at  services businesses in Boston and Chicago,  however, was mixed and the pace of business spending was little changed in the  Chicago District.  Meanwhile, demand in  the service sector generally strengthened in St. Louis  and Kansas City.  Staffing agencies in the Richmond District  reported somewhat weaker demand overall, while staffing agencies in the Chicago  and Dallas Districts said that demand was stable.  In transportation services, intermodal  shipments edged down in the Atlanta  and Dallas Districts, while freight service growth was flat in the Cleveland  District.  Reports on air travel remained  strong despite route reductions, according to contacts in the Kansas City  Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      In service sector  labor markets, Chicago reported a  slower pace of hiring in recent weeks and Minneapolis  reported that employment in professional services companies decreased from a  year ago and is expected to remain flat over the next year.  Cleveland  and Richmond reported little net  change in services employment, while contacts in the St. Louis District said  that expansion at firms in some services industries will lead to additional  hiring.  Boston  and Dallas noted tight labor  markets for some skilled workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Manufacturing activity was generally soft  since the last report.  Boston,   New York, Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago  reported that activity had weakened, although St. Louis,  Minneapolis, Kansas  City, and Dallas indicated that  activity had increased slightly.  Philadelphia,  Cleveland, and San    Francisco described factory activity as nearly  steady.  Reports of softer demand for  housing-related products continued to be widespread.  Many Districts cited higher production costs  and cuts in employment that contacts attributed to slumping home sales and  construction.  The Atlanta  and Chicago Districts indicated that automotive production or sales fell short  of expectations, while the Cleveland District saw an uptick in the production  of domestic nameplates.  Reports on food  processing were mixed with some Districts indicating that higher prices had  constrained demand, while others noted rising demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Industries  demonstrating increased activity were boosted, in part, by a strong overseas  market.  Cleveland,  Atlanta, Chicago,  and Dallas reported that the demand  for steel was strong.  The output of energy-related  equipment
      <strong>
      </strong>
      increased in the Boston,  Cleveland, Atlanta,  and Dallas Districts, while strong sales of farm equipment boosted demand for  manufacturers of heavy equipment according to Chicago  and San Francisco.  Dallas  also reported strong demand for transportation equipment to supply defense and  aircraft industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and  Construction
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Residential real  estate markets were generally weak across most of the nation.  District reports indicated flat or declining  home sales in Boston, New York,  Cleveland, St.    Louis, and Dallas,  and contacts in Philadelphia did  not expect housing activity to expand strongly this year.  Contacts in San    Francisco reported that housing markets remained  exceptionally weak, although a few reports pointed to some recent pickup in  home sales attributed to increased affordability.  Scattered reports from Philadelphia  and Kansas City indicated seasonal  improvements.  Inventory levels of new  and existing homes remained high or were rising in New    York, Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Richmond,  and San Francisco.  Home sales prices decreased somewhat in Boston,  Atlanta, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, but  remained relatively stable in Richmond  and Chicago.  The New York  and Chicago Districts noted that some potential buyers had difficulty in  obtaining financing.  Residential  construction declined in Chicago, St.    Louis, and Minneapolis,  but was flat to slightly higher in parts of the Atlanta District and spiked in  areas of the Dallas District where demand for apartments was solid.  Homebuilders in Cleveland  expected no improvement in the housing industry for the remainder of 2008, and Chicago  reported that limited credit availability for new developments had caused many  builders to suffer losses on existing projects.   Richmond and San    Francisco noted an increase in home foreclosures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real  estate conditions varied in April and May, with some Districts reporting that  activity had softened.  Leasing activity  eased in Boston, New York,  Philadelphia, Richmond,  and San Francisco.  Minneapolis,  however, reported that market activity was up modestly, while activity was  mixed across the St. Louis District.   Vacancy rates edged higher in Boston, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, as well as  in pockets of the Richmond and St.  Louis Districts.  Absorption was negative  in Boston and in Minneapolis  for both office and manufacturing space.   Overall rents were on the rise in New York,  but were stable or beginning to slip in Boston,  Philadelphia, Richmond,  and Kansas City.  Sales trended downward according to the New    York, Philadelphia,  and Kansas City Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on  nonresidential construction activity were mixed.  Contacts from Chicago  and Minneapolis saw slight  increases in activity.  Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Richmond,  Atlanta, and Dallas,  however, reported easing or weak levels of construction.  A number of Districts--Cleveland,  Richmond, Chicago,  and Dallas--reported that  obtaining financing remained difficult for some projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Reports on lending activity varied across  Districts, although reports of softening in the consumer segment  persisted.  Overall loan demand cooled in  Richmond, Atlanta,  St. Louis, and San    Francisco, while Philadelphia  and Cleveland saw a modest increase.  New York reported little change  in demand across all categories, while lending activity in Chicago  was mixed.  Residential lending activity  remained generally weak in Richmond,  Atlanta, and Chicago.  In contrast, demand picked up in Philadelphia,  Cleveland, Kansas  City, and Dallas, but was about the  same in St. Louis.  Commercial and industrial lending activity  was mostly unchanged or declining in New York,  St. Louis, Kansas  City, and San Francisco, while Philadelphia,  Richmond, and Chicago  saw slight increases. Atlanta  reported commercial lending activity as mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The  New York, Philadelphia,  and Cleveland Districts reported increases in overall delinquencies, with  respondents in New York  indicating a notable rise in late payments for consumer loans.  Credit quality deteriorated further in San    Francisco, but began to stabilize in Chicago and  Dallas.  Contacts in Kansas    City and Dallas  expected loan quality to deteriorate going forward. All Districts reporting on  credit standards noted further tightening for consumer, residential, and  commercial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Despite less-than-ideal weather, crop  conditions generally improved for most reporting Districts.  Reports from the Richmond,  Chicago, St.    Louis, and Minneapolis Districts indicated that the  combination of cooler-than-normal weather and wet conditions delayed planting  and development of many crops.  St.    Louis said that planting of major crops was behind its  five-year average pace, while Minneapolis  noted delayed planting and development of corn and soybeans. Richmond  and Chicago reported that some crops  would require replanting, although Chicago District contacts expected small  losses in yields.  Despite weather  delays, Kansas City noted that corn  planting was almost complete, soybean planting was in progress, and the winter  wheat crop was in good condition.   Chicago and Dallas cited high input costs and price movements for corn  as factors leading farmers to shift production away from corn towards soybeans.  Dairy and livestock producers in the Chicago  and Kansas City Districts voiced concerns that rising feed costs were eating  into profit margins.
     </p>
     <p>
      <br/>
      Activity  in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the Minneapolis,   Kansas City, Dallas,  and San Francisco Districts.  Cleveland  said that energy producers reported a pickup in oil and gas drilling, and Minneapolis  indicated that robust oil and gas exploration and production continued in their  District.  Kansas    City noted that the number of active drilling rigs  surged since the last survey period and remained well above year-ago levels.  San Francisco  reported that oil and natural gas extraction expanded further in response to  growing demand, but that activity had been constrained slightly by a shortage  of equipment and materials. In contrast, Dallas  noted that high oil and natural gas prices had pushed drilling to the highest  level in 20 years without any shortages of equipment and services to date.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices  and Wages
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Business contacts in most  Districts reported increases in input prices since the last report, especially  prices for energy, petroleum derivatives, metals, plastics, chemicals, and  food.  Manufacturing contacts in several  Districts reported some ability to pass along the higher costs to customers and  contacts in the Cleveland District noted that they are considering additional  price increases in the near future if input costs continue to rise.  On the other hand, contacts in the Cleveland,  Atlanta, and Chicago Districts  noted falling or stable prices for certain goods related to the construction  industry.  Retail price reports were  mixed, with contacts in the San Francisco District reporting subdued price  pressures for most products save food and energy-intensive goods.  Contacts in the New York District reported  steady retail prices with somewhat more aggressive discounting.  However, retail contacts in the Richmond  and Kansas City Districts reported higher prices, while retailers in the  Chicago District reported increased pressure to pass along higher food and  energy prices.  Contacts in the Kansas    City and Dallas Districts cited expectations for  higher retail prices in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business contacts  in most Districts reported moderate or limited wage growth in response to some  loosening of labor market conditions.   Contacts in the Boston, Chicago,   Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts  noted wage pressures for certain skilled labor positions in industries facing  worker shortages.
