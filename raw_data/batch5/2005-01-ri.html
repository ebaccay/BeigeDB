      Beige Book Report: Richmond

     <p>
      The Fifth District economy expanded at a quicker pace than in our last report, 

  led by firmer conditions in manufacturing and an increase in retail activity 

  in late December. District retailers generally reported that sales growth picked 

  up the pace after mid December and was particularly strong in the final week 

  of the month. Services providers reported moderate growth in both revenues and 

  employment, and major services sectors such as real estate and tourism remained 

  strong. Despite continued contraction in textiles, overall District manufacturing 

  output was little changed in December after having dipped in November. Bank 

  lending was also generally steady in the period since our last report. There 

  were fewer reports of spiraling raw materials prices in the manufacturing sector 

  and prices of manufactured goods rose only modestly. In agriculture, small grains 

  and livestock were in good condition in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District retailers reported that a surge in sales in the final week of the month 

  offset sluggish activity early in the month, boosting their December revenues. 

  A manager at a department store in central North Carolina said holiday revenues 

  were strong. Sales at building supply stores were notably higher--a contact 

  in Richmond, Va., said customer traffic picked up in December while a retailer 

  in Columbia, S.C., reported record sales for the month. Most automobile dealers 

  in the District indicated revenues were about the same as a month earlier. Stronger 

  sales led retailers to increase hiring, and wage growth accelerated. Respondents 

  said that prices rose only modestly at stores in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Demand at services firms was somewhat stronger since our last report. A financial 

  services contact in Baltimore, Md., said the general outlook of "the man on 

  the street" had brightened. A commercial and residential landscaper in coastal 

  North Carolina said his business had "done a 180" in the last four weeks, and 

  that sharply higher customer demand was helping to rein in excess inventory 

  accumulated earlier in the season. Despite the pickup in demand, services employment 

  rose at a slower pace in December, though wage growth gained strength. Prices 

  in the services sector grew at a slightly slower pace in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District manufacturing activity stabilized in December after slipping somewhat 

  in November. Factory shipments and new orders were flat while manufacturing 

  employment edged higher. Several sectors reported generally higher levels of 

  manufacturing activity but these gains were tempered by continued weakness in 

  the textile and apparel sectors. A rubber products manufacturer in South Carolina, 

  for example, told us that December sales were "better than forecast" and added 

  that sales "looked good for the next 30 to 60 days." A plastics manufacturer 

  in North Carolina reported "activity is good" and that "backlog, sales and work 

  activity" were all up at his company. But textile and apparel producers reported 

  softer new orders and lower employment in December. Textile and apparel firms 

  expressed concern that the removal of textile and apparel quotas on China could 

  constrain orders in 2005. Prices of raw materials and finished goods rose at 

  a slower pace in December. Looking ahead, though some manufacturers expressed 

  skepticism about the sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery, many said 

  they planned to increase capital spending over the next six to 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District bankers reported that loan demand changed little since our last report. 

  Lenders said that demand for commercial loans slowed in December, but the slowdown 

  was about normal for the holiday season. Several commercial bankers noted modestly 

  higher capital spending by their clients, particularly for new equipment, and 

  expressed optimism that increased capital spending would drive commercial lending 

  activity higher in 2005. In addition, there were scattered reports of stronger 

  commercial real estate lending in Virginia. Residential mortgage lending was 

  only modestly higher, however; new mortgage originations rose, but refinancing 

  activity dwindled. Bankers reported little change in loan standards for creditworthiness 

  since our last report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Fifth District real estate agents continued to report generally strong housing 

  markets. In Fairfax, Va., an agent said properties were being "snapped up" as 

  soon as they hit the market, adding that she expected an even stronger market 

  in the spring. A Fredericksburg, Va., agent reported a "still crazy" market 

  there, noting that business at her agency was double year-ago levels. In Greensboro, 

  N.C., an agent reported an "active market" and said that the future was expected 

  to be even brighter as a new computer manufacturing facility brought additional 

  jobs to the area. There were a few softer markets, however; agents in Odenton, 

  Md., and Greenville, S.C., for example, reported some slowing in the pace of 

  home sales. Home prices continue to rise in most areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate agents reported that commercial leasing activity strengthened 

  over the final six weeks of 2004. "We ended the year on a very strong note and 

  are quite optimistic we can maintain that momentum well into 2005," noted a 

  contact in Charlotte, N.C. Office leasing was the driving force behind the recent 

  surge in activity as retail and industrial leasing were generally flat. An agent 

  in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area reported that the uptick in office 

  leasing was due primarily to the expansion of "large companies into large spaces." 

  There were scattered reports of increased office construction across the District, 

  while the pace of retail construction was reported to be moderating. Rents and 

  vacancy rates in the commercial sector were little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tourist activity picked up in the weeks since our last report. A contact on 

  the Outer Banks of North Carolina noted that unseasonably warm weather in late 

  December and early January had boosted their business. A contact in Myrtle Beach, 

  S.C., reported that some hotels were booked to capacity and were turning tourists 

  away during the week after Christmas. Reports from mountain areas were generally 

  upbeat as well. Contacts at mountain resorts in Virginia said that declining 

  gasoline prices in December had helped their business and also noted that they 

  were seeing more visitors from outside the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Temporary Employment
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Employment agents in the District generally reported flat demand for temporary 

  workers since our last report. An agent in Raleigh, N.C., said that demand for 

  workers had been slowed by the holidays in December; however, he looked for 

  a pickup in hiring in 2005. An agent in Hagerstown, Md., also expected demand 

  for workers at his agency to strengthen as the economy continued to grow. Workers 

  with administrative and sales skills and those with production or distribution 

  center experience were most highly sought.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Warm weather in early December accelerated the growth of late-planted winter 

  grains and extended the grazing period for livestock in Virginia and West Virginia. 

  Small grain crops were reported to be in mostly good condition in most areas 

  of the District. But the last week of December brought very cold temperatures 

  across the District and a snow storm along the Atlantic Coast, leading to unusually 

  large amounts of supplemental feeding of livestock in Virginia and West Virginia.
