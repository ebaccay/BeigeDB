      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 29, 2012
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from business contacts in the First District are somewhat mixed. Tourism   contacts and some retailers cite strong results, but other merchants are more   downbeat. Manufacturers mostly report solid performance, but a couple have seen   sales fall compared with a year earlier. Software and IT services firms indicate   business is good, but somewhat slower than three months ago, while staffing   firms say recent results are below expectations. Commercial real estate   conditions are not much changed, with the Boston market said to be stronger than   the rest of New England; gradual recovery continues in most residential real   estate markets around the region. Business contacts say they are hiring only   modestly; prices are generally reported to be stable. Outlooks remain uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      First District retail contacts offer a   very mixed take on economic conditions in the region. Demand remains strong for   adult clothing, but spending on durable items such as furniture and electronics   continues to be lower than earlier in the year. Some companies cite   disappointing sales during the last six weeks, while others report some upside   surprises. Sales results range from low single-digit declines to high   single-digit increases compared with a year earlier. Some contacts say that   consumer sentiment has become more negative, while others observe that consumers   are "coming back." Retailers note wholesale prices remain flat so they are   holding selling prices steady. Respondents still express uncertainty about the   direction of the U.S. economy and say they expect little improvement over the   next six to eight months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourism industry continues to see growth. Contacts expect that overall   2012 performance will be strong, but express concern that performance will   weaken over the last few months of the year. While a rebound in business travel   has fueled 2012 performance to date, weakness in Europe might slow this down.   Moreover, rising gas prices could have negative repercussions for leisure   travel.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The general   manufacturing picture in the First District continues to be mixed, although   contacts seem to be slightly more upbeat than earlier this summer. Of 12   contacted firms, only two report lower overall sales than a year earlier: A   manufacturer of semiconductors attributes the decline largely to   industry-specific cycles and a software company that sells mostly into the   defense business says slower sales reflect fears about impending sequestration.   All other responding firms report flat or rising sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the employment front, while most contacts say they are hiring, none   reports any significant additions. A major defense contractor expects   significant layoffs in the coming months but attributes them largely to   rationalization of operations in the wake of a merger. A tool manufacturer   blames weak demand for a 5 percent headcount reduction but says they will   concentrate most of the layoffs in Europe. On the plus side, a luxury goods   manufacturer reports that, for the first time since 2008, workers are quitting   to take better jobs with other firms. A firm in the chemical industry indicates   it is exceptionally profitable but is still hiring only "selectively" to replace   outgoing workers and fill specific needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Few manufacturers report revising their investment plans in recent months;   several note that they have plenty of cash available but don't yet feel   confident or see the need for additional capital spending. Several firms mention   that merger and acquisition activity is heating up. Some say they hope to pick   up bargains but others say that prices are too high. A contact in the chemical   industry says that he has done due diligence on several potential targets and   each time he was outbid. A respondent in the semiconductor industry reports that   they were the target of acquisition interest and a medical device supplier was   recently acquired by Japanese firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts say the pricing picture is much more benign than it has been in   recent years. A dairy business is the only respondent complaining of high input   prices, which are specifically related to the drought in the Midwest. A contact   in the chemical business reports that pricing of inputs to his processes is   exceptionally good, which he attributes to weakness in China, Brazil, and India.
     </p>
     <p>
      Few manufacturing contacts have significantly revised their outlooks. The   main concerns remain the so-called "fiscal cliff" and the situation in Europe.   Europe does not seem to be as much of an issue as it has been in recent cycles,   however, with only four contacts specifically mentioning it and only one   identifying it as a major problem. Two respondents independently note that firms   are paying bills on time, which they say is a good sign about the state of the   economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Software and Information Technology Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England   software and information technology services contacts report flat to favorable   results in the second quarter of 2012, with year-over-year revenue increases   generally between 5 percent and 10 percent. Contacts report strong demand in the   banking and medical sectors as well as some new activity in the automotive,   telecommunications, and manufacturing sectors. However, these upticks in demand   are, for many contacts, tempered by the strong dollar and economic   uncertainties, particularly in Europe, which are having an increasingly negative   effect on revenues. Indeed, one contact reports that revenues from Europe fell   more than 50 percent over the four quarters ended in Q2, as many clients delayed   execution of big license agreements. Most respondents continue to add to their   headcounts, although a few have slowed the rate at which they are hiring.   Capital and technology spending and selling prices have gone largely unchanged   since February.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook among software and IT services contacts is not appreciably   different from that of three months ago. Most are cautiously optimistic and   expect current growth rates to continue into 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Staffing Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      New England staffing firms generally   report lighter-than-expected volumes through mid-August, with most contacts   characterizing business as "slow" or "flat." The May-to-August dip reportedly   reflects a softening of demand for office and clerical assistants and light   industrial workers. Nevertheless, year-over-year revenue changes in the second   quarter remained largely positive, bolstered by steady demand from the   engineering, legal, and IT sectors. The number of permanent and   temporary-to-permanent placements continues to grow slowly, with one contact   noting that clients are "definitely more willing to commit." Labor supply has   gone largely unchanged since May. Contacts continue to have difficulty finding   candidates with high-end skill sets such as mechanical and electrical engineers,   software developers, and IT personnel; two contacts report that this shortage of   qualified labor is putting upward pressure on pay rates and recruiting costs.   Looking forward, staffing contacts are slightly less upbeat than they were 3   months ago. Most expect only modest growth until 2013.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Commercial real estate   fundamentals held roughly steady in recent weeks across the First District.   Boston continues to enjoy strong leasing demand in pockets of the city and   comparatively slow but steady activity in the Financial District. Leasing   activity remains light in Hartford, where the retail sector is seen as a weak   point. Activity in Providence is mixed across sectors and year-to-date has   fallen short of expectations as a result of vacancy shocks. In Portland, office   leasing activity is up from earlier in the year, but rents have stayed roughly   flat. Across the District, a few contacts note that traditional downtown tenant   types, such as law firms and large financial firms, continue to reduce square   footage of office space per worker. These reductions are viewed as structural   and suggest that future employment growth in professional services may lead to   less absorption than previous norms of office space would imply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Investor interest in Greater Boston commercial real estate remains high,   especially for multifamily rental properties, and interest rate spreads are   lower than a year earlier for comparable deals. Apartment construction extended   its recent boom in the city and some large build-to-suit office projects have   broken ground in recent months. One Boston-based bank lender notes an increase   in small-scale (under $10M) loan demand in recent months in the office and   retail sectors. Outside of Boston, construction and investment sales activity   remain limited. A few contacts remark that political uncertainty is putting a   damper on business sentiment. In particular, the threat of tax hikes (at all   levels of government) is seen as a possible restraint on economic activity in   the coming months. By contrast, no contacts cite significant upside risks to   growth in the commercial property sector, although Boston is expected to remain   a magnet for investors.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sales of single-family homes and   condominiums continued to grow year-over-year in June and July throughout most   of the First District. However, in Connecticut, June sales increased marginally   in the single-family home market and declined year-over-year in the condo   market, but the latest reports for July suggest more substantial increases in   Connecticut home sales. Similar to previous reports, contacts cite low interest   rates and prices, in addition to pent-up demand, as significant factors in   improving sales activity. According to a contact in Greater Boston, rising   residential rents continue to spur interest in home ownership. Reports for July   suggest the median sales price of homes rose in five of the six New England   states; the exception was Rhode Island, where prices continue to decline.   Contacts outside of Rhode Island cite declining inventory as the cause for   modest price appreciation. Several contacts in areas with low inventory levels   note some potential sellers are waiting for their homes to appreciate in value   before listing them. Falling inventories in Greater Boston have prompted concern   among local real estate professionals that potential homebuyers will be   discouraged by an insufficient variety of homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consecutive months of year-over-year growth in sales have made contacts feel   more confident about recovery in the housing market. In areas where inventory   levels have been high for the past few years, concerns have been calmed by   declining inventory and increasing home prices. Most contacts predict   year-over-year growth in sales, albeit at a slower pace than recently, and   anticipate modest increases in the median sale price of homes in coming months.
