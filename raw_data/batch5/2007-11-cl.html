      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic growth in the Fourth District, although positive,  has slowed since our last report.  In  general, manufacturing output has been steady while production at auto assembly  plants increased during October.  Activity  in commercial construction was stable with a few contractors expecting a  slowing in their backlogs going into 2008.   Home builders reported new home sales were unchanged to declining.  District retailers experienced relatively  weak sales.  Demand for business and  consumer loans was steady to declining while the number of delinquencies  rose.  Reports on credit quality showed  some deterioration, especially on the consumer side.  Oil production was up whereas natural gas  production fell slightly.  Truck freight  volume was unchanged to declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment levels  across the District were largely unchanged.  On balance,  staffing firms reported a slight decrease in job openings while the number of  job seekers was flat.  Little wage  pressure was reported.  With the  exception of petroleum-based products, supplier prices and material costs were  relatively stable.  Several manufacturers reported raising  their prices during the past six weeks, and some anticipate raising prices in  the upcoming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Most District manufacturers told us that  production has been steady over the past six weeks with reports of increased  production being offset by slowdowns attributed to seasonal factors and  scheduled maintenance.  On a  year-over-year basis, contacts reported output has been unchanged to declining  slightly.  Steel producers characterized  shipping volumes as flat.  The strongest  end markets for steel included energy, nonresidential construction, and  aerospace/defense.  Looking forward,  almost all of our contacts anticipate production and shipping volume to remain  at current levels or decrease slightly.   Auto assembly plants within the District reported higher production  during October.  Foreign nameplates and  their domestic counterparts shared in the increase.  On a year-over-year basis, automakers  experienced a slight production decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers  reported that capacity utilization is at, or slightly below, normal levels with  little to no change over the past six weeks.   Further, capital expenditures were on plan with the expectation that  current spending levels will be maintained in the upcoming months.  With the exception of petroleum-based  products and metals, input prices were stable.   About a third of our contacts said they have raised their prices during  the past six weeks, and some anticipate raising prices in the upcoming months.  A majority of respondents reported no change  in the size of their workforce.  Those  citing employment declines attributed them to organizational restructuring, seasonal  factors, and attrition.  Hiring in the  near future is expected to be very slow.   Wage pressures were minimal.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real  Estate
       <br/>
      </strong>
      New home sales in the  District were unchanged or declined since our last report.  Sales continue to be down  year-over-year.  Looking forward, most  builders believe a turnaround will not occur until 2009.  Home prices were generally stable; however,  several builders reported increasing their discounting, especially for spec  houses.  On balance, material costs  remain stable.  Almost all contractors  told us that the size of their current workforce is in line with market  conditions, and they don't anticipate additional layoffs.  Concerns about labor costs were limited to  increases for health care coverage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most commercial  contractors reported that business has been stable since early October and has  picked-up slightly on a year-over-year basis.   Segments showing strong activity include health care, education, and  infrastructure.  Looking forward, nearly  all contacts said that they expect activity in 2008 to be at, or near, 2007  levels.  When asked to comment on their  backlogs, contractors had mixed responses.   Some rated their backlogs as good to very good while others, although  busy at this time, are expecting some slowing going into 2008.  For the most part, material costs were stable  during the past six weeks--though fuel costs have risen significantly.  Workforce levels remain largely unchanged.  Contractors have not experienced any wage  pressures; however, almost all reported increased health care costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer  Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      District retailers  reported general merchandise sales were flat to declining since our last report  while sales of food, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products  increased.  Contacts told us that the  warm autumn weather affected the sales of seasonal merchandise.  Retailers had mixed opinions regarding the  upcoming holiday shopping season.  Auto  dealers reported a decline in the sales of new and used vehicles during October,  and they anticipate a downward trend in the coming months.  Vendor prices were stable during the past six  weeks.  Hiring was limited to temporary  workers needed for the holiday season, and little wage pressure was reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
       <br/>
      </strong>
      In general, demand for business and  consumer loans was steady to declining during the past six weeks.  The one exception was an increase in  commercial real estate loans by national banks.   Reports on auto loans and home equity lines of credit were mixed while  the residential mortgage market remains sluggish.  Core deposits were flat to slightly up.  Most of our contacts told us that their  margins continue to decline.  Respondents  reported an increase in delinquencies, especially for residential mortgages and  commercial real estate loans, and some decline in credit quality, in  particular, on the consumer side.   Looking forward, bankers anticipate a continuing drop in loan demand,  restrictive credit conditions, and increased margin pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
       <br/>
      </strong>
      In general, natural gas production has  declined slightly while oil production has increased.  At the same time, prices received for crude  rose significantly while gas prices were flat.  Capital  expenditures remain on plan with little change expected during the next few  months.  Most of our contacts said that  material and equipment costs have increased over the past six weeks.  Employment levels are largely unchanged.  Several contacts reported some wage pressure  due to competition among companies to keep their best employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Transportation
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Truck freight volume was steady to  declining over the past six weeks with the shipment of construction supplies  being singled out as particularly weak.   Looking forward to 2008, most contacts were uncertain about the level of  business activity with only a few anticipating modest growth, at best.  Several trucking executives believe there is  overcapacity in the industry, which is keeping shipping prices competitive.  Increasing fuel costs were cited as an issue  by most respondents with some reporting that they were unable to recover the  entire amount through surcharges.  On  net, there has been a slight decrease in employment levels due to layoffs.  Wage pressures are not an issue at this  time.
