      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 12, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from the twelve Federal Reserve Districts indicate that economic activity 
  continued to expand since the last report. Four Districts reported that economic 
  growth firmed while a couple of Districts noted that growth cooled. Other reports 
  generally characterized growth as moderate or mixed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending increased more quickly in a number of Districts, although 
  several reports continued to note that automobile and home-related sales were 
  sluggish. Tourism was generally strong and added some momentum in the New York 
  and Kansas City Districts. Activity in the service sector expanded in most Districts, 
  but Boston described activity as flat and Cleveland and Dallas identified pockets 
  of softness in some industries. Manufacturing conditions generally held up well, 
  with several Districts indicating that growth increased, though Philadelphia 
  reported that activity edged down. Commercial construction gained strength in 
  most of the country. Reports on residential real estate, however, indicated 
  widespread cooling with the majority of Districts citing lower asking prices, 
  rising inventories of homes on the market and softening sales. A number of reports, 
  however, indicated that residential activity increased in some markets. Financial 
  institutions continued to report that residential mortgage lending had tapered 
  off, but commercial lending activity picked up in several Districts. Agricultural 
  conditions generally improved as rainfall brought relief to drought-stricken 
  areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of Districts reported that labor markets were tight with some noting 
  shortages of skilled workers. Wage pressures were associated with tightening 
  conditions in a few Districts, though other reports noted that wage pressures 
  were in check. While the majority of Districts characterized price pressures 
  as contained, input prices increased in several Districts and a few reports 
  mentioned increased pass throughs by businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Most Districts reported stronger growth in consumer spending, although automobile 
  and housing-related sales generally weakened. Solid back-to-school sales helped 
  boost retail revenues in the Philadelphia, Atlanta and Minneapolis Districts. 
  Chicago said back-to-school sales were within expectations, though "nothing 
  stellar." Sales of upscale merchandise picked up in the New York District, 
  while apparel sales grew more quickly in the Boston, Cleveland and San Francisco 
  Districts. Chain department store sales were stronger in the Richmond District 
  and same-store sales increased in the New York District. Softer residential 
  real estate conditions damped home improvement and furniture sales in the New 
  York, Richmond, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vehicle sales weakened in several Districts--particularly sales of domestic 
  automobiles, SUVs and light trucks. However, a few Districts reported increased 
  sales of foreign cars and fuel-efficient automobiles. Philadelphia noted that 
  a growing number of smaller automobile dealerships had closed and dealers in 
  the Atlanta District added incentives to move inventory. In the Dallas District, 
  sales of luxury vehicles increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity strengthened since our last report. New York said that tourism 
  remained robust in New York City. Kansas City reported solid gains in hotel 
  occupancy rates, while tourist activity in the San Francisco District remained 
  at a high level despite some moderation. Tourism in the Richmond District was 
  temporarily dented by Hurricane Ernesto in early September, but rebounded later 
  in the month.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Activity in the service sector generally strengthened across Districts since 
  the last report. The Philadelphia, Richmond, St. Louis and San Francisco Districts 
  reported increased demand for professional and technical services. Boston reported 
  increased demand for consulting and financial services, and along with San Francisco, 
  for healthcare services. Richmond indicated that demand for computer and web-based 
  services firmed and San Francisco noted that demand for media services was stronger. 
  Assessments of transportation services were mixed. Trucking firms reported declining 
  volume in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta and Dallas Districts, and in 
  Cleveland, shipping services continued to soften. Chicago said trucking volume 
  was up slightly and cargo shipping increased in the Dallas District. St. Louis 
  reported that freight transportation companies planned expansions. Atlanta indicated 
  that rail companies experienced steady growth in inter-modal shipment volume, 
  and Dallas said that rail demand was strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity remained generally strong in most Districts. Eight of 
  the twelve Districts indicated that factory output increased, while Chicago 
  and Kansas City noted that the pace of expansion slowed. Minneapolis described 
  factory activity as mixed and Philadelphia reported that factory production 
  edged down. The output of energy-related equipment increased in the Boston, 
  Atlanta and Dallas Districts, while Chicago and San Francisco indicated that 
  orders for machine tools increased. San Francisco reported that semiconductor 
  sales were solid. The demand for steel was especially strong according to Atlanta 
  and Chicago, while Cleveland and Chicago noted that heavy equipment sales continued 
  to be robust. Chicago also reported strength in heavy-duty truck production. 
  In contrast, St. Louis said that producers of motor vehicle parts announced 
  plans to lay off workers and Cleveland reported weakness in the auto industry. 
  Reports of softer demand for housing-related products continued to be widespread, 
  but Dallas noted that strong demand from the commercial construction industry 
  helped offset softer residential demand. Cleveland, Minneapolis, Dallas and 
  San Francisco said that sales of food products had accelerated since our last 
  report.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Nearly all Districts reported that housing market conditions continued to soften, 
  though several noted that activity increased in some markets. Most Districts 
  reported higher home inventories, and several said that homebuilders and sellers 
  continued to offer incentives to attract buyers. Softer home demand in San Francisco 
  led to layoffs for mortgage brokers and real estate agents. Residential construction 
  remained weak in the St. Louis and Minneapolis Districts except in western North 
  Dakota where residential construction was described as "robust." New home inventories 
  inched up in the Dallas District despite strong demand in some of its markets 
  and inventories of single family homes and condominiums rose sharply in the 
  Boston District.
     </p>
     <p>
      New York and St. Louis reported mixed housing activity. On the upside, Manhattan 
  condominium sales showed signs of resilience, and housing sales rose in Memphis, 
  but both Districts noted weakness in most markets. Richmond reported generally 
  weaker housing activity, but also noted increases in some markets. Atlanta said 
  that housing activity rose in its Mississippi Gulf market, and Minneapolis' 
  Sioux Falls market remained on pace with last year's record-breaking level. 
  Dallas reported particularly robust home sales in its Houston, Austin and El 
  Paso markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets were strong in most Districts, and activity 
  increased at a faster pace in a number. Leasing activity increased in New York, 
  Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas and San Francisco, and held steady in Richmond. 
  Chicago and St. Louis, however, said leasing activity was mixed. Rent increases 
  were reported by New York, Minneapolis and San Francisco, with Dallas indicating 
  that pricing power was shifting to landlords.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction was generally strong. Construction activity was 
  steady in the Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts 
  and increased in the Chicago and Dallas Districts. Material costs and budget 
  concerns scaled back some projects in the Atlanta and Chicago Districts. The 
  Chicago and Minneapolis reports noted concerns among some contacts that commercial 
  construction may slow in the coming months.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Lending activity was mixed as increases in commercial lending were offset by 
  further weakness in residential mortgage lending. The New York, Richmond and 
  Chicago Districts reported declines in overall loan demand, while Philadelphia, 
  St. Louis and Kansas City reported modest increases. Demand for residential 
  mortgages slowed in the New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, 
  Chicago, Dallas and San Francisco Districts. Demand for commercial and industrial 
  loans rose in the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis 
  and San Francisco Districts; held steady in the Richmond and Dallas Districts; 
  and declined in the New York District. The commercial lending market was characterized 
  as very competitive by Richmond, Chicago and Dallas. Overall credit quality 
  remained generally good, although increases in mortgage delinquency rates were 
  noted by Philadelphia, Cleveland and Atlanta. Tighter standards for commercial 
  loans were reported by New York and Chicago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture and Natural Resources
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agriculture conditions generally improved as late summer rainfall brought relief 
  to drought-stricken Districts, although some rains hindered field work in some 
  areas and damaged crops in others. Richmond indicated that tropical storm Ernesto 
  severely damaged crops along some coastal areas. Chicago and St. Louis reported 
  that recent precipitation and unseasonably cool weather delayed corn and soybean 
  harvests. Crop yields in the Minneapolis District improved with the rainfall, 
  though Chicago reported that yield prospects were mixed. In the Kansas City 
  District, cooler weather and scattered rainfall restored soil moisture and pastures 
  conditions, though cattle producers continued to draw down herds. Dallas, however, 
  said that while September rains assisted wheat producers and eased pressure 
  on livestock producers to liquidate herds, many parts of the District still 
  needed rain. San Francisco reported strong sales for livestock and most crops 
  but indicated that spinach producers put planting on hold.
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the energy industry remained strong according to reports from the 
  Minneapolis, Kansas City and San Francisco Districts. Minneapolis indicated 
  that alternative energy industries continued to expand at a rapid pace and that 
  mining production was at near-capacity across the District. Kansas City noted 
  that oil and gas drilling rig counts remained above year-ago levels, while San 
  Francisco said that oil and natural gas extraction continued at a rapid pace. 
  In contrast, Dallas reported that activity in the oil and energy producing sector 
  was virtually unchanged although demand for oil-field equipment and energy services 
  remained strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment, Wages, Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor market conditions remained taut since our last report. The Boston, Philadelphia, 
  Richmond, Minneapolis and Dallas reports characterized labor markets as generally 
  tight, particularly for skilled workers, while the remaining Districts noted 
  that job growth was steady to stronger. Six Districts mentioned labor shortages, 
  particularly for professional, scientific, and other technical workers. In addition, 
  Kansas City said retailers faced shortages of experienced sales workers and 
  Atlanta indicated that residential construction firms were having difficulty 
  obtaining qualified construction workers, despite the slowdown in building activity. 
  In contrast, Cleveland reported that roughly half of the homebuilders they contacted 
  had reduced their labor force.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wage growth around the nation was generally modest, although faster wage growth 
  for skilled services workers was cited by a number of Districts. The San Francisco 
  District noted that a short supply of healthcare, finance and construction workers 
  pushed wages higher. In addition, Richmond noted a sharp uptick in retail wages 
  and Atlanta reported that some manufacturers had raised entry-level wages in 
  an effort to attract workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most Districts reported few signs of increased price pressures in recent weeks. 
  A number of Districts said that energy prices moderated, but increases in raw 
  materials prices were noted by Philadelphia, Richmond and Atlanta, and a rise 
  in building materials prices was reported by Minneapolis. Instances of businesses 
  passing on higher costs were scattered across Districts; Cleveland and Atlanta 
  said some manufacturers attempted to raise output prices while Boston reported 
  increases in retail prices. Boston also reported that costs for some businesses 
  had increased--especially for airfare and hotel accommodations. Likewise, the 
  New York District noted that accommodation and theatre ticket prices had risen 
  sharply compared to a year ago.
