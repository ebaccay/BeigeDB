      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 5, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Seventh    District continued to expand at a modest pace in July and August. Only a few    contacts reported impacts on real economic activity from recent financial    market developments, though a number said the developments had led them to    lower their expectations for the rest of the year. Consumer spending and    business outlays continued to rise. Labor market conditions were mixed by    industry and location. Residential construction declined further in most    areas, while the pace of nonresidential development was generally steady.    Manufacturing expanded at a slower pace. Household lending declined, while    business lending was flat. Overall wage and cost pressures were similar to    those in the previous reporting period. The District was poised for a record    corn crop, although first dry weather and then storms hurt corn and soybean    conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending continued to    increase at a gradual rate. One retailer noted a sluggish start to the    back-to-school shopping season compared to last year but thought the slowness    reflected a later start to the school year in many districts. Furniture sales    were up slightly from a year ago. A discount shoe retailer noted sales    declines owing to a falloff in store traffic. Inventories were generally in    line with desired levels. Vehicle sales in central Indiana were slower than    usual in early August and generally little changed from July. One dealer said    that vehicle shoppers were not talking about the recent financial market    volatility in their decisionmaking, but the dealer thought it would be some    time before the full impact is felt. Tourism activity in Michigan picked up    slightly in August compared with earlier in the summer, however most contacts    were pessimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Business Spending
       <br/>
      </strong>
      Business spending rose again in the    District. Capital expenditures continued to increase in line with previous    plans for modest gains. A large biofuel plant came on line in northern    Indiana, and an analyst noted that the wallboard industry continued to add    capacity on net. In contrast, a health care provider cancelled plans for a    strategic expansion. Freight hauling was little changed from the previous    period. Commercial electricity sales were strong, though one utility marked    down its expectations for the rest of the year. Changes in labor market    conditions were mixed by industry and location. An analyst in Illinois    reported modest job growth overall, with gains at professional business    service firms and manufactured goods exporters offsetting losses at retailers    and construction firms. Employment declined in Iowa on balance. An    engineering firm planned to add staff in southeast Michigan, while a software    developer was hiring in Indiana. In contrast, mortgage brokers announced    layoffs in several locations. A staffing firm reported that bookings in the    past six weeks were below expectations, in part because some large customers    were holding back hiring in response to heightened uncertainties surrounding    the recent developments in financial markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Both residential construction and home    sales continued to fall in most areas of the District. A Chicagoland    homebuilder reported that it has seen its steepest decline in construction    since the early 1990s. One homebuilder in Michigan projected its activity to    be slow for the next two to four years. Builders' cancellations began to    taper off from high levels. Price discounts and incentives continued to grow    for potential homebuyers. The pace of nonresidential development was    generally steady. One contact from Michigan reported concern about the    potential for overbuilding of medical offices. Office and industrial    vacancies were steady or improving in many District cities, and office rents    moved higher. Contacts generally noted that the recent volatility in the    financial markets currently has had little effect on the demand for    nonresidential space but has restricted developers' ability to obtain    financing for projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing expanded at a slower    pace than earlier in the year. Manufacturers in a number of industries,    including machinery and machine tools, reported strong demand from abroad;    steel producers began exporting regularly for the first time. Domestic demand    for agriculture machinery continued to run higher than was expected at the    beginning of the year, and shipments of mining and oil and gas extraction    equipment remained strong. In contrast, sales to domestic customers of other    heavy equipment, particularly construction machinery, continued to trend    lower, and one contact in the industry was not expecting much of a    turnaround. Domestic machine tool sales slowed in August, though contacts    were waiting to see how September turned out before getting concerned that    this trend would persist. New heavy truck orders in the US were weaker than    expected, with one analyst pointing to a larger-than-expected impact from the    slowdown in housing as a key factor. An automaker said that nationwide sales    were running below expectations in August, and vehicle makers planned cuts in    production for the fourth quarter. A steel producer said domestic business    conditions seemed soft, though the seasonal lack of business at this time of    year made it difficult to judge the true strength of demand. Steel    inventories continued to move lower and were at desired levels. Shipments of    gypsum wallboard continued to fall, and one contact expected declines to    continue into 2008.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Household lending declined modestly. Applications for home    mortgages continued to trend lower, and lenders were tightening standards and    approving fewer applications. Consumer credit quality deteriorated modestly;    delinquency rates for both first and second mortgages increased. Foreclosures    increased in every state in the District except Illinois. A banker in Indiana    noted that title companies were requiring mortgage brokers to settle via wire    transfer rather than by check. Several contacts in the auto industry said    that it was becoming more difficult to underwrite auto loans for borrowers    with less-than-perfect credit. Business lending was little changed in most    areas. Business credit quality remained favorable. Standards and terms of    commercial loans tightened somewhat, and lenders have been adding back    protective covenants. Spreads on bank loans widened, and one bank said it    sent a message to    its loan officers that they should be able to get broader spreads in the    current market environment. Small- and medium-sized banks reported little    impact from recent financial market developments, though one large bank in    the District changed its lending practices after having problems securitizing    some of its loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices and Costs
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Overall wage and cost pressures were    similar to those in the previous reporting period. Almost every contact noted    the high level of energy prices; diesel prices moved up, boosting operating    costs for farmers. Commercial construction contacts reported increases in    structural material costs. A toolmaker reported plans to increase its catalog    prices early next year, adding that it was confident those prices would be in    place for some time because material price volatility had fallen. A specialty    steel producer indicated that nickel prices were down significantly since the    start of the year, but it would not have an impact on their final prices for    a while because of the lead times in their business. Retailers in Michigan    suggested that price increases were more modest, though food and beverage    prices continued to rise noticeably. A staffing firm reported that its pay    rates rose at a steady pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Crop conditions fared poorly with dry    weather earlier in the reporting period and too much precipitation later.    Recent storms damaged fields across the District, trimming yields. Only corn    in Illinois and Iowa and soybeans in Iowa were in better shape than a year    ago. Nonetheless, the District was poised for a record corn harvest, because    farmers had planted more corn at the expense of soybeans. Grain storage    construction increased, but not enough to alleviate concerns about storage    and transportation issues at harvest. Corn prices declined in July but    recovered in August. Soybean prices were lower at the end of the reporting    period. Milk prices increased, while hog and cattle prices were little    changed on balance. Ethanol and hog operations continued to expand. There    were reports of higher prices for farmland at Iowa auctions.
