      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Business contacts in the First District continue to report mixed results.   Some manufacturers cite slowing demand while others continue to enjoy strong   sales, retail activity is mostly flat, tourism is up, staffing and software and   IT services firms note continued growth, and real estate markets remain   sluggish. Respondents say input cost pressures have eased somewhat since the   last report. Firms are doing little hiring. Contacts in all sectors note that   the outlook is increasingly uncertain.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Year to date through early August,   contacted First District retailers report generally flat sales compared to a   year earlier. Reports range from down 5 percent to up almost 4 percent.   Consumers are conservative in the purchases they are making and, in particular,   are avoiding big-ticket items. Sales of furniture and office supplies have been   sluggish, while apparel and home improvement categories have performed a bit   better. One contact saw a pronounced downward sales trend in recent weeks that   he attributes to consumer concerns about the debt ceiling debate, stock market   gyrations, ongoing high unemployment, and continuing unease about the U.S.   economy's medium-term prospects. Some contacts are hiring, but most are cautious   about adding to head count and one may have layoffs after the holidays.   Retailers say that commodity price increases have moderated. Inventory levels   are being positioned for an uncertain economic environment. All respondents   voice concern that the economic outlook is sluggish for the foreseeable future;   they are scaling back capital spending plans for 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       Travel and tourism in the region continued a strong upward trend through the   second quarter that began a year earlier; as of June 2011 year-to-date activity   in the hotel and visitor sector was up 7 percent from 2010. However, since   mid-July, activity has softened and slowed, leading to an increase in   promotional offers to shore up hotel bookings. The tourism industry has scaled   back its 2011 forecast and now thinks that a 5 percent increase would represent   a great year. The revised forecast reflects both lower consumer confidence and   potential reductions in business travel based on an uncertain economic outlook   for the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Related Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing contacts   report relatively mixed business conditions, especially compared to the   widespread favorable reports earlier this year. Some firms cite flatter and/or   slower revenue growth in the current quarter compared to the first half of the   year, while others say sales growth continues to be relatively robust.   Semiconductor-related manufacturers in particular note declines in demand,   although they attribute it to standard demand cycles for their products, given   the surge in purchasing they saw in late 2010 and early 2011. A diversified   manufacturer and a company in the aerospace industry also report somewhat   softening demand, which they attribute to a possible end to the post-recession   sales bounce-back as well as increased economic uncertainty making some   customers less willing to stockpile inventory. A number of firms also note a   slowdown in European demand for their products. By contrast, sales growth at   pharmaceutical companies remains steady, and demand at various industrial supply   manufacturers continues to be strong. Contacts at these industrial products   firms note that they have little lead time between orders and sales and thus   they would know very quickly if demand were slowing. Despite continued favorable   conditions at some companies, nearly all manufacturing contacts voice concern   regarding the current state of economic uncertainty and more than one commented   that the country is "talking itself into a recession."Some respondents continue   to postpone hiring and/or investment to keep costs low while others report   having contingency plans in place should demand turn down noticeably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment remains steady at the vast majority of contacted manufacturers.   One exception is an industrial products manufacturer with headcount up 9 percent   year-to-date who plans to continue to hire as long as demand for their products   remains strong. By contrast, a semiconductor firm has eliminated some of its   temporary workforce because demand for its products is off. A small number of   manufacturers report continued difficulty finding workers for highly skilled   positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fewer manufacturers report input price pressures and/or supply shortages than   in recent rounds, although the costs of rare earth metals continue to pose input   price pressure for some firms. One firm notes that anticipated supply   disruptions from the earthquake in Japan never materialized. Most manufacturers   reporting higher raw material costs continue to be able to pass the price   increases on to their customers with little resistance. A semiconductor firm,   however, notes that economic conditions limit its ability to pass along cost   increases. Healthcare costs continue to be a concern for contacted   manufacturers, although nearly all report providing merit pay increases to their   employees this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responding manufacturers say capital spending remains more or less on plan,   with the majority of capital spending increases relative to last year going to   construction and/or updating of facilities. Most contacted firms report having   excellent cash positions and being willing to invest should a good opportunity   arise. Uncertainty surrounding the economic climate, however, continues to limit   their willingness to invest and hire; they are waiting to see what happens with   the economy before noticeably changing their current operating strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Software and Information Technology Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       New England   software and information technology contacts report that the upward trends of   2010 and early 2011 continued through the end of the second quarter.   Year-over-year revenue increases, ranging from 4 percent to 30 percent, were   driven by notable increases in both software license sales and recurring service   revenues. Reports on activity since July are mixed, however, with some contacts   experiencing downticks and others posting larger-than-expected increases.   Headcounts continue to rise in line with revenue growth, although many contacts   report increasing difficulty in finding qualified software engineers,   programmers, and sales personnel. As a result, some have bolstered their   recruitment efforts and one contact has added jobs overseas. Wages are steady or   up slightly, with annual merit increases generally in the 3 percent to 5 percent   range. Selling prices have been left unchanged as a result of a competitive   market environment. The outlook among New England software and IT services   respondents is not appreciably different from that of 3 months ago, with most   expecting growth in late 2011 and early 2012 to be in the 10 percent to 20   percent range.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Staffing Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Nearly all New England staffing   contacts report upticks in business volume through the end of second quarter and   into the third; however, many respondents lament that overall activity remains   below expectations. Revenues are flat to increasing year-over-year, with   increases in the range of 5 percent to 25 percent. Labor demand continues to   strengthen, albeit modestly, with notable improvements in the manufacturing and   information technology sectors. Demand for permanent and temporary-to-permanent   hiring continues to grow; indeed, two contacts report that permanent placements   are up more than 20 percent relative to last year. Notwithstanding stronger   demand, jobs remain difficult to fill as clients remain fastidious in their   candidate expectations. One contact notes that jobs that used to take just a few   days to fill continue to take weeks. Supply of high-end labor remains tight in   the region, but there has been no significant change since May. Bill rates and   pay rates are steady. Looking forward, New England staffing contacts are   generally less upbeat than they were three and six months ago, with many   expecting to "move sideways" into 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Commercial Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Commercial leasing fundamentals   are roughly unchanged since the last report. Office leasing activity was stable   in Boston but resulted in no significant absorption or changes in rental rates.   In Hartford, the modest momentum observed in the first half stalled as sentiment   turned negative, and the risk of a significant slowdown in leasing and sales   activity in the fourth quarter is considered high. Investor demand for prime   office and apartment buildings in Greater Boston remains strong, raising concern   among some contacts that sales prices are moving too high relative to rents and   occupancy. The lending environment for commercial real estate in Boston is   characterized by aggressive competition among banks, resulting in downward   pressure on mortgage rates. Looking forward, relatively weak office-leasing   demand in Boston is expected to persist in light of recently-announced layoffs   at a few large downtown employers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Residential Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       States throughout New England   experienced increases in home sales in July compared to last year; however,   contacts express little enthusiasm about these increases because they largely   reflect struggling sales activity following the expiration of the homebuyers'   tax credit last year rather than any improvement in activity this year.   Respondents report that activity in the housing market remains sluggish, with   potential buyers remaining apprehensive about economic conditions. The median   sale price of single-family homes and condos remained close to even with a year   ago throughout much of the region. Contacts report sellers pricing competitively   in order to attract bids and buyers negotiating even lower prices. Meanwhile,   listings continue to climb in the region, but most contacts did not express   serious concern about the level of inventory reached.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outlooks for the remainder of the year appear largely pessimistic, with   contacts expecting a continuation of slow activity. Most anticipate sales for   this year will not reach last year's total and forecast little improvement over   the next one to two years.
