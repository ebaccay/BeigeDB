      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <strong>
      November 30, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       The Eleventh District economy grew at a modest pace since the last report.   Manufacturing activity held steady or declined, while demand for business   services was flat. Activity in the transportation services sector was mixed.   Retailers said sales growth moderated. The single-family housing sector saw   continued improvement, and activity in the multifamily sector was strong.   Office, retail and industrial leasing activity increased, but commercial real   estate investment activity remained sluggish. Financial services respondents   said overall loan demand was soft during the reporting period. The energy   industry continued to expand at a robust pace, while agricultural conditions   remained weak. Employment levels were stable at most responding firms and price   pressures were mostly subdued.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price pressures were minimal across industries.   Most contacts said prices were stable or down, although prices for new cars rose   slightly and staffing and legal services firms noted modest increases in billing   rates. The majority of respondents reported that raw materials prices were   unchanged or down. The exceptions were producers of paper and of food who noted   increased prices for some inputs. Contacts in the agricultural sector said   cattle prices rose since the last report.
      </p>
      <p>
       The price of WTI was near $76 per barrel in early October, and has risen to   nearly $100 per barrel. Demand for gasoline has been soft. Diesel demand, in   contrast, has strengthened on a year-over-year basis and prices have climbed   much faster than gasoline. Prices of petrochemicals and plastics declined due to   weak domestic demand and a stronger dollar. Natural gas prices remained low,   near $3.50 per thousand cubic feet throughout the survey period.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Labor Market
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most firms reported steady employment   levels, although there were reports of slight hiring activity. Staffing firms   continued to note high levels of demand. Some oil services firms, primary metals   and transportation manufacturers reported moderate employment increases, and   said they continue to look for additional workers. Retailers said holiday hiring   was ramping up, and one firm noted that they planned on hiring more seasonal   workers than last year. Contacts in the auto sales and airline industries noted   slight payroll increases. Wage pressures remained minimal, although upward   pressure for certain skilled positions was noted by airlines and a few   construction-related manufacturers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most construction-related manufacturers   reported stable demand, although there were reports of stronger sales related to   commercial, government and apartment construction projects. Construction-related   outlooks were mostly unchanged, but a few contacts said they expect conditions   to improve next year.
      </p>
      Respondents in high-tech manufacturing report that   sales have been flat since the last report, with the exception of demand for   mobile devices, cloud computing and data storage which continues to increase.   Several contacts expect strength in demand for mobile and productivity enhancing   devices to accelerate, and thus improve overall activity in the high-tech   manufacturing sector by mid 2012, even if global output remains sluggish or   weakens. Most respondents said employment levels have held steady and   inventories are at desired levels.
      <p>
       Overall conditions in the paper products sector were mixed, but all contacts   described outlooks as weak. Automobile and aviation equipment manufacturers said   sales had softened since the last report but remained significantly up from   year-ago levels. Outlooks are optimistic, with contacts expecting sales to   remain strong through next year. Food producers reported a seasonal increase in   demand, and outlooks were positive, although they are not hiring due to concerns   about current economic conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts described demand as seasonally weak for petrochemicals and plastics.   Sales in domestic markets continued to be sluggish. The recent rise in oil   prices together with lower petrochemical prices is making Texas' natural gas   based products more competitive, spurring exports. Refiner margins were strong   and over $25 per barrel in October, but have narrowed in recent weeks with the   rise in crude prices. Refinery utilization rates were low, as production   declined for the fall maintenance period.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Sales
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales growth moderated since the last   report but showed continued gains over the comparable period a year ago. Cooler   weather spurred winter clothing sales, and one retailer reported strong online   sales. Contacts indicated that they are comfortable with level of inventories.   Eleventh District retail sales growth trended roughly in-line with the nation   over the reporting period, according to two large retailers. Overall,   expectations are for modest growth this holiday season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for automobiles held steady. Vehicle inventories have mostly   normalized from the tsunami-related shortage experienced earlier in the year,   but some foreign manufactures have been recently affected by the flooding in   Thailand. The used car market continued to be tight. Contacts expect sales to   slow seasonally through year end, and then to rise moderately in 2012.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for staffing services held steady at high   levels. One contact reported engineering, IT and healthcare as strong sectors,   and another mentioned solid demand for steel workers. Outlooks remain cautious   but were more optimistic than the previous reporting period, with contacts   expecting demand to remain flat or improve by mid-2012. Demand for accounting   services was flat, and outlooks were unchanged. Legal firms reported steady   demand, with a slight pickup in litigation activity and continued strength in   intellectual property, energy and some real-estate related services.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from transportation service firms were mixed. Railroad firms reported   a broad-based increase in shipments during the reporting period, but said that   the numbers were somewhat artificially inflated due to capacity coming back   online after the flooding in the northern U.S. Overall container volumes   declined during the reporting period, and outlooks were slightly less optimistic   than the last report. Small parcel shipments rose in October partly due to   growth in retail trade activity. Airlines reported solid and steady demand over   the past six weeks. A major airline noted that business travelers were more   price sensitive than earlier in the year. Domestic demand and travel to Latin   America remained strong, but travel to Europe and Asia was weak. Airline   contacts expect to see stable demand through year end.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Construction and Real Estate
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts in the housing   sector continued to note improvement. Inventories of existing homes fell further   since the last report, and new home inventories remained lean. Single-family   home sales are better according to contacts, but economic uncertainty is keeping   many would-be buyers on the sidelines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apartment demand rose even more since the last report, and contacts are very   positive in their outlooks. Some respondents noted increased sales of apartment   complexes to investors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contacts that lease to industrial, retail and   business firms noted an increase in demand. However, sales of commercial   properties were sluggish given the current financial environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Financial firms reported steady but   soft demand for loans. National banks noted strong demand from large   corporations but flat or declining middle-market lending activity. Regional   banks said loan demand was flat, and loan pricing remained somewhat aggressive.   The quality of loans outstanding continued to improve, with contacts noting a   decline in problem loans. Outlooks are cautious, although contacts were less   pessimistic than they have been over the past few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Energy
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Drilling activity remains strong, with 20 new land   rigs added in Texas since the last report. Shale-directed activity continues at   high levels. Revenues are growing and backlogs remain solid. Activity in the   Gulf of Mexico also rose by six rigs, with new permits issued for deep water   drilling.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The District remained in drought, although   severity lessened slightly in parts of Texas and New Mexico that received some   rain in recent weeks. Planting of winter wheat continued at a fairly normal pace   but the crop was in poorer condition than last year due to very low soil   moisture. Livestock sell-offs continued at a slower pace, as many producers have   already liquidated much of their herds. Grain prices fell slightly over the   reporting period, largely due to lower export demand. By contrast, cattle prices   were higher than six weeks ago and beef exports remained very strong.
