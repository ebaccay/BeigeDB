      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 28, 2007
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      First District businesses  contacted in mid-November mostly report continuing revenue gains, but rising  caution. Staffing firms cite steady growth and particular strength in the Boston area, while software and  information technology services firms report a slowdown in revenue growth.  Residential real estate markets remain weak and commercial markets continue to  soften. Manufacturers are raising selling prices to pass along cost increases;  they are more upbeat than retailers about 2008.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Retail and  Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Although First District  retailers contacted this time mostly report modest year-over-year increases  with some volatility in September and October, the overall sentiment is generally  cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory levels are mixed. Headcounts  are also mixed, with some respondents reporting increased headcount in line  with company growth or seasonal hiring, while another reports a modest layoff. One  retailer reports intentionally hiring significantly fewer seasonal employees  than usual, while another notes that finding seasonal employees has been  difficult because more people have fulltime jobs. Several contacts cite price  pressures, especially for dairy products. Some respondents say they are starting  to feel the effect of rising oil and gasoline prices, including increased  surcharges and sharply higher prices for plastics. Selling prices remain mostly  stable.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tourism contact reports  that 2007 has been a banner year in the Boston metropolitan area for leisure,  business, and convention travel.   International travel has been particularly strong because of the weak  dollar, and is expected to continue to be robust.  However, there is a growing sense of  uncertainty about how the increasing price of home heating oil and gasoline  will affect domestic leisure travel and tourism in 2008.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, First District  retail respondents are cautious in their outlook for early 2008, although some  are still cautiously optimistic. Most respondents are worried about the impact  of rising energy costs and the recent volatility in financial markets on both  consumer confidence and disposable income.   Several retailers express more concern about early 2008 than about the  upcoming holiday period.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing  and Related Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturers and related  services providers headquartered in the First District report mixed revenue  trends since midyear. Sales of many types of capital goods continue to show  strong gains from year-earlier levels, boosted in part by robust demand from Asia and Europe, as well as by surging  spending on energy, power, and non-automotive transportation equipment.  However, some capital goods manufacturers are experiencing a slowdown in sales  to semiconductor fabricators, financial services firms, and retailers. For the  most part, sales of housing-related and construction products and automotive  components remain sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturers report  that materials costs are rising, especially for metals and oil derivatives, as  well as for items priced in currencies that have appreciated against the  dollar. Only a few respondents have experienced rising energy prices in recent  months; a couple of firms indicate they are shifting to natural gas or wind  power to reduce their dependence on oil. Over three-quarters of the  manufacturing contacts have responded to higher input costs by raising their  selling prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers continue to  adjust their U.S. headcounts only minimally,  but they report somewhat more new restructuring efforts or caution in hiring  than earlier in 2007. Average wage and salary increases remain in the range of  3 percent to 4 percent.  Domestic capital  spending plans are mixed, but generally moderate; U.S. spending will largely  reflect whether and where firms need to add production and product development  capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers and related services providers  are mostly cautiously optimistic about their business prospects over the coming  year. Even those that have a positive sales forecast for 2008 cite downside  risks from factors such as weak consumer confidence, depressed housing markets,  higher oil and commodity prices, and constrained credit availability.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Software and  Information Technology Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      The  majority of software and IT services contacts in the First District report  modest revenue growth for the most recent quarter. While demand from the health  care industry continues to be robust, demand from the financial services sector  is mixed; one contact reports no impact from the credit crunch, another notes  that small to mid-sized financial services firms have curtailed spending,  although "the bigger players" are continuing to buy. The majority of  respondents are adding headcount in revenue-generating positions such as sales  and consulting, although at a slower pace than last quarter. Firms continue to say  the labor market is tight for software engineers. All contacted firms have  raised pay, generally between 3 percent and 5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      New   England software and information technology firms generally project  that revenues will continue growing at current rates. However, several note  that the downside risks have increased.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Staffing  Services
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Staffing  respondents in New England report steady growth  throughout the third quarter. Companies with Boston  locations continue to experience marked increases in revenues from the area,  often citing it as their strongest location. Contacts say demand for staffing  services is greatest in high-end sectors including biopharmaceutical,  engineering, accounting, and legal. Demand from financial services firms remains  soft and one contact reports that demand from the IT sector has fallen in the  last two months. Supply of skilled labor, which was tight in the second  quarter, has become even more limited. Bill rates and pay rates are steady or  up slightly, with most contacts suggesting that the rise reflects both an  increasing proportion of high-end placements and limited supply. Respondents  report stabilizing costs; however, there is upward pressure in healthcare costs  and a few contacts express concern over rising gasoline prices. Contacts expect current trends to  continue through the end of 2007; however, they are more cautious about 2008. Those  with clients in the financial services sector express concern that firms will  hold back on hiring into next year, while contacts with ties to the IT sector  expect further slowing. All are confident that biopharmaceuticals will continue  to be "red-hot" into next year.
      <strong>
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Commercial  Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Tighter credit conditions  remain in place in New England's commercial real estate markets. Investors have not  returned to the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market in  significant numbers, and trust in the ratings agencies is reportedly very low.  Since these other credit sources have dried up, banks and life insurance companies  are picking up a considerable amount of commercial mortgage business. However,  their willingness to add commercial mortgages to their balance sheets is said  to be limited by portfolio allocation considerations. Credit tightening  continues to have the biggest impact on loans for speculative construction. Sales  activity and planned construction have continued to decline in both Boston and Hartford since the last report;  sales transactions have held steady in Maine and Rhode Island, but new construction is  expected to decline in those states as well. For Portland, office-building prices are  said to be down 5 percent to 10 percent from their asking levels since  mid-summer, but retail-space prices are holding steady. In other markets,  average prices are not falling, but word is that properties are being withheld  from the market to avoid potential losses. One bright spot is that foreign  investor demand for prime Boston properties remains strong,  reinforced by the weakening dollar.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the office leasing  market are mixed, but overall the mood has turned more pessimistic. Rental rate  increases appear to be slowing in Boston, where absorption and lease  renewals have slowed. Despite increases in "face rents," lessors have begun  offering building improvements and other concessions in order to retain or  attract tenants. Such deals, together with rising energy and construction  costs, are squeezing owners' profit margins. Office rents and vacancy rates  have been flat in Hartford and Providence, but rents have reportedly  fallen 10 percent in Portland year over year, where  absorption is zero or negative. In Rhode Island, the industrial market  remains strong, with declining vacancy and rising rents, but the retail sector  has been mostly "quiet."
     </p>
     <p>
      Lender reluctance to finance  speculative development is expected to continue over the next 6 to 12 months. Construction  projects in progress or in the planning stages are likely to be delayed or  downsized (especially if they include condominiums), and "build-to-suit" structures  are expected to be the only new construction. European demand for office  investment is expected to remain active. Contacts now seem less likely than  earlier to believe that liquidity will return to the CMBS/conduit market in  force by Q1 2008, although activity is expected to pick up eventually. Some  contacts (in Boston, Providence, and W. Hartford) expect  commercial vacancy rates to continue falling, while others expect absorption to  slow and rent growth to stall or become negative. Still, most contacts do not  predict a glut of commercial space, because supply growth has been restrained over  the past few years.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Residential  Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports on New England residential real estate  markets are mostly negative. In Massachusetts, available data show double-digit  declines (in the mid to high teens) in sales of single family homes and condos  in September compared with a year earlier. Data from the state realtors' group  show steady median home prices in September and a slight increase in condo  prices over the year, while more comprehensive data (including foreclosure  sales and other non-realtor sales as well as sales through realtors) show 3  percent to 4 percent year-over-year declines in median prices of homes and  condos.  Contacts hint that October data  will look no better.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential markets in the  rest of New England similarly show large sales declines and modest price  declines in September. Comprehensive September data from Connecticut (including foreclosure sales,  etc.) show a 3 percent decline year-over-year in median home prices, along with  a 22 percent drop in home sales, after relatively small changes in July and  August. Similar data from Rhode Island show home sales dropping 27  percent year-over-year in September and prices decreasing 7 percent, but Rhode Island realtors' data show more  modest declines, with home sales down 9 percent and prices down 2 percent.  Realtors' data for New Hampshire and Maine show year-over-year home  sales declines of 16 to 18 percent and median price declines under 3 percent.
