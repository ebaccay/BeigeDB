      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 2006
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Tenth District economy grew moderately in late April and May. Manufacturing 
    activity expanded strongly, consumer spending increased, and labor markets continued 
    to firm. Commercial real estate activity edged up, and energy activity rose 
    further. On the negative side, residential construction declined modestly, and 
    drought conditions continued to be a problem in the agricultural sector. Wage 
    pressures increased somewhat, while wholesale and retail price pressures were 
    little changed.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Consumer spending expanded moderately in late April and May. Most retail contacts 
  reported that sales were higher than in the prior survey period and above year-ago 
  levels. However, some store managers indicated that inventory levels were too 
  high, and they expect to trim inventories going forward. As in the previous 
  survey, retail contacts were generally optimistic about sales in the next several 
  months. Auto dealers reported that sales in late April and May were mostly unchanged 
  from the previous survey period and remained lower than a year ago. Sales of 
  large SUVs and pickup trucks were characterized as weak by many dealers. Inventory 
  levels were said to be satisfactory at most dealerships, and contacts generally 
  expect sales to increase somewhat in the coming months. Travel and tourism contacts 
  reported activity was mostly unchanged since the previous survey. Passenger 
  counts at District airports were generally flat but remained appreciably higher 
  than a year ago. Most hotel contacts said that occupancy rates were similar 
  to those seen this time last year. For the most part, travel and tourism contacts 
  expect solid activity during the summer season.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing activity in the District expanded strongly in late April and May. 
  Production, shipments and new orders increased across the District, and many 
  contacts also reported solid growth in capital spending. Growth in manufacturing 
  activity is expected to remain strong in coming months, but growth in capital 
  spending is expected to slow somewhat. Several contacts noted continued difficulty 
  acquiring steel, but no other materials were reported to be abnormally difficult 
  to obtain.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential construction declined slightly in late April and May, while commercial 
  real estate activity edged up. Home builders reported that starts decreased 
  somewhat since the previous survey, and contacts in most parts of the District 
  expect further declines in the months ahead. Construction materials were generally 
  reported to be available, and no significant problems obtaining materials are 
  anticipated in the coming months. Residential real estate agents in most areas 
  said that home sales decreased slightly since the previous survey, with the 
  high-end market showing the most weakness. Inventories of unsold homes continued 
  to rise in many markets and for the most part were well above year-ago levels. 
  Most contacts expect home sales to hold steady or fall further in the coming 
  months. Home price appreciation remained modest in most areas, and real estate 
  agents expect little growth in home prices going forward. Mortgage lenders reported 
  that demand for home purchase loans was unchanged since the previous survey, 
  while demand for refinancings declined. Some lenders are optimistic about growth 
  in home purchase loans heading forward, but virtually all contacts expect refinancings 
  to continue to decline. Commercial real estate activity improved slightly in 
  late April and May. Vacancy rates declined and rents for commercial space rose 
  slightly from the previous survey period in most markets. Commercial real estate 
  agents expect conditions to continue to improve slightly in the months ahead. 
  Commercial construction remained strong, although there were a few reports that 
  high materials costs were resulting in the scaling down or postponement of some 
  projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Bankers reported that both deposits and loans held steady since the last survey, 
  leaving loan-deposit ratios unchanged. Demand rose slightly for commercial real 
  estate loans and construction loans, while demand for home equity loans fell 
  somewhat. On the deposit side, all types of accounts were stable. Nearly all 
  respondents raised their prime lending rates and consumer lending rates since 
  the last survey. Lending standards were unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Energy
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Energy activity continued to expand in the District during late April and May. 
  The count of active oil and gas drilling rigs in the region increased slightly 
  since the prior survey period and remained well above year-ago levels. Many 
  contacts continued to report that shortages of equipment and labor were constraining 
  drilling activity. Drilling is expected to expand further in the months ahead. 
  Mining activity also remains strong in the District, and a recently announced 
  railway expansion is expected to ease delays in the transport of coal from Wyoming's 
  Powder River Basin.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Agricultural conditions in the District deteriorated in late April and May as 
  drought conditions intensified. In some areas, winter wheat production is expected 
  to be roughly 50 percent below last year's level. Because of the expected poor 
  crop, wheat prices are the highest they have been in several years. Cattle producers 
  have also been adversely affected by the extended drought, as deteriorating 
  pasture conditions continued to force early placements of cattle into feedlots. 
  Respondents expressed concerns about high fuel and fertilizer costs, as well 
  as the increasing cost of rail transportation.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Labor Markets and Wages
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Labor markets continued to firm in late April and May, and wage pressures increased 
  somewhat. Hiring announcements once again outpaced layoff announcements by a 
  sizeable margin. Many of the new jobs announced were in the manufacturing sector. 
  In addition, the job market outlook for recent college graduates across the 
  District was reported to be very favorable. The percentage of contacts reporting 
  labor shortages was similar to the previous survey, but the fraction of firms 
  reporting above-normal wage increases rose somewhat. Among the workers reported 
  to be in short supply were engineers, auto technicians, nurses, oil and gas 
  workers, and skilled manufacturing workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Wholesale and retail price pressures generally held steady in late April and 
  May. A slightly higher percentage of manufacturers than in the previous survey 
  reported higher prices for raw materials, including steel and petroleum-based 
  inputs. However, the share of firms reporting higher finished goods prices was 
  little changed and substantially below the share reporting higher materials 
  prices. Also, expectations for future increases in raw materials and finished 
  good prices were about the same as in the previous survey period. Home builders 
  indicated that materials costs were mostly stable, but some builders expect 
  price increases in the months ahead. Both the share of retailers reporting higher 
  prices than a year ago and the share planning price increases in the next several 
  months held steady.
