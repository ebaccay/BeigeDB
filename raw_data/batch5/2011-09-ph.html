      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <strong>
      September 7, 2011
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Since the last Beige Book, business activity in the Third District has been   more mixed and somewhat weaker overall. Several sectors have continued to report   slow, steady growth, and a few sectors have grown faster, while others have   shifted to reporting slower growth, no growth, or declines. Manufacturing   activity has declined since the last Beige Book. Year-over-year sales fell   slightly for general retailers and increased slightly for auto dealers. On   balance, bank lending has remained mostly flat. Residential real estate and   construction was perhaps most impacted by stock market volatility--showing signs   of strength at July's end, then slowing to an unseasonably quiet August.   Commercial real estate contacts have reported steady to slightly improved market   conditions in most parts of the Third District since the previous Beige Book.   Generally positive results were reported by service-sector firms. Upward price   pressures from food, energy, and other commodities have lessened somewhat. The   ability to pass along costs remains mixed, and there is little evidence of wage   pressure.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to ongoing uncertainty, Third District business contacts have   slightly lowered their expectations, with most firms projecting slow to flat   growth for the remainder of the year. Manufacturers forecast a small rise in   shipments and orders during the next six months. Retailers are hopeful for   stronger sales; auto dealers are uncertain. Bankers have lowered their   expectations, as have most residential real estate contacts. Commercial real   estate contacts and service-sector firms have continued to expect slow growth;   however, uncertainty has increased.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Manufacturing
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Since the last Beige Book, the percent of   Third District manufacturers reporting decreases in new orders and shipments has   risen substantially, while the percent reporting increases has fallen slightly.   The general decline in activity was not uniform across sectors. The makers of   food products, fabricated metals, and electronic equipment reported declining   product demand. However, growing product demand was reported by printers and   publishers, by makers of instruments, and by lumber and wood products   manufacturers. Shipments increased, but orders fell for firms reporting in the   primary metals and industrial machinery sectors. Firms experiencing growth cited   foreign markets, growing market share, and product shifts as positive factors.   Declining demand was attributed to sluggish residential construction, softening   domestic consumption, and the falloff in public infrastructure spending. One   industrial supply firm indicated steady growth overall but noted some softness   in sales to those manufacturers most sensitive to business cycles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the outlook among Third District manufacturers remains somewhat   optimistic, it is not as promising as was reported in the last Beige Book. Among   firms contacted, two-fifths expect increases in new orders and shipments over   the next six months, while one-fourth expect decreases. About one-fourth of the   firms polled project increases in capital spending over a six-month planning   horizon--a slightly lower proportion than in the last Beige Book.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Retail
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Third District retailers reported that sales were   generally flat to down compared with a year earlier, although results were more   varied among individual stores across the District. Heavy promotions and   markdowns have been deployed to counter what one retail manager described as   "not a great August." Retailers are looking forward to the extended holiday   shopping season with hopeful optimism.
       </p>
       Auto dealers in the Third District   continue to report some supply disruptions for Japanese-related vehicles and   parts, leading to softer sales in July. Early reports for August were a little   better than July, and better than last year. However, one dealer reported a   customer backing out of a luxury car sale amidst the early August market   volatility. Continued tight supply favors dealers with higher pricing and fewer   promotions. Uncertainty clouds dealers' outlooks.
       <p>
        <strong>
         Finance
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Third District banks contacted in August   indicated soft loan demand, although some bank contacts cited strengths in small   business lending, and in lending to development projects for apartment rentals,   hotels, and commercial retail. More generally, commercial and industrial loan   volumes grew, while consumer and commercial real estate loan volumes shrank. On   balance, total credit extended by banks in the Third District has been generally   flat since the last Beige Book. Most banks report improving credit quality,   while credit standards have changed little. Bank contacts report lowering their   expectations for the remainder of the year--anticipating little growth for all   of 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Real Estate and Construction
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Residential real estate   activity in the Third District has slowed slightly since the previous Beige   Book. Agents reported little traffic and have revised their plans downward for   the remainder of the year. A backlog of foreclosures, the volume of which was   especially large in New Jersey, and flat to slightly falling house prices   continue to dampen demand for new and used homes. Some builders reported signs   of strengthening from mid-July to August, then as financial market volatility   increased, a few deals unwound and traffic ground to a halt. "You could hear the   crickets for two weeks," said one builder, reflecting on the anemic growth even   for a typically slow August. An uptick in refinances was reported; however,   little of the resulting consumer savings is expected to impact housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial and industrial real estate contacts have offered mixed reports in   the Third District since the previous Beige Book. Few reported any interruption   in the normally slow August activity due to financial market volatility. Slow,   steady growth was observed with vacancy rates generally falling, rents steady or   occasionally rising, and concessions steady or occasionally falling. Demand for   residential rental properties has been generating the most new business as   reported by architecture, engineering, and property management firms. Several   contacts also noted activity finally re-emerging from the life sciences sector.   The outlook expressed by market participants is for continued slow growth in   nonresidential real estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Services
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Reports from Third District service-sector firms   remain generally positive, but with greater expressions of uncertainty. A   logistics firm described business as surprisingly strong--improving since the   last Beige Book and better than last year. Staffing firms noted an increase in   temporary hiring to fill permanent positions--indicating increased uncertainty   among their customers. In addition to the impact from anticipated troop   reductions, defense-related firms noted concerns stemming from the debt-ceiling   agreement. While growth remains generally steady, greater uncertainty has crept   into the generally positive outlook of service-sector firms.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Prices and Wages
        </strong>
        <br/>
        Since the previous Beige Book, the   percent of manufacturers reporting increases in prices paid for inputs has   continued to fall slightly from one-third to one-fourth. Over the same period,   the percent reporting decreases in prices received for their own products rose   slightly from one-sixth to over one-fifth. Since the last Beige Book, commodity   price pressures have lessened somewhat on retailers, service-sector firms, and   builders; however, margins remain very tight. But for a few business sectors or   a few scattered rental markets, there are scant reports of upward pressure on   rents and wages.
