      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
      <p>
       The economy of the Eighth District has expanded modestly since our previous   report. Manufacturing activity decreased, while activity in the services sector   continued to increase. Retail and auto sales in January and early February   increased over year-earlier levels. Home sales continued to decline across the   District, and commercial real estate conditions remained slow. Overall lending   at a sample of large District banks saw little change during the fourth quarter   of 2010.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Contacts reported that retail sales in   January and early February were up, on average, over year-earlier levels. Half   of the retailers saw increases in sales, while 25 percent saw decreases and 25   percent saw no changes. About half of the respondents noted that sales levels   met their expectations, 33 percent reported that sales were below expectations,   and 17 percent reported that sales were above expectations. About 38 percent of   the contacts noted that their inventories were too high, while 21 percent   reported that their inventories were too low. The sales outlook among the   retailers for March and April was mostly optimistic. About 58 percent of the   retailers expect sales to increase over 2010 levels, while 12 percent expect   sales to decrease and 30 percent expect sales to remain unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       Car dealers in the District reported that sales in January and early February   were up, on average, compared with last year's sales. About 71 percent of the   car dealers surveyed saw increases in sales, while 12 percent saw decreases and   17 percent saw no changes. One-third of the car dealers noted that used car   sales had increased relative to new car sales, while 5 percent reported the   opposite. Also, about 30 percent of contacts reported an increase in sales of   low-end vehicles relative to high-end vehicles, while less than 5 percent   reported the opposite. About 46 percent of the car dealers surveyed reported   that their inventories were at desired levels, while 25 percent reported that   their inventories were too high. The sales outlook among the car dealers for   March and April was generally optimistic. Almost 92 percent of the car dealers   expect sales to increase over 2010 levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Other Business Activity
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing   activity has decreased since our previous report. Several manufacturers reported   plans to close plants and reduce operations in the near future, while a smaller   number of contacts reported plans to open plants or expand operations. Firms in   the wood products, automobile parts, aircraft, and primary metal manufacturing   industries reported plans to decrease operations and lay off workers.   Additionally, a major firm in tire manufacturing announced plans to close a   plant in the District and lay off workers. In contrast, firms in the medical   equipment, automobile parts, and primary metal manufacturing industries   announced plans to expand existing operations and hire new employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's services sector continued to improve since our previous   report. Contacts in the legal services, commercial printing, entertainment,   support activities for air transportation, and business support services   industries reported plans to expand existing operations in the District and hire   new employees. In contrast, contacts in government services and religious   organizations announced plans to decrease operations and lay off workers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Home sales continued to   decline throughout most of the Eighth District. Compared with the same period in   2010, January 2011 home sales were down 6 percent in Louisville and Little Rock,   1 percent in St. Louis, and 8 percent Memphis. However, 2010 single-family   housing permits increased in the majority of the District metro areas compared   with 2009. Permits increased 3 percent in Little Rock, 4 percent in St. Louis,   and 2 percent in Memphis but decreased 9 percent in Louisville. Commercial and   industrial real estate market conditions throughout the District remained soft.   Compared with the third quarter of 2010, fourth-quarter 2010 industrial vacancy   rates decreased in Little Rock and St. Louis, increased in Memphis, and remained   unchanged in Louisville. During the same period, suburban office vacancy rates   increased in Louisville, Memphis, and Little Rock, while they remained constant   in St. Louis. The downtown office vacancy rates increased in Louisville, Little   Rock, and Memphis but decreased in St. Louis. Commercial and industrial   construction activity continues to be slow throughout most of the District.   Contacts in Louisville reported that demand for commercial properties remains   low. Contacts in northwest Arkansas reported that banks are very cautious in   considering new development projects. Contacts in Louisville noted no new   suburban construction completions, while contacts in St. Louis reported limited   commercial construction. Contacts in Memphis, St. Louis, and Louisville expect   speculative construction activity to remain weak. Nevertheless, contacts in   south-central Kentucky reported that a few plant expansions are in progress, and   a contact in western Kentucky noted some commercial regional projects are under   way.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       A survey of senior loan officers at a   sample of large District banks showed little change in overall lending activity   during the fourth quarter of 2010. During this period, credit standards for   commercial and industrial loans remained unchanged, while demand for these loans   ranged from unchanged to moderately weaker. Credit standards for commercial real   estate loans tightened somewhat, while demand for these loans was moderately   weaker. Meanwhile, credit standards for consumer loans remained unchanged, while   demand for these loans ranged from about the same to moderately stronger. Credit   standards for residential mortgage loans ranged from unchanged to tightened   somewhat, while demand for these loans was moderately weaker.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Natural Resources
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Annual figures for 2010   in the District's agricultural sector showed a shortfall of 2 percent or more in   corn, soybean, rice, hay, and tobacco yields, compared with 2009. Cotton and   winter wheat yields, however, rose by 2 percent or more from 2009 to 2010.   Meanwhile, total production of corn, soybeans, sorghum, winter wheat, hay, and   tobacco for 2010 was at least 4 percent lower than in 2009. In contrast, total   production of rice increased by 18 percent and total production of cotton   increased by 50 percent. Coal production for the District states at the end of   January 2011 was 7 percent higher than a year ago.
