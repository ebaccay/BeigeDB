      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 12, 2011
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that economic   activity rose moderately in late November and December. Holiday sales were   described as generally positive and above expectations. Tourism contacts noted   increases for both business and leisure travel. Weakness continued to be   reported in the real estate sector as both builders and brokers noted very low   levels of activity. Most manufacturers noted a slight increase in new orders and   production levels, although those producing construction-related goods continued   to experience lower activity. Transportation companies reported moderating   freight volumes after significant increases earlier this year. Business contacts   continued to report that obtaining loans at acceptable terms has remained   difficult, especially for small businesses and start-ups. Bankers repeated that   they experienced a lack of loan demand from qualified borrowers. Employment   indicators continued to recover, albeit slowly. Most business contacts said that   they remain hesitant to add to their permanent workforce until they experienced   a sustained increase in sales. A majority of business contacts indicated that   current cost pressures remained high, citing increasing material prices and   rising labor and benefits outlays. However, most firms remained reluctant to   pass input cost increases through to consumers given intense competitive   pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending and Tourism
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Many District retail stores   noted that holiday sales were above their expectations. Most indicated that   traffic and sales increased compared with a year ago; however, smaller retailers   reported less of an increase in business than larger stores. The majority of   businesses contacted noted that sales were driven by a mixture of discounting   and stronger demand. The outlook among merchants remained optimistic. District   automobile dealers indicated that vehicle sales improved recently and were ahead   of year-ago levels. Sales of commercial trucks were also up modestly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourism activity increased slightly relative to a year ago for both business   and leisure travel and the outlook remained modestly positive going into 2011.   Hotel occupancy rates rose in several of the District's major markets compared   with last year. Cruise lines reported an increase in both bookings and pricing   power.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Real Estate and Construction
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Reports from most District   homebuilders indicated that the pace of new home sales growth through December   remained weak compared with a year ago. Many contacts continued to report that   buyers were having a difficult time securing loans. Builders also noted   construction activity held steady at very low levels. The outlook was mixed with   Florida and Georgia builders expecting weaker activity over the next several   months, while elsewhere in the District modest improvements were expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential broker reports indicated that the pace of existing home sales   growth remained weak compared with a year ago, but declines were more modest   than in recent reports. Contacts also indicated that home sales at the low-end   of the market weakened notably. Throughout the region, short-sales, REOs, and   pending foreclosures continued to put downward pressure on home prices which   remained below year-earlier levels in most areas. Realtor outlooks for sales   growth over the next several months improved somewhat from previous reports.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonresidential construction activity remained at low levels through the end   of the year. Commercial contractors said that the pace of development and   backlogs remained below the year-earlier level. Contacts indicated that access   to funding remained challenging and competition for projects had become more   intense. Many indicated that they expected the commercial market to remain   constrained in 2011.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Manufacturing and Transportation
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Sixth District   manufacturers reported a modest increase in new orders and production levels,   while finished inventories contracted only slightly. Several respondents   expressed plans to increase production in the short-term. Goods producers tied   to the construction sector continued to report very low levels of activity.   Manufacturing-related transportation companies reported moderating freight   volumes after significant increases earlier this year. Regional rail shipments   of farm products increased since the last report, nearly reaching double their   year-ago level, while shipments of motor vehicles and equipment declined. The   outlook among transportation firms remains optimistic for 2011 as moderate   growth in shipments is expected for the first half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Banking and Finance
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Some surveys indicated that credit   standards have eased somewhat in recent months, but remained tight compared with   pre-recession levels. Business contacts continued to report that obtaining loans   on acceptable terms has remained difficult, especially for new and small   businesses. Small businesses whose balance sheets were damaged by the recession   reported difficulty qualifying for loans even though their financial situation   had improved. Meanwhile, bankers continued to report a lack of loan demand from   qualified borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Employment and Prices
      </strong>
      <br/>
      District labor markets continued to   recover, albeit slowly. Business contacts reported that their hiring plans for   2011 have not changed with most remaining hesitant to add to their permanent   labor force until they experienced a sustained increase in sales. District firms   continued to note a preference for increasing existing staff hours and using   part-time or temporary staff. Nevertheless, some contacts noted that they plan   to expand their workforce in 2011 at a conservative pace in response to   increased output, store openings, or replacing employees lost to attrition or   retirement.
     </p>
     <p>
      A majority of business contacts indicated that current cost pressures were   higher, citing increasing material prices and rising labor and benefit costs.   Many firms also noted that they were setting aside funds for expected future   increases in employment taxes and healthcare costs. However, firms remained   reluctant to pass input cost increases through to consumers given intense   competitive pressures. Nearly all contacts noted that markups were either near   or below what they considered to be normal, reporting that increased   productivity has placed some downward pressure on product prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Natural Resources and Agriculture
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Regional oil production   reached its highest level in over six years in the fourth quarter of 2010 as   increased output from offshore platforms boosted production. Although drilling   activity remained well below pre-oil spill levels, the number of rigs operating   in the Gulf of Mexico has crept up since hurricane season ended. Contacts   continued to note that the lower pace of drilling permit issuance and additional   rig inspections could weigh on future energy output in the Gulf.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the Southeast continued to experience varying degrees of prolonged   drought. Reports also indicated that both the lack of rain and   colder-than-average temperatures have presented challenges to Florida citrus   growers. The drought has reduced the physical size of the fruit slightly, and   the recent cold snaps have affected young new plantings. Supplies of both cotton   and soybeans continue to be tight with strong global demand keeping prices   high.
