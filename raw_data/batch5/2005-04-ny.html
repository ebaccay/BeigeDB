      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <b>
       April 20, 2005
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Second District's economy has continued to grow, on balance, since the last report, with considerable variation across sectors.  There have been increasing signs of price pressures in some industries.  Manufacturers report a slowing in growth of activity and note fairly widespread increases in input costs but only a moderate escalation in selling prices.   Retailers indicate that March sales were on or below plan, largely reflecting unfavorable weather; however, hotels and other tourist-related businesses continue to report pronounced strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential real estate markets were extraordinarily robust in the first quarter and that strength appears to be carrying over into the current quarter.  Office and industrial markets were moderately stronger in the first quarter.  Although the securities industry showed strong growth in activity, revenues and profits in the first quarter, business has slowed noticeably in recent weeks; escalating input costs are reported in the industry.  Finally, bankers report continued modest declines in delinquency rates; they also indicate steady to slower loan demand from the household sector but increased demand for commercial loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Retailers report that sales were mostly below plan in March, held down by unseasonably cold and wet weather; most contacts also surmise that their customers have been pinched by high energy costs.  Compared with a year earlier, same-store sales ranged from a 4 percent gain to a 13 percent decline, despite the early date for Easter, which was expected to boost apparel sales.  Sales of lawn and garden merchandise, casual apparel and other seasonal goods were described as especially weak, while goods for the home were generally characterized as sluggish.  Though one contact indicates some overhang, inventories were generally said to be at desired levels.  Retail chains indicate that selling prices have risen slightly, though this is partly attributed to a gradual shift in the sales mix towards more upscale goods.  Consumer confidence retreated in March, based on the Conference Board's survey of Middle Atlantic state (NY, NJ, PA) residents.
     </p>
     <p>
      Indicators of tourism, primarily in New York City, signaled exceptional strength 

  in the first quarter. Manhattan's hotel occupancy rate was nearly 7 percentage 

  points higher in February than a year ago, and total revenues were up more than 

  20 percent; there are indications that March was almost as strong. Hotels in 

  the Buffalo-Niagara Falls area also report that occupancy rates were up noticeably 

  in early 2005 compared with a year earlier. Broadway theaters report a sharp 

  pickup in activity since the last report: in March, attendance was up 7 percent 

  from a year earlier, while revenues were up 9 percent, with the strongest gains 

  coming at the end of the month. Two major Manhattan department stores report 

  that brisk tourism has buoyed their sales. Passenger traffic at district airports 

  is reported to be increasingly robust—volume at New York City area airports 

  recently rose above pre-9/11 levels, with one airport currently said to be at 

  full capacity; Buffalo's airport also reports brisk passenger traffic. Very 

  strong growth is also reported in bridge and tunnel traffic.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Housing markets appear to have gained further momentum in March. Contacts in 

  Manhattan's real estate industry report 15 to 20 percent price appreciation 

  for apartments over the past year and 6 to 10 percent increases in unit sales. 

  The inventory of homes on the market is said to be lean and little changed from 

  a year ago, and units are staying on the market for an unusually short time. 

  One large real estate firm reports that March was their strongest month ever, 

  in terms of revenue, and that bidding wars remain fairly common. Another contact 

  notes that several large mortgage lenders will soon be entering the New York 

  City market. Demand for single family homes across New York State has shown 

  persistent strength in early 2005—though sales volume has tapered off somewhat 

  recently, prices have continued to appreciate at a double-digit rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial real estate markets across the New York City metro area strengthened moderately in the first quarter.  Office markets in Manhattan and northern New Jersey tightened in the first quarter, with vacancy rates declining and rents rising; some softening in Lower Manhattan's market was more than offset by further strength in the Midtown and Midtown South areas.  Sales of office space weakened slightly in Northern New Jersey, but continued to strengthen in both Lower and Midtown Manhattan.  Office vacancy rates edged up in Long Island and Westchester and Fairfield Counties but were still down from a year earlier, while rents were up modestly.  Sales of office buildings were reported to be exceptionally strong in both Lower and Midtown Manhattan, though some weakening was reported in northern New Jersey.  Industrial markets also strengthened: compared with a year earlier, vacancy rates were down and industrial rents were up nearly 7 percent across the New York City metropolitan region.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Manufacturing contacts report a loss of momentum in March and early April.  The April Empire State Manufacturing Survey indicates a leveling off in activity.  Many manufacturing contacts cite soaring energy prices as a major concern.  More broadly, though, while respondents continue to note widespread increases in input costs, selling prices are reported to be stable to up moderately.  Purchasing managers report mixed results for March: those in the New York City and Rochester areas indicate some leveling off in activity and steady costs for manufacturing inputs; however, purchasers in the Buffalo area note an acceleration in business activity and persistent widespread cost pressures.  There are reports of expansion in Long Island's defense industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The securities industry, which had shown brisk growth in activity, revenues 

  and profits in the first quarter, is reported to have weakened noticeably starting 

  in mid-March and continuing into April, portending a second quarter slowdown. 

  An industry contact reports fairly rapid escalation in wages and costs of most 

  business inputs—consultants, auditing, printing, software engineering and other 

  business and professional services, as well as catering and various business 

  supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small to medium-sized banks in the Second District report increased overall 

  demand for commercial loans and
      <br/>
      non-residential mortgages, but little change 

  in demand from the household sector. Bankers again indicate declines in refinancing 

  activity. Little or no change is reported in credit standards, except for commercial 

  and industrial loans, where there was some tightening, on balance. Respondents 

  report widespread increases in interest rates, both on deposits and loans—particularly 

  on commercial mortgages and commercial and industrial loans. Finally, bankers 

  report declining overall delinquency rates, with 17 percent reporting overall 

  decreases and no bankers reporting increased delinquencies in any loan category.
