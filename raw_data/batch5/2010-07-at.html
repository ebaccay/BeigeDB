      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <strong>
      July 28, 2010
     </strong>
     <p>
      <p>
       Reports from Sixth District business contacts indicated that the pace of   economic activity slowed somewhat in June and early July. Retailers reported a   slight increase in traffic and sales, but their outlook was less optimistic than   the last report. Tourism reports were generally positive, however, significant   concerns were expressed over the potential impact from the oil spill on the Gulf   coast. Residential real estate contacts suggested that the pace of new and   existing home sales slowed, and their outlook was pessimistic. Commercial real   estate remained weak. Manufacturers saw a slight deceleration in activity as the   pace of new orders and production growth slowed. Banking credit conditions   remained tight and loan demand was subdued. Businesses continued to increase the   hours worked of existing staff and to expand their use of temporary hires.   Permanent hires were less apparent. Transportation and material costs rose   slightly, but most firms expressed no intention of passing these increases along   to consumers.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Consumer Spending and Tourism
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Most District merchants   noticed a slight increase in traffic and sales in June and early July. Retailers   also mentioned that despite the uptick in sales, they continued to keep   inventory levels low. Although most merchants have reported improved conditions   since the beginning of the year, sales levels remained well below pre-recession   levels. The outlook among retailers was more subdued than in previous months.   Automotive dealers reported that sales improved from a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Overall, tourism continued to show signs of improvement compared with last   year. Reports from Miami and New Orleans indicated that business-related travel   and convention bookings remained positive. Leisure travel was positive in most   District destinations except for the Gulf coast where significant concerns were   reported over the oil spill and its impact on tourism. Hospitality contacts in   the area remarked that some cancelled bookings have been substituted by the   presence of clean-up crews, oil company workers, and the National Guard.   Contacts not located along the Gulf coast have stated that there have been   increased bookings as a result of deflected business from oil-affected   areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       District residential real   estate brokers and homebuilders reported that home sales weakened notably in   June and early July on a year-over-year basis. Contacts also indicated that   sales fell on a month-over-month basis. However, several brokers remarked that   June sales were boosted by closings associated with the housing stimulus. Buyer   traffic continued to soften across the region. Realtors noted that existing home   inventories rose outside of Florida on a year-over-year basis, while Florida   inventories declined modestly. Similar inventory trends were seen on a   month-over-month basis. New home inventories remained below the year-earlier   level, and construction activity softened from already weak levels. Both   Realtors and builders shared concerns about the housing market going forward;   the outlook weakened and sales growth over the next several months is   anticipated to be slightly negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nonresidential construction activity continued to be weak. The majority of   contacts noted that the pace of commercial development was below the   year-earlier level and backlogs remained at low levels. Vacancy rates were high   across the District and contacts witnessed downward pressure on rents. The   outlook for the rest of the year remained negative.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing and Transportation
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Almost half of District   manufacturers contacted stated that new orders and production grew at a slower   pace in June than in the previous report. The number of firms experiencing   higher levels of orders decreased notably compared with the previous report,   while the number of contacts planning to expand production in the near future   dropped as well. Freight activity remained above weak year-earlier levels, led   by increased shipments of motor vehicles, metals, and chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Banking and Finance
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Industry reports indicated that   banking conditions weakened across much of the District. Several bankers   reported that credit remained available to qualified customers. Consumers seemed   reluctant to take on additional debt, however. Contacts also cited declining   credit card use as consumers continued to deleverage. Business loan demand was   also muted.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Employment and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Private payroll employment   increased slightly through early July across the District, although many   businesses maintained a strong preference for increasing existing staff hours   and using temporary staff rather than hiring full-time, permanent employees. In   addition, the outlook regarding labor market conditions along the Gulf coast   remained tempered by the impact from the oil spill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite reports of raw materials and transportation cost increases, most   firms conveyed no plans to pass the increases on to consumers. Several contacts   remarked that excess production capacity and competition continued to put   downward pressure on prices in a variety of sectors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Natural Resources and Agriculture
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Local energy prices and   oil production have remained mostly stable since the onset of the oil spill in   late April. Gulf of Mexico crude inventories continued to hover near the top of   their average range for this time of year. Nonetheless, a number of businesses   expressed concern about the potential impact on long-term energy production and   employment from the deepwater drilling moratorium. Industry reports noted   recertification of deep and shallow water rigs/wells was underway. Meanwhile,   contacts indicated that Gulf ports were operating normally and commerce along   the Mississippi River remained uninterrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dry conditions and high daytime temperatures have resulted in some crop   stress in parts of the District, but conditions overall continued to be good for   cotton and citrus crops. Cotton plantings have increased on a year-over-year   basis.
