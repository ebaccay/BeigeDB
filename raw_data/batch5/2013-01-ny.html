      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 2013
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Second District has shown signs of rebounding since the   last report, as widespread disruptions from Superstorm Sandy largely dissipated.   On balance, the labor market firmed, with manufacturers reporting flat   employment but non-manufacturing contacts indicating some pickup in hiring.   Manufacturers and other firms report more widespread price hikes than in recent   months, while retail prices were steady to up moderately. Retailers report that   holiday-season sales were steady to somewhat higher than this time last year but   slightly below plan. Auto sales in upstate New York were mixed but generally   strong in November and December. Tourism activity slumped in November, in the   aftermath of Sandy, but rebounded somewhat in New York City in December. Both   residential and commercial real estate markets were generally steady since the   last report. Finally, bankers report a pickup in demand for commercial mortgages   but steady demand on other types of loans; they also report no change in credit   standards, narrowing loan spreads, and widespread decreases in delinquency   rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Consumer Spending
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Holiday season sales were up modestly   from last year but came in slightly below plan. A trade association survey of   retailers across New York State indicates that sales were disappointing in the   days leading up to Christmas as well as in the days after. A major retail chain   indicates that sales were below plan in November and December but picked up   fairly dramatically in early January. Retail contacts in upstate New York report   that sales were flat to up compared to a year earlier. Retailers attribute the   weaker than expected holiday sales to a combination of online shopping, mild   weather, fiscal cliff concerns, and, in some parts of the region, slow insurance   payouts to those affected by Sandy.Â  Retail prices were reported to be steady or   up moderately.
     </p>
     <p>
      Buffalo-area auto dealers indicate that vehicle sales picked up in November   but were expected to be flat to slightly lower than a year earlier in December.   However, Rochester-area dealers report strong sales for both months to end 2012.   Tourism activity slumped in the immediate aftermath of Sandy. Even hotels in the   Albany area were reportedly affected by the storm, as widespread meeting and   conference cancellations pushed down hotel occupancy rates in November. In New   York City, Broadway theaters report that attendance and revenues rebounded after   a deep post-Sandy slump in the first half of November. Still, December   attendance was down 5 to10 percent from a year earlier, while revenues were   little changed. Finally, consumer confidence in the region weakened at year end.   The Conference Board's survey of residents of the Middle Atlantic states (NY,   NJ, Pa) showed confidence falling to its lowest level in more than a year, while   Siena College's survey of New York State residents indicated a modest decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Construction and Real Estate
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Residential real estate   markets in the District were generally steady since the last report, with the   storm having little discernible effect on the overall market. New York City's   rental market appears to have lost some momentum during the final two months of   2012, as rents in Manhattan and Brooklyn retreated and were up only slightly   from a year earlier. The inventory of available rental apartments, however,   remained low in late 2012. Apartment sales activity in New York City was robust   in the fourth quarter--particularly in Manhattan. A major appraisal firm   attributes some of the high sales volume to looming tax changes and notes that   there has been a flood of appraisal requests for tax-related financial planning.   Prices are reported to be flat to up slightly. In contrast, an overhang of   inventory has kept prices from rising in northern New Jersey and Long Island.   Sandy disrupted construction activity in late 2012, though a contact in the   homebuilding industry notes that construction sub-contractors are getting a   great deal of work from storm-related repairs and reconstruction during a   typically slow season.
     </p>
     <p>
      Office markets were relatively stable in the final months of 2012. A   commercial real estate contact reports that the recovery from Sandy in Lower   Manhattan has been slow, as a number of buildings in the flood zone remained out   of service at year end. More broadly, leasing and sales activity across   Manhattan were sluggish in November but picked up in December. Vacancy rates   have been steady, while asking rents have edged up, led by brisk gains in   Midtown South. Strong demand from the new media and advertising sectors and some   pickup from legal services have offset weak demand from the financial sector.   Elsewhere in the region, vacancy rates were little changed in the fourth   quarter, though asking rents fell noticeably in northern New Jersey.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Other Business Activity
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Contacts in the manufacturing   sector continue to report little or no growth in activity though they remain   mildly optimistic about the near-term outlook. Non-manufacturing contacts report   some improvement in business conditions and have grown increasingly optimistic   about prospects for 2013. New York City area firms--both manufacturing firmsÂ    and non-manufacturing firms--say that Sandy adversely affected revenues in   November but that business was seen to be back on track in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, labor market conditions firmed in late 2012. While business   contacts in the manufacturing sector report little or no change in employment,   contacts in other sectors note some pickup in hiring. A major New York City   employment agency specializing in office jobs said that while it is difficult to   assess the labor market during the holiday season some continued softness in   labor market conditions is apparent. In particular, financial sector hiring has   remained sluggish, but year-end bonuses are expected to be up moderately from a   year ago. Much of the bonus pay typically distributed in January was reportedly   paid out in December in advance of higher tax rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Financial Developments
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Small- to medium-sized banks   report no change in demand for all loan types except commercial mortgages, where   loan demand increased. Bankers report little change in demand for refinancing.   The vast majority of respondents continue to report that credit standards were   unchanged across all categories. Respondents indicate a decrease in spreads of   loan rates over the costs of funds for all loan categories--particularly in   residential mortgages, where nearly three in five bankers report lower spreads.   Respondents also indicate a decrease in average deposit rates, on balance.   Finally, bankers note declining delinquency rates in all loan categories--most   notably in commercial mortgages, where well over half of those surveyed report   lower delinquencies.
