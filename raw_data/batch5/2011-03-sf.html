      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 2, 2011
      </strong>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the Twelfth District posted further gains during the   reporting period of mid-January through mid-February. Despite notable price   increases for assorted raw materials and commodities, overall price pressures   for final goods and services remained modest, as did wage gains. Sales of retail   items and services expanded relative to seasonal norms. District manufacturing   activity continued to grow at a solid pace overall. Agricultural producers   reported robust sales, and providers of energy resources continued to expand on   net. Activity in District housing markets remained very subdued, and demand for   commercial real estate stayed weak overall. Reports from District banking   contacts indicated modest increases in loan demand and increased interest in   lending to smaller businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Wages and Prices
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Price increases for final goods and   services remained modest overall during the reporting period. Further increases   were noted for an assortment of raw materials and commodities, such as oil,   grains, cotton, lumber, and various metals, along with finished apparel and   other products sourced from overseas. However, stiff competition among domestic   firms, combined with continued low levels of demand, generally precluded   pass-through of cost increases to final prices for retail goods and services,   with the notable exceptions of gasoline and groceries. Looking ahead, contacts   in most sectors expect that prices for their products will increase modestly   over the next six months, with larger gains expected for food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upward wage pressures generally were quite modest, held down by high   unemployment and limited demand for new employees in most sectors. Scattered   reports pointed to continued downward wage pressures, but contacts more   generally reported modest planned wage increases for 2011, in the aftermath of   widespread wage freezes over the past few years. Wage gains remained most   pronounced for workers with specialized technical skills, especially in   information technology fields.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Retail Trade and Services
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Retail sales continued to   improve relative to seasonal norms. Although consumers remained oriented toward   spending on necessities and lower-priced options, the reports pointed to a   gradual shift back toward discretionary spending. Discount retail chains and   traditional department stores alike reported modest increases in sales, with   inventories that were close to desired levels. By contrast, conditions remained   challenging for sellers of furniture and major appliances, and grocers reported   that their pace of sales slowed somewhat. Demand for new automobiles continued   to strengthen, although higher-than-expected sales in December left some dealers   with depleted inventories and an inability to fully meet demand in January.   Sales of used vehicles remained robust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for consumer and business services improved further overall. Sales   rose significantly for providers of technology services, spurred in part by   rising demand for digital media services used for mobile communication devices.   Demand for transportation services continued to expand, and suppliers of energy   services reported additional growth in deliveries to households and businesses.   Customer traffic rose further for restaurants and other food-service providers.   Contacts noted ongoing improvements in business travel and tourism activity. By   contrast, demand remained largely flat for providers of health-care services and   also professional services, such as law and accounting.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Manufacturing
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Manufacturing activity in the District   showed further solid growth during the reporting period of mid-January through   mid-February. Demand continued to expand for manufacturers of semiconductors and   other technology products, with reports pointing to robust sales, high levels of   capacity utilization, and inventories near targeted levels given the pace of   sales. For makers of commercial aircraft and parts, modest increases in new   orders combined with an existing order backlog to keep production rates high.   Demand grew further for metal fabricators, with ongoing order backlogs and   extended lead times noted. Utilization rates at petroleum refineries were above   their levels from twelve months earlier, despite elevated gasoline inventories.   Demand remained weak for manufacturers of wood products.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Agriculture and Resource-related Industries
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand was   robust for agricultural products and improved on balance for natural resources   used for energy production. Sales and orders continued to grow for assorted   crops and livestock products, although revenue growth has been partly offset by   rising input costs, particularly for fertilizer and livestock feed. Rising   export sales boosted activity somewhat for timber companies. Strong global   demand continued to support an increase in oil extraction activity during the   reporting period, and extraction activity for natural gas remained largely   stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Real Estate and Construction
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Demand for housing in the   District appeared to be little changed from the previous reporting period, and   demand for commercial real estate remained at very low levels. The pace of home   sales continued to be feeble throughout the District. In response to sluggish   sales, new home construction has remained at depressed levels, although a few   reports pointed to tentative signs of a pickup in the planning phases for new   construction. Demand for rental space continued to expand in some areas,   eliminating prior downward pressure on rents in some cases. Conditions in   commercial real estate markets generally remained weak, as vacancy rates stayed   at elevated levels in many parts of the District. However, further improvements   in leasing activity, with tenants increasingly committing to longer-term leases,   were noted for some of the District"s major markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Financial Institutions
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Reports from District banking   contacts indicated that loan demand was up somewhat compared with prior   reporting periods. Although businesses reportedly remained cautious in regard to   their capital spending plans, demand for commercial and industrial loans rose a   bit. Demand for consumer credit grew modestly as well. A few reports indicated   that lenders' willingness to extend credit to small and medium-sized businesses   improved in recent weeks, which respondents attributed primarily to perceived   improvements in the outlook for existing business plans. Nonetheless, lending   standards for consumer and business lending remained relatively restrictive.   Venture capital financing showed further signs of improvement, with contacts   noting ongoing increases in investor interest and IPO activity.
