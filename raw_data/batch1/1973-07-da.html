      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 11, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The economy of the Eleventh District continues to expand with almost 
all major economic indicators showing greater strength. The only 
notable exception is the unemployment rate, which edged up slightly 
in May. Industrial production in Texas reached another record level 
in May, and the pace of construction activity picked up 
substantially. Sales of District department stores also rose further 
in May and June, and automobile registrations rebounded sharply from 
April's decline. A survey of major District retailers indicates that 
the price freeze has had little effect on their business operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast majority of the retailers surveyed felt that their sales, 
adjusted for seasonal factors, would be at least as strong in the 
second half of 1973 as in the first half. Moreover, the price freeze 
has so far had no effect on their sales. None of the retailers 
reported their current inventory-to-sales ratio as being abnormally 
low, and none reported any effort to take advantage of the price 
freeze to accelerate inventory buying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of the retailers also indicated that the current price 
freeze has had no discernible effect on their company's profit 
margin. Most of the remaining respondents reporting any effect felt 
that their profit margins are moderately smaller than they would 
have been without the freeze. The retailers, on the average, 
reported no change in the extent to which their customers are using 
credit in their purchases, and they noticed no change in the quality 
mix of goods their customers buy. The recent increase in commercial 
bank lending rates have not influenced retailers to use less bank 
credit. Almost all report no change in their bank borrowings as a 
result of the interest rate increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seasonally adjusted Texas Industrial Production Index rose 
further in May, as gains were posted in all three major sectors. In 
manufacturing, the largest production increases occurred in 
petroleum refining, food and food products, primary metals, and 
stone, clay and glass products. Mining rose mainly as a result of 
increases in output of crude oil, and metal, stone and earth 
minerals. Utilities edged up only slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       With imports of foreign crude helping to ease the supply shortage, 
District refineries are turning out record amounts of gasoline. The 
gasoline shortage has not proven to be as severe as originally 
feared, although some companies warn that there may still be some 
local shortages due to distribution problems. A few municipalities, 
particularly Austin, continue to face energy shortages, as natural 
gas supplies have been curtailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seasonally adjusted total employment in the five District states 
rebounded in May, regaining most of the loss of the month before. 
The labor force grew at a slightly faster pace than employment, 
however, causing the unemployment rate to edge up to 3.9 percent 
from April's 3.8 percent. Manufacturing employment remained 
unchanged, while nonmanufacturing employment rose slightly, as 
substantial gains were recorded in finance and services.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of construction contracts awarded in the five District 
states increased in May as residential building contracts rose to 
their highest level since August 1972. Nonresidential building rose 
only slightly, while nonbuilding construction fell from April. The 
cumulative value of contracts awarded through May was only 1.3 
percent above the corresponding period last year, primarily due to 
the sharp year-to-year decline in nonbuilding construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of department stores in the District continued to show 
substantial increases over the year-ago level in June. Cumulative 
sales for the first half of the year were 12 percent above the level 
for the corresponding period last year. The number of new automobile 
registrations for the four largest metropolitan areas of Texasâ€”Dallas, Forth Worth, Houston, and San Antonioâ€”rebounded sharply 
in May with particularly strong year-to-year increases in Dallas 
and Forth Worth. Cumulative car registrations through May were over 
a fifth higher than in 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agricultural outlook in the Eleventh District is favorable. 
Increased field activity has closed the lag in planting and 
harvesting created by the earlier bad weather. The wheat harvest in 
Texas is nearing completion with yields good to excellent. Oklahoma 
is also making rapid advances in its wheat harvestâ€”although 
average moisture content continues somewhat higher than usual and 
protein content is down somewhat. Livestock conditions are generally 
good. However, the screwworm regulations governing interstate 
shipments of livestock were recently extended to include Arizona and 
New Mexico. This action was necessary because of serious fly 
spillover from Mexico into Arizona and to some extent into New 
Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>
       The price freeze has caused serious distortions in both the 
livestock and poultry industries. Placements of cattle on feed have 
dropped significantly because of the squeeze between the cost of 
feeding cattle and the price received for slaughter cattle. As a 
result, spokesmen for the cattle industry expect a shortage of beef 
this fall. In addition, the latest production figures for Texas 
poultry are bleak, with Texas broiler egg sets down 15 percent in 
the last half of June from a year earlier. Dairymen, also faced with 
high feed costs, are reported to be culling their herds to eliminate 
marginal producers.
