      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 13, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Economic activity in the District appears to be weakening. New car 
sales are down sharply, and department store sales are softening. 
New orders are declining and layoffs increasing in the industrial 
sector. Residential construction continues to decline sharply. At 
the same time, the machine tool, mining equipment, general 
industrial machinery, and steel industries are still sources of 
considerable near-term strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       New car dealers in the Greater Cleveland area report that sales in 
October declined 23 percent from the year-ago level. An official 
with one of Cleveland's large department stores said sales in the 
past few weeks have softened further. He attributes this in part to 
the considerable publicity given to inflation and recession. Sales 
of hard goods are especially weak; apparel sales, particularly 
winter clothing, have been below expectations. Inventories are on 
the high side, reflecting a rapid improvement in delivery and 
softening in sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing agents in the Cleveland area report a deterioration in 
business conditions during October, with declines in new orders and 
production. Lead times for production materials and supplies 
continue to improve. Purchasing agents report a moderation in the 
frequency and magnitude of price increases for the second 
consecutive month. Early returns from our monthly survey of District 
manufacturers indicate a sharp reduction in new orders during 
October, following some softening in September. Backlogs have 
started to decline, and inventory accumulation is showing signs of 
subsiding. Delivery times are becoming shorter. Employment and hours 
declined in October. In addition, a number of major firms plan to
      </p>
      cut employment in November; these include autos, appliances, 
building materials, aluminum, aerospace, and a few machinery 
companies.
      <p>
       <p>
        Steel mills continue to operate at maximum capacity. A reduction in 
steel demand for appliances, housing, and commercial construction 
has been offset by other steel users. Auto producers generally are 
still buying heavily and are taking the maximum tonnage allotted to 
them. One major auto firm has reduced orders, but the amounts 
involved have not been significant. A steel industry economist says 
that automotive demand for steel has held up, despite production 
cutbacks, because of inventory hedging against a coal strike, which 
will curtail steel output. There are, however, a growing number of 
other steel customers who are deferring orders because of excessive 
inventories. Customer stocks are somewhat above normal, and the 
pressure for delivery is now less intense than it had been.
       </p>
       <p>
        District coal mining operations have been at capacity because of 
heavy demands from all major users. Coal demand has been stimulated 
by prospects of a strike and by shortages of natural gas. (Several 
major natural gas companies in northern Ohio will be forced to 
curtail gas deliveries to industry this winter.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Executives from machine tool companies in Ohio report continued 
strong demand from manufacturers of farm equipment, cans, coal 
mining machinery, and electrical generating and nuclear power 
equipment. Order cancellations are considered at normal levels. An 
economist with a major machine tool firm in Cleveland said the high 
level of backlogs in his firm indicates increases in production well 
into 1975. They are still experiencing production bottlenecks and 
having difficulties in increasing shipments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other areas of strength include casting companies and foundries, 
which are booking orders well into 1975 and even into 1976. A major 
producer of ore and coal mining equipment in Ohio says demand has 
exploded and their backlogs have surged. Delivery time for giant 
stripping shovels runs to 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        An executive with a major truck producer said their orders recently 
have dropped to a level about equal to capacity. (Orders had been 
roughly three times the volume of shipments.) Availability of most 
supplies they purchase is generally improving, but there are still 
shortages of commodities, such as castings, forgings, and some steel 
mill products that are delaying shipments of their trucks. The firm 
said there is still a need to build in-process inventories because 
of shortages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other firms have excessive stocks and say they are working toward 
bringing inventories back to normal. For example, one of the 
District's major tire producers reports it will take about three 
months of production cutbacks to bring excessive inventories to 
desired levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contacts with several District firms indicate that recent events 
have not caused most manufacturers to alter their spending programs 
for 1975. Some firms acknowledge that spending plans are coming 
under increasing scrutiny and could be scaled down in the event of a 
deep recession. A major retail food chain headquartered in the 
District is cutting back significantly its capital spending plans 
for 1975. Within the past two weeks, another electric utility in the 
District announced it will cut its capital spending next year 
because the demand for electricity does not appear likely to grow as 
fast as previously expected. A large Cleveland-based consumer goods, 
automotive supplier, and electronics firm also recently announced a 
10-percent cutback in spending plans for 1975.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spot checks with three local savings and loan associations—one very 
small, one medium-sized, and the largest—showed that all three 
experienced net savings inflows during October. They are still being 
extremely selective in granting mortgage loans.
