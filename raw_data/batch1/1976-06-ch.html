      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      The uptrend continues in the Seventh District. The rubber strike 
  that began April 21 has had much less impact than had been expected. 
  Retail sales appear to have softened somewhat in the past six weeks, 
  but retailers do not appear to be particularly disturbed. Inventory 
  building is proceeding cautiously. Orders for capital goods are 
  generally improved, but the picture is mixed and no pronounced 
  uptrend, overall, is anticipated until late this year. Order lead 
  times have lengthened, but significant shortages and bottlenecks are 
  not yet evident. The improvement in real estate is still confined to 
  single-family homes. Some observers are hopeful that the general 
  inflation rate can be held at 5 percent or less, but those who fear 
  an acceleration in price inflation are probably more numerous.
     </div>
     <p>
      Tire inventories at all levels proved to be much larger than almost 
  anyone had estimated. Shipping vehicles without spares has conserved 
  supplies. Also, the industry has been operating at a higher rate 
  during the strike than had been thought possible. Supervisors and 
  the clerical staff are operating most of the tire plants that are on 
  strike—in one case at 35 percent of capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the slowing in sales of general merchandise in May is 
  attributed to cool weather. Consumer attitudes are improved. They 
  are using credit freely and are paying bills more promptly. Demand 
  for appliances is not as strong as had been expected. One observer 
  now expects sales of appliances to be up 10 to 12 percent this year, 
  rather than the 15- to 20-percent gain expected earlier. Strength in 
  auto sales may be adversely affecting appliances. Orders for 
  furniture are sharply above last year, and factory backlogs are up 
  about 40 percent. The boom in sales of RV's continues, and boating 
  equipment also is very strong. Airlines traffic is up 13 percent 
  from last year's depressed period, and a gain of 10.5 percent is now 
  expected for the year—up from 8 percent forecasted earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inquiries concerning shortages and bottlenecks revealed few 
  immediate problems. Much depends on how rapidly inventories are 
  increased which could cause lead times to lengthen markedly and 
  possibly bring back double ordering. Most producers of capital goods 
  and components have increased capacity significantly since 1973. 
  Castings and forgings may become short again but only if capital 
  spending accelerates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Restrictions imposed by regulations of EPA, state and local bodies, 
  and private legal actions have hampered expansion of capacity. A 
  large share of capital spending is channeled into environmental and 
  safety facilities. Many foundries, forging operations, and coke 
  ovens have been closed down and others will be. Restrictions have 
  been placed on start-ups of oil refineries which take three to four 
  years from go-ahead to completion and electric utility plants which 
  have even longer lead times. Some new coke ovens, which meet 
  operating rules, are not producing efficiently. Restrictions on 
  operating rates hold down output at nuclear power plants—usually 
  the lowest cost units.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel may prove to be the major limiting factor on industrial 
  production again. Steel is expected to be in tight supply in the 
  fourth quarter and in 1977. Shipments from U. S. mills probably are 
  limited to 100 million tons this year and 105 to 108 million next 
  year. At present, foreign suppliers can be counted upon to 
  supplement supplies. The potential bottlenecks in steel production 
  are availability of coke and high-grade ore pellets. Various steel 
  companies slowed expansion programs during the recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oil would soon be a serious problem in case of any interruption of 
  supplies from abroad, which now account for over 40 percent of 
  domestic supplies. A 5-percent increase in OPEC prices is expected 
  by year-end. Spot shortages of gasoline are expected this summer, 
  particularly of lead-free gasoline which is highly susceptible to 
  contamination and must be produced and distributed with great care. 
  Oil refineries are operating at 89 percent of capacity, currently, 
  and 92 percent (by this measure) is considered to be the practical 
  maximum.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most industries interviewed thought that capacity is adequate except 
  for special developments such as long strikes. Nevertheless, 
  purchasing managers are continually checking primary and secondary 
  sources as to future availability. Most observers believe that 
  price/wage controls were a major factor causing the shortage in 
  1973-1974 and would be again if reinstated.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tightness in supplies develop from time to time in such industries 
  as paper and wood products when Canadian supplies are interrupted by 
  strikes. Lumber prices, for example, spurted recently. Other 
  problems develop when older, higher-cost facilities are reactivated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The trucking industry is estimated to be operating at 91 percent of 
  capacity and is expected to be at 95 percent by year-end. Retail 
  sales of heavy trucks improved recently and are expected to go much 
  higher. Orders for major truck components are up sharply, and a 
  producer of diesel engines is operating at virtual capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Orders for bearings, controls, electric motors, and other components 
  have increased significantly, partly to restock dealers. Demand for 
  replacement is also higher. None of these industries have immediate 
  capacity problems and do not expect any for this year. Sales of farm 
  equipment are excellent But not so ebullient as two or three years 
  ago. Small construction equipment sales are up, but large 
  earthmoving equipment remains depressed. Operating rates of most 
  machine-tool producers are well below capacity.
