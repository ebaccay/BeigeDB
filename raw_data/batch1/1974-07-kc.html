       Tourism has started the summer somewhat weaker than last year. Farm 
prices have turned up after declining for several months, and a good 
wheat harvest is in progress. Although cattle prices have improved, 
producers still face a rocky road in the period ahead. Production by 
manufacturers still is limited primarily by the availability of 
materials, which remain scarce and are increasingly expensive. 
Deposits and loans at Tenth District commercial banks increased less 
than seasonally during June. Most bankers do not want Regulation Q 
rate ceilings removed at this time, although they would favor 
removal as a long-run objective.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tourist season has started slowly in western Tenth District 
states this summer. State travel commissioners in Colorado, New 
Mexico, and Wyoming report fewer out-of-state visitors this June 
than last. Traffic and spending are down at small motels and other 
tourist-related businesses near several popular vacation areas. 
While some tourist spots and certain businesses may be doing better 
than last year, the tourist industry as a whole needs a strong July 
and August to finish even with the summer of 1973, much less 
approach the 1972 peak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farm prices have generally strengthened following four months of 
steady declines. Compared to a year ago, the farm-price index was 
off 4 percent as of June 15, marking the first time in three years 
that this measure had fallen below year-earlier levels. The recent 
turnaround has been broadly based with price increases occurring in 
both the livestock and crop sectors. Contributing to the run up in 
grain prices have been growing concerns over weather problems in the 
cornbelt and a smaller-than-expected winter wheat crop. The rise in 
livestock prices apparently has been triggered by a decline in beef 
and pork slaughter which, in the case of hogs, has been significant. 
Nevertheless, most cattle feeders still face serious financial 
problems because of current losses and uncertainty about the future, 
despite recent price improvements. On this note, the emergency 
credit bill before Congress has elicited a mixed response within the 
cattle industry. While some groups obviously favor the bill, several 
feeder associations have taken a neutral position. Finally, the 
wheat harvest in the District is winding down as nearly ideal 
weather conditions have permitted rapid progress in most areas. 
However, the crop—while good by most standards—is apparently falling 
below anticipated levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing managers throughout the District continue to complain of 
tight supplies and rising prices. A few feel the worst is over, as 
indicated in the national survey, but most see no let up in the 
months ahead. "We've got nothing but problems, problems, problems," 
said one agent. Two respondents said that their firms' expansion 
plans were canceled because of materials shortages. Two others 
reported going to the black market to get around allocations. But a 
buyer for a major tire manufacturer feels that some raw materials 
are more easily obtainable, at much higher prices, since controls 
were lifted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major producers of agricultural supplies report good business, but 
they, too, are held back by shortages. Agricultural industries enjoy 
some priority for certain raw materials, but their businesses still 
are limited by available supplies. Although strong, demand is 
somewhat weaker than last year because of lower farm income. In 
particular, the market for products for the cattle business has 
dried up in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total deposits at District weekly reporting banks increased less 
than seasonally during June, as a slight decline in time deposits 
was more than offset by an increase in demand deposits. None of the 
banks contacted noted a significant difficulty in issuing large 
CD's, although several did report that national corporations were 
limiting their CD acquisitions at regional banks to specified 
percentages of a bank's capital. All agreed that the recent ability 
of Federal savings and loans to issue negotiable CD's has had little 
direct effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       While banks felt that loan demand was still very strong, total loans 
increased substantially less than seasonally during June. The 
strongest demands were noted for commercial and industrial loans and 
for installment loans. The strength in business loans was primarily 
to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and oil and gas 
exploration or refining facilities. Agricultural credit demands were 
mixed, reflecting the reduced number of cattle on feed and the sharp 
increase in the credit needs of grain firms. The demand for real 
estate credit was generally weak throughout the District. About half 
the banks noted that loan delinquencies had risen over the last 
three quarters, but all agreed the level was low and several 
reported delinquencies were now declining.
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the capital note offerings of two New York banks aimed at 
consumers, reporters were asked about the desirability of lifting or 
removing Regulation Q interest rate ceilings. While most felt these 
ceilings should be removed over the long run, a strong majority felt 
this was not an appropriate time to make any significant change. 
However, the survey did turn up two interesting developments. One 
bank reported that it had recently initiated an arrangement under 
which individuals purchasing small CD's would receive maximum 
interest rates and also have an additional 1 per cent donated to the 
charity of their choice. Another indicated that a national insurance 
company was considering pooling the funds of small savers, and for a 
small fee, would invest these in large CD's.
