      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The most recent reports from District businessmen and directors 
  contain a mixture of pluses and minuses. On the plus side, tourist 
  traffic remains brisk in Florida and District manufacturers have 
  recalled some workers. Although residential construction activity 
  remains at low levels, there is some spotty evidence that the large 
  unsold housing inventories are beginning to sell. Oil exploration 
  and mining activity also are adding strength to the District 
  economy. On the minus side, retailers are reporting continued 
  weakness, especially in home appliances and furniture. Inventories 
  in many lines still remain above desired levels. Delays and 
  cancellations in capital spending plans are still being reported. 
  There is evidence that the previously heavy steel demand may be 
  slackening off, with layoffs on the horizon.
     </p>
     <p>
      The most pleasant surprise has been tourist traffic in Florida; it 
  has been a lifesaver for that state's economy. South Florida's 
  tourist trade has remained at high levels after the Christmas rush. 
  No rental cars were available in Miami for a two-week period, and 
  the hotels are sold out. However, tourists are apparently staying 
  for shorter periods than in the past and are spending more 
  carefully. One cruise ship line reports that business is so good 
  that they are turning away people. They are not sure whether it is 
  bad weather in the North or people taking a last fling that is 
  responsible. However, the cruise ship business does not appear to be 
  booming across the board. The Carnival Cruise Lines have mothballed 
  the "Bahama Star" because of low bookings and increased costs, 
  particularly for fuel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports continue to indicate that mortgage money is becoming more 
  available. A New Orleans director indicates that mortgage rates 
  there are currently at 8.75 percent; he envisions rates going below 
  8 percent by April. A large, regional life insurance company reports 
  that the sharp decline in short-term interest rates is causing them 
  to consider putting some of their new money into the housing area. 
  As yet, this greater availability of mortgage financing has not 
  translated into a noticeable pickup in sales. A New Orleans 
  businessman reports that, while more people are looking for houses, 
  the discretionary home buyer is still not in the market. New Orleans 
  resisted the condominium market and, hence, has no "Condo" problem. 
  A speculative builder in the Jacksonville, Florida area has reduced 
  prices by as much as $15,000 but is still having trouble selling new 
  houses. Florida still has 60,000 to 70,000 unsold condominiums, but 
  they appear to be starting to sell because of the greater 
  availability of permanent financing. Apparently, the high-priced 
  condos are still not selling, however. Anticipations of lower 
  interest rates and prices were also reported as deterrents to sales. 
  Nevertheless, house sales in South Dade County (Miami) have picked 
  up in the past two months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Gulf Coast area is booming from oil exploration. This industry 
  is one of the few still experiencing shortages. A lack of skilled 
  labor and materials has slowed activity. They are begging for 
  welders. Steel pipe and pumps are still in short supply and delivery 
  time remains long. Construction is under way on an oil refinery in 
  the New Orleans area. A company representative reports that anything 
  of sophisticated fabrication is hard to obtain, and there is no 
  fixed price on this type of equipment. The largest strip-mining 
  operation in Tennessee is expected to spend $10 million in new 
  equipment on new coal fields.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sales and inventory picture remains mixed in the District. It 
  would appear that most retailers are still experiencing slow sales 
  and high inventories. Only auto dealers, as reported last month, 
  have made much progress in reducing inventories. The home appliance 
  business has been particularly weak. One South Florida retailer 
  indicates that inventories are heavy at both the manufacturing and 
  the retail levels. Manufacturers are just beginning to make some 
  selective price reductions. He notes that his credit business had 
  doubled from 30 percent to 70 percent of total sales. He expects 
  that this large portion of credit sales will cause problems in 
  coming months. A large department store representative reports that 
  apparel sales are now doing well but that appliances are not 
  selling. The consumer is buying either the very deluxe or the most
  economical appliances; he has gotten away from the intermediate 
  market, where inventories are heaviest. Furniture manufacturers have 
  tremendous inventory overhangs and are now taking losses to move 
  their goods. Reflecting these depressed sales and high inventories, 
  plant closings and layoffs continue by textile, apparel, appliance, 
  and furniture manufacturers. Paper and lumber mills are still 
  operating at low levels; many remain closed.
     </p>
     <p>
      An area of growing weakness is capital spending, where new reports 
  of delays and cancellations of previously announced projects have 
  been received. Plans for a large $100 million chemical plant for the 
  Mobile, Alabama, area have been suspended until market conditions 
  improve. Dupont will delay construction of a $125 million plant in 
  Mississippi until business in the paint, paper, and textile 
  industries picks up. The huge Tenneco-Westinghouse project to build 
  floating nuclear power plants near Jacksonville, Florida, received 
  an additional jolt. First, Tenneco pulled out of the project; then 
  the New Jersey Electric Company, the only customer for four plants, 
  asked for a five-year delay. Westinghouse has laid off workers and 
  is now just hanging on, with its future uncertain.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recession is apparently beginning to hit the steel industry; 
  foreign steel is now cheaper than United States steel. One 
  businessman indicated that he is now getting promises of steel 
  deliveries in three months rather than the eighteen-month period 
  needed only a short time ago when manufacturers were building up 
  inventories. He indicated that multiple orders will soon be 
  canceled, which will reduce steel order backlogs.
