      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <strong>
       August 9, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The vigor in the economic recovery reflected nationally in the most 
recent GNP figures appears to be mirrored in the sales reports of a 
number of Tenth District manufacturing firms as well as in comments 
elicited from bank directors. Increased sales were reported quite 
generally, and although little evidence of stockpiling is evident, 
inventory spending is keeping pace with recent sales improvements. 
Some firms reported longer delivery times to their customers, and 
there were scattered reports of lengthening lead times for inventory 
purchases from their suppliers. Despite sales increases, however, 
few of the firms contacted have added net to their work forces, and, 
as a consequence, there were a number of firms which reported 
noticeable productivity gains. Tenth District farm income rose more 
sharply than for the nation as a whole in the first six months of 
1972, and income prospects for all of 1972 appear to be quite strong 
vis-a-vis last year. Strong loan demand continues at Tenth District 
banks, and, with few exceptions, District banks have experienced 
large increases in total deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
       A near-consensus emerged as to improved business sales among those 
manufacturing firms and directors queried. Comments such as "best 
year on record," "up substantially," and, "business sales are beyond 
targets," characterized the kinds of responses received. Although 
several firms indicated that delivery times to their customers had 
lengthened as sales continued to improve, it was interesting to note 
that most respondents felt that they were maintaining their normal 
delivery times. In a few cases, firms cited improved delivery times 
over last year, even in the face of increased sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       The inventory picture presented somewhat of a paradox. Most firms 
continue to pursue relatively conservative inventory investment 
behavior.  Few outright attempts at stockpiling were reported; 
rather, inventory outlays were geared to keeping pace with the 
current sales picture. Although firms generally reported that stocks 
were readily available, some lengthening in the lead time from their 
suppliers was noted, particularly for such items as heavy equipment 
for handling materials. Presumably when lead times become further 
extended, and as business sales' strength gathers added momentum—an expectation held by most respondents—inventory spending may 
become more expansive. For the time being, however, those pressures 
have not yet become sufficiently persuasive to cause District firms 
to abandon their cautious inventory approach.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "close-to-the-vest" inventory behavior of Tenth District firms 
extends to hiring behavior as well. Despite the sales increases 
reported, few firms have added net to their work forces. Apparently, 
this has not had any appreciable effect on their ability to 
accommodate their customers, although a sizeable minority of firms 
reported an increase in scheduled delivery times to their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       One respondent indicated that they had actually managed to reduce 
delivery times over last year. With business improving and new 
hiring being held down, it was not surprising that a number of firms 
reported noticeable gains in productivity. In one case, it was 
reported that productivity gains were responsible for an actual 
decline in product cost this year versus last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first six months of the year, U.S. farm income was up 
approximately 10 percent over the comparable year's-earlier period. 
However, District cash receipts from farm marketings registered a 
much sharper gain than the national average because of the 
preponderance of the livestock sector and very favorable prices. 
With livestock sales—principally cattle—accounting for about 80 
percent of the total, District farm income for the first half was an 
estimated 16 percent above the comparable 1971 level. In view of the 
likely continuation of strong livestock prices, as well as the 
recent spurt in wheat prices resulting from the new trade agreement 
with Russia, District farm income for the year is expected to show a 
sharp gain over last year since the volume of farm marketings will 
also be higher than in 1971.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District bankers report continued strong loan demand in recent 
weeks. Business loan demand, which gained strength in June, 
continued to increase during July. Most of the increased demand is 
from local and regional businesses, as national accounts are still 
not utilizing their lines of credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nature of the borrowing needs range broadly from working capital 
to plant expansion. Real estate and consumer installment lending 
also continue to be sources of strength, but signs of a leveling off 
of the recent upward trend in these categories are appearing. Much 
of the real estate lending has been for commercial purposes and for 
multifamily dwellings. Auto loans have been a major component in 
installment lending. Some banks are experiencing especially heavy 
demands for agricultural loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       With few exceptions, District banks have experienced large increases 
in total deposits. Although the distribution of the deposit inflow 
between time and demand varies from bank to bank, most banks possess 
adequate funds to meet loan request. Continuing a recent 
development, Tenth District banks have not aggressively pursued 
large CD money.
