      <p>
       Reports from the twelve Districts indicate that economic activity 
continues to strengthen and the outlook of most businessmen and 
bankers is optimistic. Consumer spending, especially for tourism, 
recreational vehicles, and autos, appears to be a major source of 
strength. Capital spending and plans for future outlays still appear 
to be gathering momentum, and orders and shipments of heavy capital 
goods producers are reported to be on the upswing. While 
construction activity is at a high level, signs of some slowdown in 
construction are becoming apparent in several Districts. Inventories 
are still being held closely in check with most manufacturing and 
trade firms reporting no change or only a modest increase in 
inventories. In general, agricultural conditions are good to 
excellent. However, heavy rains in some areas have set back crop 
conditions. Loan demand is on the increase, but banks apparently 
have adequate funds to meet the expected near-term loan demand. 
Interest rates on most loans are reported to be little changed or 
slightly higher in the last month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Optimism on the part of businessmen and bankers is evident in most 
of the District reports this month. Atlanta notes that descriptions 
of the economy generally run from good to booming. Richmond reports 
that their directors are optimistic, and Kansas City notes that 
businessmen seem "unguardedly optimistic" about the economic 
outlook. And the consensus at Chicago's annual Business Outlook 
Conference was that the current economic expansion would last at 
least through the first half of 1973. New York directors were 
characterized as mixed on the economic outlook but were more 
optimistic than in the previous month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strength in the demand for consumer goods was noted in most regions. 
Minneapolis reports yearly sales gains of 5 to 10 percent in the 
Twin Cities area in the second quarter and a strong demand for meat 
at the retail level. Retail firms in New York were more optimistic 
this month about consumer confidence and outlays; consumer spending 
on nondurables appeared to be good in the Boston District. Brisk 
auto sales were cited by Richmond, Dallas, and San Francisco while 
Chicago reported an optimistic forecast for autos in both 1972 and 
1973 at their Business Outlook Conference. Cleveland, however, 
reported that car sales in that District had risen less than in the 
nation. And St. Louis noted a decline in retail sales at major 
department stores in June, following a strong uptrend earlier in the 
year. Although the recent heavy rains depressed retail sales in the 
Philadelphia District, retail executives there are optimistic about 
sales this fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Improved consumer demand is also indicated by increased spending for 
recreational activities. The Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco 
Districts all report booming sales of recreational type vehicles. 
Atlanta reports heavy attendance at Florida's Disney World, with the 
benefits of this visitor attraction apparently spilling over to 
other parts of the Southeast. Businesses catering to vacationers in 
the Kansas City District were doing very well although tourists were 
reported to be avoiding luxury items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plans for increased capital spending were noted by St. Louis and 
Chicago as a source of further economic strength. And announcements 
of new plants and plant expansions continue to be numerous in the 
Atlanta District. However, the percentage of firms reporting 
increased capital spending plans in Philadelphia's regular survey 
has stabilized at about 45 percent in the past two months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upturn in capital spending this year is beginning to have a 
noticeable impact on the sales of some heavy goods manufacturers. 
Chicago cited increased sales of heavy construction equipment and 
over-the-road trailers while Boston reported an increase in orders 
for oil field equipment and aircraft parts. Steel companies in the 
Cleveland District are experiencing a strong and steady order pace 
with the prospect of some pickup in orders from the auto industry 
for August deliveries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventory levels are generally unchanged or only increasing 
moderately. Manufacturing respondents to the monthly Richmond survey 
reported little change in their inventories and judged their 
inventory levels to be about right. San Francisco reported no sign 
of major inventory building at the retail level in that District, 
and Richmond noticed no change in trade inventories. New York and 
Boston, however, saw some evidence of moderate inventory building at 
the retail level. The Minneapolis Bank directors cited high finance 
costs, better management, and better-than-expected sales as possible 
reasons why inventory-to-sales ratios were remaining relatively low.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crop conditions are generally good to excellent in the St. Louis, 
Chicago, Kansas City, and San Francisco Districts. However, cool 
weather and excessive rainfall have hurt crops in the Richmond 
District, and New York and Philadelphia report some crop damage due 
to flood conditions. Rain also slowed the Kansas wheat harvest, but 
the 1972 crop may still rank among the largest on record. Prices for 
both crops and livestock are reported to be favorable for increasing 
farm income this year, especially in view of generally high levels 
of production.
      </p>
      <p>
       While employment gains were reported in some Districts, the uptrend 
is apparently still rather slow. Some manufacturers in the Richmond 
and Philadelphia Districts expect to increase their employment and 
lengthen workweeks. Nonfarm payroll employment is expanding 
moderately in the Cleveland District, and the insured unemployment 
rate has turned down. The unemployment rate for the five 
southwestern states in the Dallas District is at a low 4.4 percent, 
but employment analysts there are not optimistic about gains in 
employment during the rest of 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       The demand for all types of loans is apparently strong in nearly 
every District and advancing at a steady pace. Cleveland did note, 
however, that business loan demand over the June tax date was less 
than a year ago in their District. The supply of loanable funds at 
banks is adequate, but in the Chicago District the volume of 
outstanding CD's has been rising. While interest rates are 
apparently little changed, St. Louis and San Francisco noted a 
slight rise in rates.
