      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The attitudes of the New England directors are hopeful; they 
  anticipate a recovery of activity presently. However, it is stressed 
  that much improvement is required before the economy will perform 
  acceptably. In view of recent years' experience, businessmen are 
  attempting to gauge likely policy in 1976 and 1977 before framing 
  current investment strategies. Unemployment in New England rose to 
  11.1 percent in March; for the previous month the rate was 10.4 
  percent, and a year before it was 6.5 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings bankers are in no hurry to cut mortgage rates despite record 
  deposit growth. They suspect the money is merely "parked" since the 
  gains have been most heavy in passbook and NOW accounts. Loan 
  officers expect rising interest rates during the fall. Similarly, 
  commercial bankers are expecting interest rates to rise later in the 
  year; any cuts in loan rates will be modest and short-lived. 
  Applications for business loans are strengthening and bankers are 
  endeavoring to acquire direct consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales are still sluggish despite the continuation of 
  aggressive promotions. Retailers have managed a considerable amount 
  of inventory liquidation and are looking to the tax cut as a source 
  of hope. However, a director reports that his strategy is unchanged: 
  remain liquid, plan modestly, and be ready to move aggressively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businessmen dealing in capital goods markets are noticing a 
  continuation of weaker orders. Delays of delivery time are still 
  occurring. However, directors claim they are becoming more 
  optimistic. In some instances, they cite September or October for 
  bringing significant improvements in production. More generally, 
  they believe that if the bottom has not been attained, it is at 
  hand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Real estate development has been under a squeeze in Boston. A 
  director reports that city residential rehabilitation projects are 
  endangered since operating costs are overtaking expected revenue at 
  a rapid pace. Even middle- and upper-class residential areas are 
  developing tenants' unions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The high rates of unemployment have caused some social problems. 
  Young entrants to the labor force and college graduates are not 
  being placed in jobs. A director closely involved sees substantial 
  changes in the attitudes of such people. Furthermore, the middle 
  class has begun joining the food stamp program in numbers, which the 
  director considers significant.
     </p>
     <p>
      Announced layoffs and furloughs have moderated considerably in 
  recent weeks. Consequently, it is expected that New England 
  unemployment rates may increase, but it is anticipated that the top 
  is near.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Tobin, Eckstein, Samuelson, and Solow were available for 
  comment. None of them believe that a recovery is "in the bag"as yet. 
  They also concur that monetary policy should take a stimulative 
  attitude until the economy is definitely regaining health.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin does not feel the economy is resting on a knife edge of 
  depression and inflation. He would like to see a dramatically lower 
  federal funds rate coupled with money growth of 10 percent for a few 
  months. He fears that though things look rather hopeful on first 
  blush, the economy has no holding power—the financial condition of 
  business especially is unfavorable and we risk stagnation if the 
  rebound is not nurtured. He sees nonmonetary forces fueling a 6 
  percent inflation rate should 4 percent growth be attained; 7.5 
  percent money growth would risk another slump. We need not lock the 
  throttle at higher rates of money expansion; we need to assist the 
  recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein notes that the economy is still fundamentally weak, and his 
  forecasts are "a gamble that the tax cut will work" and that 
  monetary policy is stimulative. He is sympathetic with the use of 
  the federal funds rate as a target and he is relieved to see that it 
  has eased somewhat. He notes that a 5 percent funds rate accompanies 
  8.3 percent money growth in his model—this is close enough to 7.5 
  percent to be well within our margins of forecasting and control 
  errors. Five percent money growth would produce a depression and 
  would be plausible only if inflation falls to the 1 to 2 percent 
  level.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson senses that the trough is near. He sees no rebound in 
  housing or autos for some time, but it is a good bet that growth 
  will exceed 4 to 5 percent by year-end. He feels that average money 
  growth would be better near 7.5 percent, rather than 5 percent. 
  Transient needs require faster growth until the recovery is 
  definitely under way. We are still half a business cycle away from 
  acceptable performance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow believes the turn is near and he believes that monetary ease 
  should be maintained. In terms of the funds rate, he feels that 5 to 
  5.25 percent is appropriate at least until the summer. In his 
  opinion, fears that high real growth at this time will fuel 
  inflation are "rational but wrong." Prices depend on the general 
  level of activity, and the economy is very slack. Excessive growth 
  is not likely and monetary policy should be prepared to assist 
  capital investment during the recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      All agree that the tax cut is not excessive, therefore there is no 
  reason to believe that investment need be crowded out by higher 
  consumption outlays. There is room for investment expansion, and 
  monetary policy need not inhibit it.
