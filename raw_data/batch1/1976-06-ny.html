      Beige Book Report: New York

      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>

      Overall capacity constraints are not expected to materialize this 
  year or early next year, according to Second District business 
  leaders, directors, and industrial analysts. Current production 
  rates are below most industries' capabilities, and the few shortages 
  that exist appear limited to isolated product lines. Respondents 
  appear less sanguine about the longer-run outlook, however. One 
  after another, they complained of the disincentives to investment 
  caused by environmental and safety legislation. Consequently, little 
  outright addition to capacity is foreseen, and many observers are 
  apprehensive over bottlenecks and shortages emerging toward the 
  close of 1977.
      <div>
      </div>
      <p>
       While on the whole, substantial plant capacity remains to meet 
    increased production, high utilization rates in some industries—notably paper, steel, and textiles—suggest that some capacity 
    problems could develop within the coming year. A senior official of 
    a trade association expected full capacity utilization in the paper 
    industry to be reached by mid-1977. In this official's view, high 
    utilization rates were already building inflationary pressures. The 
    chief economist of a major paper producer felt certain lines, 
    especially newsprint, were already at capacity but expected 
    production to stabilize as inventory building subsided. One director 
    felt there were clear indications of possible steel shortages, 
    largely owing to tightness in foundry capacity. An industry analyst 
    of a leading securities firm, however, discounted the current 
    evidence. He emphasized that while production was tight for steel 
    products associated with automobiles, substantial slack existed 
    elsewhere. He argued that since auto production is unlikely to 
    accelerate, steel capacity should remain adequate. Textile industry 
    respondents generally felt that capacity utilization, while high, 
    would not reach its upper limit in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the wake of the severe bottlenecks created by shortages a few 
    years ago, everyone surveyed appeared to be sensitized to signs of 
    developing shortages. On the whole, business leaders and industrial 
    economists reported that raw materials are currently plentiful, and 
    they generally did not anticipate near-term shortages. The few 
    exceptions cited—some chemicals, such as chlorine and possibly 
    cotton fibers—were not viewed as likely to create significant 
    bottlenecks. The Buffalo Branch directors generally discounted the 
    risk of a reemergence of shortages of industrial materials in the 
    foreseeable future. In their view, the lengthening of lead times for 
    steel and for certain chemical and paper products was attributable 
    to an unwillingness on the part of firms in those industries to 
    activate marginal facilities and to rehire marginally productive 
    workers until the upward trend of orders became more pronounced.
      </p>
      <p>
       An official of a major auto manufacturer and other observers felt 
    that, barring an exceptionally long walkout, the rubber workers' 
    strike would not substantially impinge new car production. 
    Inventories were expected to hold through the end of July, as auto 
    manufacturers have acted to conserve their stockpiles, and tire 
    production has not been cut as drastically as originally estimated. 
    Moreover, due to the model-year changeover, auto plants will be idle 
    for two to three weeks over the summer. Thus, our respondents did 
    not expect auto production to be seriously affected before the end 
    of July. One, however, did mention the likelihood of short supplies 
    of some types of truck tires before then.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the energy front, supplies look ample, except for natural gas. 
    The chairman of a major oil firm emphasized that shortages of 
    natural gas were likely if the winter were severe. His fears were 
    echoed by a major industrial user of natural gas who recognized the 
    likelihood of service interruptions that would curtail production in 
    the winter. Natural gas prices were seen as rising rapidly. The 
    president of a major international oil firm felt that minor 
    production problems could be created because of the changing mix of 
    sour-sweet crude (high-low sulfur content crude) resulting from 
    increased imports. Spot gasoline shortages were expected by the 
    senior economist of a petroleum firm, but he felt they would be 
    temporary and localized. Over the longer term, the chairman of a 
    major coal mining firm felt price pressures in his industry would 
    intensify as a consequence of safety and environmental mandates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerns over the impact of environmental legislation on capacity 
    growth dominated the discussion of the longer-run outlook for 
    capacity utilization. Although respondents felt that real capital 
    spending would increase, they discounted the potential impact on 
    capacity, citing requirements for increased "unproductive" spending 
    on pollution abatement and safety equipment. This legislation was 
    also viewed as blunting the incentives for increasing capital 
    investment. In addition, uncertainty over constantly changing 
    environmental laws and regulations was viewed by the vice president 
    of a diversified chemical firm as hampering effective planning of 
    long-term expansion projects and raising the riskiness of 
    investments. In the textile industry, one company analyst felt that 
    additions to productive capacity would decline 5 to 10 percent in 
    the coming year. The Buffalo Branch directors stressed additional 
    influences prompting businessmen to approach plant and equipment 
    investment with caution and reluctance. In this regard, they 
    mentioned fears of a possible resurgence of inflation and lack of 
    confidence in government.
