      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 5, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       While the outlook of businessmen and bankers is still mixed, 
confidence appears to be increasing. A definite upswing in optimism 
is reported from various sections of the District, although from 
some areas we still get reports that the future pace of recovery is 
in doubt or recovery is not widely based. Reports of employment 
increases and plant announcements are becoming more numerous, 
whereas weakness continues in such important regional industries as 
textiles, aluminum, mobile homes, and phosphate production. A 
special survey of leading department stores throughout the District 
indicates that sales have been exceeding expectations and that 
respondents are more optimistic than at any time in the past year 
and one-half. Because of recent wage settlements and possible 
strikes by steel and aluminum workers and longshoremen, inflation 
fears persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plant announcements include a major urethane plant in Lake Charles; 
plants to manufacture water heaters, microwave ovens, gloves, and 
fire extinguishers in Alabama; a sewing plant in Alabama; a small 
appliance manufacturing plant in Mississippi; a household paper 
products plant in south Georgia; and a natural-gas-processing 
facility in north Florida. In addition, a Gulf Coast shipyard has 
received an order for 246 Seabee barges. A power company executive 
reports renewed interest in industrial and other projects that were 
postponed earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trucking industry which transports poultry from Alabama and 
Georgia and returns produce is reported to be expanding. For 
example, one carrier with a fleet of thirty refrigerated diesels is 
buying sixteen additional trucks and anticipates "all the business 
he can handle". In Florida, port facilities are handling record 
tonnage, and frozen orange juice shipments are running 30 percent 
above a year earlier. Also, some increase in operations is occurring 
at selected military installations; for instance, Alabama air bases 
are benefiting from the resumption of full operations at an air 
force school and the transferring of a helicopter school from Texas 
to Alabama. The Mississippi test facility is adding 250 employees 
because of tests of the space shuttle craft engines; an increase in 
sales of nylon and dacron polyester products is responsible for a 
200-man employment rise at a Chattanooga chemical plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing construction is reported strong in several areas of the 
District. A large residential development-covering 1,000 acres and 
planned for a community of 7,000-has been announced in Orlando. A 
huge complex, including office buildings, a hotel, and retail shops, 
is being planned for downtown Atlanta. The project, which will not 
be under construction for eighteen months, will eventually cost more 
than $100 million. However, construction of a domed stadium in New 
Orleans may be delayed. Stadium bonds failed to attract any bidders, 
because some groups are opposing the stadium in the courts. The 
legal .issues cannot be settled until the state legislature meets, 
and by that time market conditions may not permit the sale of these 
bonds within the 6 percent limitation.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Research Department telephone survey of department stores 
indicates that Easter sales were better than expected in New 
Orleans, Jacksonville, and Nashville. One leading store reported a 
year-to-year 15 percent gain in sales in the January through mid-
April period. Sales have been weak in Birmingham, perhaps because of 
the threat of a steel strike. The Atlanta sales picture was mixed, 
with one respondent reporting sales stronger than expected but the 
other reporting sales about as expected. The survey detected a 
noticeable increase in optimism among retailers, and most of the 
respondents thought that the consumers had "loosened up" and begun 
to spend.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are some notable exceptions to generally more prosperous 
conditions in the District. The mobile-home industry continues to be 
in a slump, although some pickup has been reported in recent weeks. 
Several mobile-home plants are reported to have closed in south 
Georgia, and one Alabama producer has filed for bankruptcy. Yet, a 
site has reportedly been purchased for a fourth mobile-home plant 
near Ocala, Florida. One banker noted that he is reluctant to lend 
to mobile-home producers, because he believes the industry is 
"shaky", and he expects a consolidation of existing firms into three 
or four major producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aluminum industry is also reported to be depressed, although 
strike-hedge buying is expected to lift production soon. Employment 
at the Cape Kennedy Space Center has been holding steady, but 
another sharp drop in employment is expected unless the center is to 
play a part in the space shuttle program. Textile manufacturing in 
Alabama is reported weak, which is evidenced by the recent closing 
of a long-time sportswear producer. Four hundred have recently been 
laid off by a maintenance firm that has a contract at an Alabama air 
base. Three hundred and fifty employees have been laid off at a 
phosphate fertilizer plant in Florida. Because of the increase in 
unemployment, a prominent Gulf Coast employer reports that he is 
able to get and keep better employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been some increase in consumer loan delinquencies, mainly 
associated with the start-up of bank credit cards.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation remains worrisome. There is growing concern that the labor 
agreement in the can manufacturing industry may be the pattern for 
upcoming steel and aluminum industry negotiations. There is also the 
possibility of a longshoreman's strike in October. Prices of homes 
in Miami have risen 100 percent in the past five years, including a 
20 percent rise from the first quarter of 1970 to the first quarter 
of 1971. TVA has hinted that there may be another increase in 
electric rates-on top of a 23 percent raise last October-when 
existing coal contracts expire and have to be replaced with new ones 
at high price levels. Another natural-gas utility has requested a 
rate increase.
