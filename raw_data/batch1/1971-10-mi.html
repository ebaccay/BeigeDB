      <p>
       With the exception of a pickup in automobile sales, Ninth District 
consumer spending has not changed noticeably since President Nixon 
announced his new economic program. Directors of this Bank, however, 
feel that retailers in their areas expect good sales in the latter 
half of the fourth quarter. Results of our latest agriculture credit 
conditions survey reveal that farm incomes have improved in recent 
months, but there is some doubt as to whether these higher income 
levels will be sustained.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank directors in general felt that the President's tax proposal 
would have a positive effect on business activity. They were 
uncertain, however, as to whether modifying the proposal to grant 
more tax relief to consumers would achieve greater fiscal stimulus. 
Most felt that the investment tax credit was necessary, and one 
director indicated that it would be particularly beneficial in the 
long run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors reported improved new car sales, and this was 
confirmed in a survey of nine regional automobile sales managers 
whose areas included Minnesota and the Dakotas. New car sales in 
August and September were up approximately 37 percent from a year 
ago in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota, and this sales 
gain occurred after the 15th of August. New car sales during the 
entire month of August only matched year-ago levels, while in 
September they surpassed 1970 sales by around 85 percent. There 
seemed to be a majority opinion that the prospect of a repeal in the 
automobile excise tax has stimulated car sales. Two of the nine 
sales managers, however, felt its effect had been minimal, while 
another felt the freeze had been more important in stimulating car 
sales than the proposed repeal of the excise tax. Also, District 
consumers are reported to have been favorably impressed by the 1972 
models.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank directors were guardedly optimistic about business activity in 
the fourth quarter. Most reported that retailers in their areas were 
looking forward to a good Christmas season. Many felt that the level 
of fourth quarter economic activity would be significantly affected 
by the public reaction to Phase II. Local conditions in certain 
areas of the District, however, will have more influence than the 
President's economic program. Areas in Montana and upper Michigan 
are still feeling the effects of strikes against two large copper 
producers, although disputes were settled in late September. One 
director, who looks for a good fourth quarter, attributes it to good 
crop conditions, rather than the President's program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's farm income situation seems to have improved further 
recently. Good harvests have swelled farmers' stocks of saleable 
commodities, and the price outlook for the District's fall crop of 
feeder calves from western ranges is generally thought to be 
excellent. According to this Bank's latest agricultural credit 
conditions survey, District farm earnings (which include cash 
receipts, the value of stored products, and items in the process of 
production) have improved noticeably since midsummer. By the end of 
September, record wheat harvests had been completed, and even though 
local prices were down due to the general abundance of wheat and the 
West Coast dock strike, the overall improvement in productivity more 
than compensated for the price losses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The overall picture of District farm income, however, obscures the 
problems of some farmers. In late summer, many of the District's 
cornfields in southern Minnesota and eastern South Dakota suffered 
crop damage due to dry weather, a problem which was compounded by 
low corn prices. Hogs, which are important in the same areas of the 
District, have also brought low prices. Unfortunately, the current 
strength in farming and ranching has not caused increased business 
activity in the industries supplying agricultural inputs. Farmers 
have again grown cautious in purchasing input items, especially 
machinery and equipment. District bankers indicated that this 
caution was partially responsible for some softness in the demand 
for intermediate-term agricultural credit. Comments received in our 
agricultural credit conditions survey revealed that recent declines 
in product prices were causing farmers to evaluate their 
possibilities for new resource commitments more critically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The survey also indicated that farm earnings for the final quarter 
of this year are not expected to be as high as they were in the 
third quarter. Crops yet to be harvested as of October 1 were in 
poorer condition because of the dry weather; and the high feeder 
cattle prices, which currently indicate high incomes for the 
District's ranchers, will subsequently be a profit-squeezing cost to 
District cattle feeders. A few survey respondents even speculated 
that District feedlot operators would not be able to bid as much for 
input cattle as operators in other areas, resulting in a decline in 
District feeding.
