      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 10, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Our directors, representing national companies, report that business 
remains good and that sales and orders are continuing to rise at a 
rapid pace in most lines. Orders for capital equipment are 
especially heavy, while orders for consumer goods are a little 
slower than last spring. The aerospace industry is now reported as 
doing very well. New England's economy is not as exuberant as the 
picture they present. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose 
in August to 6.5 percent in Boston and to 7.3 percent in all of 
Massachusetts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orders for capital equipment are reported as very vigorous. One 
director, with a division in chemicals, reports that expansion for 
chemical plants is very strong, stimulated by the fact that the 
industry has a lot of catching up to do. Another director reports 
large foreign orders for capital goods. This director has just 
returned from Poland with a large order for brass rolling mills. The 
machine tool industry has completely recovered from the depressed 
1970-71 levels and now has very high backlogs which could carry it 
through 1974 at a good pace even if no further orders were received.
      </p>
      <p>
       The aerospace industry has also recovered from its depressed state 
and is now described as doing very well, with one director reporting 
record-high backlogs for superalloys. The resurgence is based on 
domestic defense orders, commercial orders (noise and smoke 
pollution requirements, replacements for 747 engines, helicopters 
for energy exploration), and foreign orders. Heavy foreign orders 
for helicopters have created capacity problems for one major 
producer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite some supply problems, inventories are rising due to both 
work in process and an increased level of desired inventories as a 
result of continuing high sales. In most lines, our directors report 
work, but not capacity, is at high levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       A major importer of liquified natural gas (LNG) expects no fuel oil 
shortages this winter, although supply will be tight and prices are 
"really going up." This company is providing LNG to utilities in 
Boston as supplementary stand-by supplies. Despite the high price of 
LNG compared to domestic natural gas, the amount it can sell is 
limited only by its supply of tankers to transport LNG from Algeria.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four of our academic correspondents, Professors Eckstein, Tobin, 
Samuelson, and Wallich, were available for comment. Professor 
Wallich anticipates a "real but slight" recession in the second half 
of 1974. The important elements in his forecast are an inventory 
buildup and rundown, plus a profit squeeze due to the combination of 
continued controls, declining productivity, and a declining 
inventory valuation adjustment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eckstein continues to project a growth recession in which production 
gains persist, despite slackening final demand, as a result of 
inventory restocking. Eckstein expects strong credit demand next 
year because growth in corporate cash flow will be down to about 2 
percent as opposed to the 18 percent rate of growth over the last 
three years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noting a "slight but perceptible improvement in optimism," Samuelson 
concluded, "the American economy is not doing badly." The 
surprisingly swift decline in short-term interest rates, Samuelson 
felt, was primarily due to the declines in commodity prices but also 
to the economy 's slower growth since the end of the first quarter. 
Eckstein also did not attribute the recent easing to the monetary 
policy. Instead, he believed the market had previously been 
"frightened" of a credit crunch, and expectations carried short 
rates far above their fundamental equilibrium levels. Recently, the 
market discovered the Fed was not going to continue tightening 
indefinitely. According to Eckstein, the Fed "created unnecessary 
fear and worry by previous tightening and [the consequent) 
disintermediation." Wallich offered two alternative interpretations 
of the recent behavior of the financial markets. First, the 
combination of no money growth and falling interest rates may, as in 
1960, be the harbinger of a recession in early 1974. Secondly, the 
money growth figures may be an aberration due to the conversion of 
money into large CDs. With no Regulation Q ceiling on large CDs, 
Wallich feels CDs must be counted in the definition of M2. Wallich 
seemed to favor the latter interpretation which suggests policy has 
allowed rates to fall even before the economy has entered a growth 
recession.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both Eckstein and Wallich urged strongly that the Fed issue a 
statement or a speech making explicit both its intentions and the 
logic of the policy it has pursued. Amplification of the 
considerations which went into its policy would help dispel market 
uncertainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professor Tobin, noting "things have been easing," tied the 
resurgence of the stock market to interest rate declines. Partly 
because 'the stock market should not go down any more," the Fed 
should "avoid reestablishing a new higher peak in short rates." His 
policy prescription was a "gradual easing to confirm the present 
level" of short-term rates. He, along with the others, rejected an 
expansionary policy of aggressively reinforcing the recent rate 
declines. To Samuelson, the appropriate current policy target would 
be a 2 to 3 percent rate of monetary growth. While he would not yet 
go to a 4 to 5 percent target, Samuelson would tolerate further 
falls in rates if money growth came in below 2-3 percent. Eckstein 
recommended starting a gradual easing by moving the federal funds 
rate to between 10 and 10 1/2 percent within the next inter-meeting 
period. Wallich, on the other hand, would view easing now with 
alarm. To ease now would be far ahead of schedule in terms of past 
practice. Even the more severe "gradualism" of 1969-70 "failed in 
every sense" particularly with regard to its anti-inflationary 
impact. Wallich favors keeping interest rates up even if it leads to 
low growth in the money aggregates.
