      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the pervasive concern over the energy situation, 
District reports on balance point to a sustained high level of 
industrial activity as strong demand-with the exception of some 
consumer goods-generally continues in evidence. Weak spots so far by 
and large have been concentrated in regular or large-sized auto 
sales, airlines and aircraft manufacturers, residential 
construction, and, to some extent, recreational business. Largely 
reflecting developments in these sectors, some softening in the 
employment picture appears in the offing, though current industrial 
production and manufacturers orders and backlogs remain at high 
levels. However, much concern was expressed over the obstacles to 
further growth presented by the wide variety of growing shortages of 
materials in addition to petroleum products. Moreover, many 
respondents felt that the abatement of inflationary pressures was 
not in the cards for the immediate future. Increasing doldrums in 
the residential construction industry were also noted in some 
Districts, primarily as a result of high mortgage rates and the high 
cost of new housing. Strong demand and high prices were expected to 
stimulate increased agricultural production in 1974, though such an 
increase might be inhibited by fuel and fertilizer shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      District respondents generally continued to express serious concern 
over the potentially adverse effects of the anticipated energy 
shortage and the rise in oil prices. However, the main thrust of the 
"energy crisis" in terms of output and employment so far appears to 
have been concentrated on a relatively few, albeit significant, 
economic sectors, in particular, according to the District reports, 
the automobile and related industries, airlines and the aircraft 
industry, and in some areas tourism. The plastics and petrochemical 
industries have also suffered from shortages of raw materials. 
However, as noted by Boston, growing shortages of supplies other 
than petroleum products appear more critical at this time to current 
production, leading to accumulation at manufacturers of virtually 
completed products, ranging from aircraft to ovens, for want of a 
few parts. Indeed, concern over such shortages is mentioned in 
virtually all District reports. Thus, Chicago succinctly sums up the 
situation as one where so many different materials and components 
are in short supply that a list could be constructed almost at 
random, with shortages of castings, forgings, bearings, steel, 
nonferrous metals, plastics, all fuels, and paper probably being the 
most prominent. Cleveland also reports that purchasing agents in the 
Cleveland area find virtually everything they buy in short supply, 
with increasingly long delivery time, and that the steel industry 
continues to operate at full capacity despite some cutback in orders 
from the auto industry. Dallas reports a dearth of drilling rigs, 
pipes and other products involved in petroleum output, with little 
or no relief in sight over the next few years. Against this 
background, there were frequent reports of business efforts to 
stockpile, of "double ordering", and in some instances of budding 
black markets and of sharp price increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the uncertainties surrounding fuel and material supplies and 
the price situation generally, most District reports pointed to a 
continued strong business plant and equipment picture. Among others, 
business respondents in the Dallas, St. Louis, and New York 
Districts indicated they had no intention at this time of changing 
their current plans for increased capital outlays. Philadelphia 
reports that many manufacturers in that District expect to increase 
their capital expenditures in the coming months, and San Francisco 
notes that capital expenditures remain at a high level, as business 
continues to modernize or expand capacity to meet expanding demand. 
Cleveland points to strong new orders for machine tools, and to a 
high level of backlogs in that industry, while Chicago reports that 
producers of a wide variety of capital equipment indicate that the 
very strong demand for such equipment that had prevailed since early 
1973 or late 1972 continues unabated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consumer spending picture is somewhat more mixed, although with 
the exception of sales of autos-and, in some instances, of other 
durables-on balance still appears strong. In part, this strength may 
reflect anticipatory buying, which was mentioned by Cleveland and 
New York. A number of Districts, including Minneapolis, Chicago, San 
Francisco, and Richmond, report that retailers have generally 
enjoyed a high level of sales over the holiday season, in some cases 
exceeding expectations. Atlanta, however, notes that increased 
consumer cautiousness may have kept a "good" Christmas season from 
being a "great" one, while a mixed consumer spending picture emerges 
from Cleveland. A slowing down in department store sales of 
postponable items is mentioned by Philadelphia, while St. Louis also 
reports a slowdown in consumer purchases, reflecting in part a sharp 
drop in auto sales, and perhaps the unusually bad weather conditions 
in that area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding the employment situation, a number of Districts, including 
San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Louis, Chicago, Atlanta, and 
Richmond report some laying off in industries directly affected by 
the energy crisis—notably in the auto, airline, and aircraft 
industry-but otherwise in general see little evidence that this 
trend is becoming more widespread at this time. Manufacturers in the 
Kansas City District expect employment to hold up well in 1974, but 
some manufacturers in the Philadelphia District expect laying off 
workers by next summer.
