      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 12, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The economy lacks buoyancy in most parts of the Tenth District. This 
is reflected in continued sluggish business activity, although there 
is substantial variability by region and sector. This weakness, 
combined with the easing monetary policy stance, is having an impact 
on district commercial banks. With loan demand easing and more funds 
available, banks generally are emphasizing investment portfolios 
which are aimed at improved liquidity positions. They want to remain 
flexible because of uncertainties they perceive relative to future 
rate movements.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business activity in Kansas and Missouri has been most affected by 
the current economic slowdown. Employment in the aircraft industry, 
particularly in Wichita, remains soft—as corporations have 
curtailed their purchases of executive planes and Government 
contracts remain weak. In addition, Kansas City is still suffering 
from the impact of the long construction and General Motors strikes. 
Business activity in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Nebraska has not been 
affected as much by the current slowdown, largely because they have 
not experienced the severe economic misfortunes of the other areas. 
Business in Colorado is also being sustained by a strong outdoor 
recreation industry. Activity in ski areas continues to increase at 
rates that are normal or better. Mining activity is depressed. 
Domestic oil exploration is down because of various Government 
actions discouraging such activity. Economies of cities where 
uranium mining is important such as Grand Junction, Colorado, have 
been adversely affected by curtailment of Government uranium 
purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since retail sales are so important at this time of year and 
consumer spending is being closely watched as a clue to economic 
growth in 1971, district retail stores were again surveyed this 
month. Reports were mixed—with some department stores and discount 
houses reporting a decline in sales during December, as compared 
with the same month last year; while others reported gains, mostly 
of a modest nature. After having generally good sales in November, 
several stores reported that sales in early December were 
disappointing but then improved substantially again just before 
Christmas. Weather conditions may have been partly responsible for 
this pattern. Generally, stores that had the best gains were the 
large combination mail order-department stores. One regional 
controller of a chain of such stores said that their sales usually 
hold up quite well during economic slowdowns when customers are 
interested in good quality at reasonable prices. Somewhat 
surprisingly, a large store that specializes in luxury gift items 
and caters to above-average income customers reported sales this 
fall increased by about 10 per cent. Generally, stores that had 
strong sales just before Christmas also report strong post-Christmas 
sales, while stores with weak pre-Christmas sales continue to 
exhibit weak sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       The surveyed retail stores were also asked whether they had used any 
extra promotional activities such as intensified advertising 
campaigns or earlier price reductions this year due to the economic 
slowdown. Most stores that reported generally good sales in December 
said that they had not made any special promotional efforts this 
year. On the other hand, many of the stores with disappointing sales 
records said that they had undertaken special advertising—with 
stress on value—and had used more price promotion sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, auto dealers in all parts of the district indicated that 
sales of new American cars in December 1970 were lower than during 
December 1969. However, they report that sales of 1970 models 
through November were above the comparable year-earlier period. 
Shoppers are showing some interest in the subcompacts, but dealers 
say that these new domestic introductions are not especially 
popular. What success they are achieving appears to be at the cost 
of one-size-larger, American-made models. Foreign cars seem to be 
selling well everywhere. GM dealers blame slow sales on short 
supplies, while some dealers in foreign makes say they are 
continually sold out. Little showroom traffic is making many dealers 
in domestics pessimistic about sales prospects for coming weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand is continuing to ease at many Tenth District banks. 
Banks with ample investable funds are reacting to the weak loan 
demand in several ways. In addition to a continued repurchasing of 
loans from holding companies, a more aggressive loan policy appears 
to be developing in some cases. More generally, however, banks 
continue to fortify their liquidity positions. In their investment 
policy, most are cautious—placing funds in shorter-term notes and 
short-term municipals, and, in some instances, selling Federal Funds 
where, until recently, they were purchasing them. Some banks 
expressed the view that long-term interest rates are likely to come 
under renewed upward pressure in the coming months, and that loan 
demand is likely to strengthen. This partly explains the continued 
cautious approach toward liquidity.
