      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The May survey of Fifth District businesses supports the view that 
  business conditions are beginning to improve. It is not yet apparent 
  that a strong recovery has taken hold, but survey responses and 
  other reports from around the district are more encouraging than at 
  any time in recent months. Among the most encouraging signs at the 
  present time are reports of notable improvements in labor markets. 
  Several states have begun to report declines in unemployment rates 
  and increases in employment. Of the manufacturing firms responding 
  to our survey, more report an increase in the number of employees 
  than report a decrease for the first time since August 1974. 
  Shipments and new orders show little further improvement, after 
  significant improvement in the previous month. Optimism continues to 
  spread in the manufacturing sector. Recent contacts with Fifth 
  District banks indicate that loan demand in virtually all lending 
  areas continues weak and that this weakness is expected to continue 
  for at least the next three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest district survey indicates improvement in a broad range of 
  activities and a continued swing toward brighter expectations. In 
  the manufacturing sector, shipments and new orders have held firm, 
  showing perhaps a slight gain, after a relatively strong showing in 
  May. In particular, the latest reports on new orders represent a 
  substantial change from the widespread declines which occurred from 
  September 1974 through March 1975. Backlogs of orders showed some 
  further declines in May, but the relatively weak declines of April 
  and May indicate a distinct slowing of the slide that began over a 
  year ago. The inventory picture appears to be improving, but the 
  current adjustment process still has a way to go. One-third of the 
  survey respondents report declines of both materials and finished
  goods inventories, while only one-fifth indicate increases. This 
  result may be significant with regard to finished goods inventories, 
  which apparently were still growing through March of this year. 
  Despite the latest improvement, however, 50 percent of the 
  respondents still feel current inventories are excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      The employment situation also showed signs of improvement during 
  May. For the first time since August 1974, the diffusion of survey 
  responses suggests an increase in the number of employees in 
  manufacturing firms. Even more significant results are those 
  concerning the hours worked per week, as over one-third of the 
  respondents indicate increases in this area. There remains a general 
  feeling that current plant and equipment capacity is excessive, but 
  there is little indication of any desire to alter current expansion 
  plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey of retailers also suggests some general improvement in 
  overall conditions. Over 70 percent of the retailers surveyed 
  indicate an increase in sales during May, although most report that 
  sales of big-ticket items relative to total sales remain weak. 
  Inventories showed no change from the previous month, but most 
  respondents view current levels as about right.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the area of prices, the period of weakness indicated in recent 
  months seems to have ended, or at least to have been interrupted. 
  Manufacturers and retailers report paying higher prices, and only 
  the retailers report little or no change in prices received. There 
  is now general agreement as to expectations for the next six months. 
  A majority of manufacturers and retailers foresee business 
  conditions, locally and nationally, improving over that time period.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the banking sector, commercial and industrial loan volume at 
  large district banks declined steadily during May, with cyclical 
  forces overcoming the strong positive seasonal movements normally 
  expected at this time of year. Weak demand has led to especially low 
  loan volume in the textile industry as manufacturers continue to 
  reduce their inventories. One bank indicates that demand for 
  business loans is particularly weak at its city offices. Consumer 
  loan volume continues its steady decline also. Notwithstanding the 
  weak demand situation, loan refusals are high in both business and 
  consumer lending areas as portfolio quality remains a chief concern. 
  Liquidity is steadily improving as funds from strong time deposit 
  flows displace purchased money and as investments are substituted 
  for loans. Based on their recent experiences, district banks 
  generally feel that the recovery in prospect for the remainder of 
  the year is not likely to be vigorous.
     </p>
     <p>
      Time deposit inflows are strong at both banks and S&amp;Ls, even though 
  some institutions are doing little to encourage the longer maturity 
  deposits. Net federal funds purchases in the Fifth District, 
  although high by historical standards, are considerably below last 
  year's levels. CD solicitations are being concentrated in local 
  market areas due, at least partly, to the fact that large district 
  banks still must pay a small premium for funds in the national 
  market. It has been noted that short-term CD funds are plentiful but 
  that longer-term deposits (maturities greater than 120 days) are 
  difficult to attract.
     </p>
     <p>
      District cash receipts from farm marketing during the first quarter 
  were 12 percent below a year ago, but the decline was considerably 
  less than that for the nation. Farmers generally have made good 
  progress in their field work in recent weeks. Planting of most field 
  crops in the southern portions of the district is in the windup 
  stage, with earlier plantings reportedly in fair to good condition.
