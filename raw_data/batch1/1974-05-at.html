      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

       May 15, 1974
      </strong>

      <p>
       Inflation seems to be the top item of concern of most businessmen 
and directors in the District. Consumer spending is apparently 
holding up well. However, much of the increase in spending is 
related to higher prices. Record high interest rates are causing 
commercial banks' lending rates to bump up against state usury 
ceilings in some areas. Although some soft spots still exist, no new 
job layoffs of any consequence have been recorded. Tourism, 
particularly in Florida, is now beginning to improve as gasoline 
becomes more readily available. The volume of new and expanded 
plants announced during the past month was one of the largest ever 
recorded and reflects the pace of capital spending in the District. 
On the agricultural scene, bumper cotton crops are expected, 
although some crops are behind in their planting schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation is uppermost in the minds of many. An area businessman, 
who surveyed several of his associates, summed it up in typical 
fashion:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The general consensus of most businessmen interviewed during the 
last thirty days is that they expect higher prices and more and 
larger wage demands. This they expect to lead to more and continued 
inflation. Most expressed concern for the condition, of the economy 
but were apprehensive of the ability of the nation to reverse the 
trend (i.e., inflation in a short period of time)."
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales continue to expand as indicated by reports from 
Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana. However, most of these increases 
are related to higher prices. One Alabama businessman suggests that 
people are convinced that inflation will continue and, consequently, 
are purchasing now rather than paying higher prices later. The three 
largest department stores in the Birmingham area report that sales 
for the first quarter of 1974 are up by approximately 11 percent 
from the same period a year ago; but they indicate that price 
increases accounted for over one-half of these gains. Shortages of 
wool and wool-blend fabrics may raise apparel prices but depress 
overall sales. Auto sales, particularly in the mid- to-large size 
class, have apparently nearly recovered from their earlier slump, 
according to reports from around the District. Used car sales have 
also picked up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from central Alabama and mid-Louisiana indicate a 
continuation of strong loan demand. In Tennessee, rising interest 
rates have forced bank loan rates up against ceilings imposed by 
state usury laws. Alabama bankers indicate that mortgage loan 
delinquencies have increased and are now at record highs. Consumer 
installment loan delinquencies have also been on the rise in many 
parts of the District. Several automobile dealers have reportedly 
failed, and some banks are finding themselves in the car business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor market conditions appear to have stabilized. Florida's and 
Georgia's mobile home and recreation vehicle manufacturers are 
beginning to note a pickup in sales and production. Some mobile home 
manufacturers forecast a bright future for their industry for the 
next ten years because of the skyrocketing cost of residential 
construction. In South Florida, one electrical parts manufacturer is 
expecting to add substantially to his labor force in coming months. 
However, in east Tennessee, several large nationally known 
television manufacturers expect a downturn in sales and some job 
layoffs. Tourist activity is showing a strong comeback as gasoline 
supplies become more available. In central Florida, Disney World, 
Cypress Gardens, and Circus World have reported increases in 
business in the last month. These attractions, as well as areas in 
south Florida, are forecasting a good business for the summer 
months. They reason that part of the business lost earlier will come 
this summer as a bonus. On a side note, Tampa has become the first 
city to receive an NFL football franchise since the AFL-NFL merger 
several years ago. City officials feel that this will provide a 
boost for the tourist activity. In Tennessee, however, attendance at 
the great Smokey Mountain National Park remains below par.
      </p>
      <p>
       Announcements of new and expanded plants were at record levels. 
Apparently, the energy shortage has stimulated some of these 
announcements. A $3 billion nuclear power generating plant has been 
announced by the Alabama Power Company. Louisiana Power and Light 
Company announced plans for the construction of a $1.2 billion 
nuclear generating station, with initial operations scheduled for 
1982. Gulf States Utilities announced plans to build Louisiana's 
first coal-fired electric generating plant. It will cost $150 
million. Tennessee Valley Authority recently sold $100 million in 
five-year power bonds. The funds would be used for expansion of the 
TVA power system. Other new plant announcements are as follows: a 
$213 million container board mill in Mississippi; a $150 million 
cigarette manufacturing plant in Macon, Georgia; and a $96 million 
chemical plant in Mobile, Alabama. Two large plant expansions were 
also announced: a $160 million expansion of an Alabama aluminum 
manufacturer and a $100 million plant expansion of a Louisiana pulp 
and paper processing plant. Business investment in pollution control 
equipment continued to receive top priority in many instances. An 
Alabama paper company reported capital expenditures of $25 million 
in April. Of this total, $18 million is going into pollution 
control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bumper farm crops are expected in many areas of the District. In 
Tennessee, the largest cotton crop since 1954 is expected. 
Mississippi also expects a large cotton crop. Florida's sugar cane 
industry expects the second largest crop in the industry's forty-nine year old history. However, bad weather has delayed planting of 
crops in some areas of the District. One of Alabama's most prominent 
cattle dealers reports that there is a definite surplus of beef 
cattle, and the prices of live cattle are down nearly 30 percent 
from earlier highs.
