     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 11, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Observations of bank directors and officers indicate that consumer 
uncertainty in the Ninth District is still very prevalent; this 
uncertainty is being reflected in consumer spending decisions. The 
one bright spot on the horizon is the upswing in residential 
building activity, although the outlook for other construction 
sectors is mixed. The General Motors strike is having a minimal 
direct effect on Ninth District economic activity, but the Northwest 
Airlines strike is causing considerable difficulties in some areas 
of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of uncertain future economic conditions, consumers in the 
Ninth District are still watching their purse strings very closely, 
and, based on savings flows to local savings and loans and banks, 
consumers are still saving near record proportions of their incomes. 
Although retail sales in scattered eastern portions of the District 
seem to be rising above
      <br/>
      year-earlier levels, there was a general 
consensus among directors of the bank that consumer spending is 
still very weak, especially for "big ticket" items. One director 
could only describe Minnesota retail sales as being "bad;" and, 
recent reports of additional layoffs certainly have not stimulated 
consumer optimism in the twin cities. Honeywell has announced a 
layoff of 600 workers in early November, and employees expect 
further cutbacks. Univac's closing of its Federal Systems Division 
will affect 400 workers. The
      <br/>
      Dayton-Hudson Corporation, anticipating 
that consumer buying will not pick up until next year, has announced 
that it will build only three new stores next year instead of the 
six it had originally planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      The results of recent bond elections suggest that voters are as wary 
of state and local government capital spending as they are of their 
own private expenditures. A bond dealer guessed that about 50 
percent of recent bond referendums in the District have been 
defeated. He also stated that many of those that have passed were 
only successful after two or three attempts, and only after 
substantial paring of original requests. Because of voter reluctance 
to pass new issues, many boards and local government units are not 
even putting bond issues on the ballot but instead are waiting for a 
change in voters' attitudes.
     </p>
     <p>
      States and municipalities, with the exception of Montana which has a 
six percent statutory ceiling, have been able to float bond issues 
because of the easing in market interest rates, and dealers have had 
little trouble in moving their inventories. As a result, dealer 
inventories are at very low levels. A few directors commented, 
though, that some municipalities which have been authorized to float 
issues are holding back in hopes of further declines in interest 
rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction has strengthened considerably in the 
District over the past few months because of easier mortgage market 
conditions and increased emphasis on "235 Programs." Mortgage rates 
are continuing to slip in the twin cities. Some savings and loans 
will now make government insured mortgages for as low as one 
discount point, and one savings and loan is now making eight percent 
conventional mortgage loans with a 25 percent down payment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions and expectations in other construction sectors, however, 
are mixed. Nonresidential building construction generally has 
slackened and a number of contractors are running into financial 
difficulties even after reducing expenses as much as possible. For 
the most part, directors of the bank felt that construction volumes 
would be even lower than usual this winter but hesitated to guess 
what would happen next spring when the building season begins in the 
upper Midwest.
     </p>
     <p>
      A director who is active in the construction industry felt that 
District highway construction next year will probably be at about 
the same level as it was this year. He also felt that bids will turn 
out to be substantially higher than currently expected because of 
rising construction costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the most part, the General Motors strike is having only a 
limited impact on the District, and its effect is restricted 
primarily to General Motors dealers. Dealers have been selling out 
inventories but are now "getting down to showroom models." One 
director felt that the recent reduction in copper prices was 
partially due to the General Motors strike, and another mentioned 
that heavy equipment inventories are at very low levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Northwest Airlines strike is having a very noticeable effect in 
the twin cities, North Dakota, and Montana: numerous cases have been 
cited where landing and other fees have dropped significantly; firms 
servicing the airline and airline passengers have experienced 
substantial losses of income; banks have increased their loans to 
and are carrying past due loans of Northwest employees; and a number 
of Northwest Airlines employees have taken jobs at considerably less 
pay and prestige.
