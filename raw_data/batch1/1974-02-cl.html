      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

      <strong>
       February 13, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The view of about 30 economists (primarily from major industrial 
firms and commercial banks in the District) who attended the Fourth 
District Economists Roundtable meeting on February 8 shows the 
following projections for 1974: real GNP up 0.7 percent, the price 
deflator up 7 percent, and the unemployment rate averaging 5.7 
percent. Economic activity in the District has been seriously 
affected by the truckers' strike in recent weeks. Total output may 
have declined during the past month or so, and layoffs due to the 
strike rose sharply early this month. The strike has caused severe 
dislocations among many manufacturers and wholesalers and has 
affected retail trade (resulting in some scare-buying and 
aggravating tight gasoline supplies in certain areas). Residential 
construction continues to decline; both auto producers and suppliers 
to the automotive industry have cut back operations sharply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The business economists who attended the roundtable project a 1.5 
percent decline in real GNP during the first quarter, a leveling in 
the second quarter, and resumption of growth at rates of 1.3 percent 
and 3.2 percent in the third and fourth quarters, respectively. 
There was general agreement that economic recovery would occur even 
if the oil embargo is not fully lifted, although many economists 
expect some softening in the embargo by spring or summer. Economic 
recovery in the second half largely reflects a projected pickup in' 
consumer spending and a moderate turnaround in residential 
construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rate of increase in the GNP deflator is projected to slow to 5.5 
percent by the fourth quarter, while the unemployment rate is 
expected to rise throughout the year—reaching 6.0 percent by 
yearend.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business fixed investment and government spending, particularly 
transfer payments, are expected to be the major supports to the 
economy this year. Some economists, however, questioned whether the 
Federal government would be able to spend money fast enough to 
prevent a recession in the first half of 1974. Demand from the 
capital goods markets remains strong, according to economists from 
the steel and machinery industries. The backlog of a major machine 
tool producer in Cleveland has more than doubled in the past year, 
and the firm is quoting 80 weeks delivery on most types of 
equipment. Long lead times on many components have adversely 
affected the firm's ability to increase shipments. Thus far, there 
has been no letup in demand for machinery and equipment by the 
automakers or their suppliers.
      </p>
      <p>
       An auto industry economist believes the worst of the decline in new 
car sales is over, and he expects the sales rate to improve during 
the remainder of the year (with a large makeup in the fall). The 
median forecast of nine economists whose firms depend heavily on the 
auto market shows total new car sales down 1.4 million units in 
1974, with imports holding at or slightly below last year's level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel industry economists report that the auto companies have been 
slow in adjusting their orders for lower steel requirements; 
reductions in steel purchases by auto firms are expected into the 
second quarter. The cutbacks by the auto firms are having little 
impact on the overall demand for steel—an unprecedented situation. 
Steel mills are operating at capacity and are having no trouble in 
reallocating steel to other users.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truckers' strike, however, has caused serious disruption in 
shipments of finished steel products in many areas, particularly in 
Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and Cleveland. Many other firms, large and 
small, have been unable to receive materials or ship products. 
Layoffs and reduced hours have been widespread. During the first 
week of February, layoffs attributable to the truckers' strike 
amounted to an estimated 29,000 in Ohio alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the roundtable meeting, there was much concern expressed over 
current and prospective distortions stemming from inflation. A 
representative from one of the major banks in the District reported 
an increasing tendency of corporations to seek the bank's advice in 
using escalator clauses in their contracts. Several economists 
mentioned the inability of government institutions (such as the ICC 
and state utility commissions) to cope fast enough with inflation by 
granting rate increases. Among other concerns noted were potential 
dislocations in savings outlets if inflation is unchecked, and the 
possibility of a sharp increase in the cost of labor settlements 
this year and next. (A steel industry economist said that the 
provisions of the recent aluminum agreement, if applied to the steel 
industry, would result in a 35 to 40 percent increase in labor cost 
over a three-year period.) There was also concern over the worldwide 
rise in petroleum prices, with the possibility of serious strains in 
international financial markets over the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       In discussing the energy situation, the business economists 
indicated that production in their firms was not being curtailed as 
a result of fuel shortages. (Shortages of other materials and 
supplies, however, continue to be a problem.) Several said their 
plants had been able to achieve huge savings (up to 25 percent) on 
electric power and distillate fuels without affecting output. An 
economist with a major electric utility in the District said his 
firm intends to proceed with its capital spending plans for the next 
five years, even with the possibility of continued energy 
conservation measures in the years ahead. Management believes the 
investment will be a good hedge against inflation if their demand 
projections for electric power usage are on the low side.
      </p>
      <p>
       An economist with the Agricultural Department reported at the 
roundtable meeting that a tight supply situation in crops and 
livestock will persist through the first half of the year (followed 
by relief in the second half); farm prices are expected to average 
10 percent above last year, and retail prices of food at home to 
average 12 to 14 percent over last year.
