      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic recovery in the Fourth District appears to be spreading 
beyond consumer goods to include some types of capital goods. 
Consumer goods industries have improved gradually in response to 
further improvement in spending and an end to reductions in 
inventories. The coal strike is not expected to hamper recovery. 
Employment in the District has shown little improvement in recent 
months. Upward price pressures remain intense but less widespread 
than reported last month.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Financial officers and economists in the appliance, automotive, 
glass, and machinery industries reported production and orders have 
risen from winter and early spring lows. A producer of electrical 
and gas ranges reported significant increases in sales since June 
had led to a 16 percent increase in output in September and had 
boosted their operating rate to 70 percent of capacity. Another 
appliance producer noted production of small appliances had picked 
up sharply in July and August, because of relatively short supplies 
at the retail level; but sales and orders of major appliances were 
still weak. He expects only a 10 percent increase in sales of major 
appliances in 1976 because of continued weakness in housing. A 
director with a machine tool firm reported incoming orders were very 
strong in August. A major glass producer that is a chief supplier of 
the auto industry reported that orders have picked up strongly since 
the trough in January-February 1975, but that future gains will slow 
unless automotive output rises more than is projected. An economist 
with a machine tool firm stated its recovery appeared to be V-shaped. Its net orders rose 11 units in August while net orders 
declined 25-35 units a month at the trough last winter. He expects 
orders for small cutting tools to increase about 25 percent over the 
next 12 months, or typical for the first year of recovery. An 
executive with a machinery firm reported printing press orders began 
to pick up late in the second quarter after a fourth-quarter low. A 
financial officer for a truck and construction and agricultural 
machinery producer stated orders for heavy duty trucks have picked 
up rapidly each month since spring, but orders for earthmoving 
machinery and mining machinery softened in August. An economist for 
a major producer of electrical machinery reported orders this 
quarter will be above depressed second-quarter levels because of 
special export orders this quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditions in steel have changed abruptly in the past month as a 
result of customer efforts to beat the October 1 price increase. 
Economists with three major steel firms in the District report that 
September order books are full, especially for the flat rolled 
products. One producer expects hedge buying will boost September 
shipments 20-25 percent from the July low. October shipments are now 
expected to fall back to or slightly above the July level. No real 
recovery is expected until the first quarter of 1976.
      </p>
      <p>
       The wildcat coal strike caused coal production to slip 7-8 million 
tons. An economist with a major coal producer reported that many 
miners have returned to work. He expects a moderate rise in coal 
output in 1976 (up about 5 percent from 1975) and a small price hike 
in coal around year-end. In his view, the industry has ample 
capacity to accommodate a stronger rise in demand. EPA regulations 
that restrict use of high sulphur coal represent the main short-run 
problem for management.
      </p>
      <p>
       As reported last month, most of our contacts do not expect capacity 
or material shortages to hinder the early stages of recovery, except 
those industries (especially steel and chemicals) heavily dependent 
on natural gas. The wildcat coal strike will not hinder utility or 
steel operations where ample stocks of coal are reported. Contacts 
in machine tools, electrical machinery, heavy duty trucks and steel 
expect no capacity constraint for their products at least until 
early 1977 because of current low utilization. A steel firm and a 
capital goods producer are concerned that they will not generate 
enough cash flow to support long-run capital expenditure plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our Monthly Survey of District Manufacturers shows that most 
respondents experienced increases in new orders and shipments in 
August and are still liquidating inventories. For September, 
continued improvement in orders and shipments, and a slower rate of 
inventory liquidation than in recent months are anticipated. The 
proportion expecting expansion in employment and hours worked also 
rose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment and unemployment have not improved much since the trough 
in April despite improvements in several key District industries. 
Recalls have been confined largely to automotive and household 
goods. A glass producer has recalled the bulk of workers laid off 
during the recession. Scattered recalls in steel are largely 
attributable to the bulge in September order books rather than any 
fundamental improvement in market conditions. Generally, rubber, 
chemical, and capital goods have had few recalls despite reported 
rising trends in orders and output in recent months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer spending continues to climb, although real gains are 
apparently relatively small. A director in the consumer recreation 
business commented that their revenues are 11 percent above last 
year. A financial officer for a large department store stated sales 
in August were better than in previous months as well as a year 
earlier although big-ticket items remained rather weak. He noted no 
deterioration in collections. Auto sales in the District have been 
climbing gradually for the last several months, but two large 
dealers reported inventories higher than a year ago. Both reported 
customers are buying fully-equipped cars, although customers show 
more interest in the top-of-the-line smaller cars rather than 
standard size cars. A director reported his bank lengthened maturity 
on car loans to 48 months because of the high price of cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors and chief executive officers again expressed 
apprehension that current renewed cost-price pressures would inhibit 
overall economic recovery. However, our Monthly Survey of 
Manufacturers shows that the percent of respondents who expect no 
change in prices for September exceed the percent who expect further 
increases in prices. The only concrete comments on price increases 
came from an official in the rubber industry who reported higher 
costs of synthetic fibers and certain raw materials, and a container 
and glassware producer who reported that glassware prices were 
increased 5 percent in August. On the other hand, weak market 
conditions have inhibited price increases for machine tools and 
certain other types of machinery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some bankers noted continued weakness in commercial and industrial 
loans, and one expects no sizable pickup until early 1976. Another 
banker reported higher demand for credit from a paper and container 
company that plans a sizable buildup of stocks in the fourth quarter 
of 1975. A small banker commented that raising the usury rate 
ceiling in Ohio resulted in additional mortgage loans by his bank. 
Mortgage loan demand is generally reported to be strong, and a 
financial officer with one of the largest savings and loans in the 
District remarked that mortgage rates were increased again to 
discourage demand.
