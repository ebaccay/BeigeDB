      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      An economic recovery is in progress throughout most of the Sixth 
District, although the pace at which individual states are moving 
remains very uneven. Rapid growth is most evident in Tennessee, 
while Florida continues to lag behind the other states. The pattern 
of recovery in nonagricultural employment reveals the principal 
areas of strength and weakness in each state. In Florida, the depth 
of the construction industry decline is clearly reflected in retail 
sales. Sales of department stores in other states indicate a broadly 
based upturn in holiday sales. Inventories are fairly well balanced 
except for highly advertised goods or those for which raw materials 
inventories are in short supply. Two recent developments are 
contributing a much needed stimulus to construction activity in the 
Atlanta area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sixth District nonagricultural employment in October stands at 98 
percent of the November 1973 level, having recovered somewhat from 
the low point of 96.3 percent reached last June. Nonagricultural 
employment in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee has 
regained the November 1973 level. In Georgia and in Florida, where 
employment is still declining, employment lags by about 5 percent. 
Construction and manufacturing employment have been fairly stable in 
Alabama and Louisiana, with the remaining deficit from the November 
1973 level limited to less than 4 percent. In Florida and Georgia, 
the pronounced weakness in construction employment has been a major 
depressant for business activity, with declines from the base period 
level of 41 and 22 percent, respectively. The effects of these 
reductions are echoed by lower wholesale and retail trade employment 
and by fewer jobs in the financial, insurance, and real estate 
category. Employment in these two states has also weakened in the 
transportation, communication, and public utilities category. 
Manufacturing employment has fallen about 10 percent in Florida, 
Georgia, and Tennessee, mainly reflecting reductions in durable 
goods manufacturing employment. In Florida, greater stability in 
nondurable manufacturing cushioned a larger decline in durable goods 
industries. Tennessee's weakness in durable goods manufacturing has 
been largely offset by much more rapid growth in Federal Government 
employment and in services, which reflects the vigor of the tourism 
industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      The declines noted in employment in Florida have noticeably affected 
that state's retail sales. Unlike other states in the District, 
Florida has experienced a leveling of the decline rather than an 
appreciable upturn. This pattern is reflected in directors' reports 
that October auto sales remain substantially below 1974 levels and 
that yearly increases of retail sales continue to lag behind the 
rate of price increase. Limited evidence of a revival appeared in 
November auto sales in certain areas. Results of holiday season 
retail sales lack any clear pattern. Where strong sales are 
reported, they are sporadic. The bright spots in the Florida economy 
are tourism, which is strong in Central and Eastern Florida, and a 
citrus crop, which is large but not excessive in relation to the 
expected level of demand. Conditions in South Florida are less 
encouraging. The tourist business slackened in late summer, and 
retail sales have been flat. A director commented in November that 
"no recovery can gain sustainable momentum without participation of 
the construction and tourist industries, and neither appears too 
strong at the moment." Only limited improvement is reported in the 
overstocked inventory of condominiums in many areas of Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many large department stores in the Sixth District, excluding 
Florida, have experienced a marked improvement in sales since 
Thanksgiving, a telephone survey indicates. For certain stores, 
improving sales began as long ago as May, and gains from last year 
run in excess of 25 percent. A much more relaxed and confident 
consumer mood is reportedly the source of this improvement, although 
some consumers retain an attitude of uncertainty. None of the 
retailers contacted report an appreciable increase in the proportion 
of credit sales, while one stated that the ratio of credit sales has 
continued to decline. Most stores report improved sales across the 
board without noticeable weaknesses in specific types or price 
ranges of goods. However, some reports were received of improved but
still below normal sales of more expensive furniture, appliances, 
and electronic equipment. The outstanding area of strength is found 
in fashion goods. Price resistance is not a noticeable problem; 
medium- and high-priced goods are expected to show the sharpest 
sales increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some difficulty is reported in obtaining delivery of previously 
ordered merchandise, particularly for the most popular new styles in 
soft goods and for nationally advertised toys. Most retailers regard 
these shortages as a usual seasonal characteristic, although the 
decision of some apparel manufacturers to operate on a strict "cut-to-order" basis is mentioned as a source of longer lead times. A 
related factor is the increasing number of yarn varieties, which 
creates a difficult inventory problem for textile raw materials 
manufacturers in view of more volatile shifts in demand for 
particular finished goods styles. Retail inventory levels are well-balanced on the whole, although some remaining excess is reported in 
expensive furniture lines and to a lesser degree in appliances and 
other big-ticket items. Retailers expect continued gains in 1976, 
although some concern is noted regarding the depth of the post-holiday season downturn in consumer durable goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity, which has been weak in the Atlanta area, will 
receive a boost in the near future when work begins on a new rapid 
transit rail system. Two recent developments are paving the way for 
the beginning of construction. First, the Urban Mass Transit 
Administration is expected in the near future to announce the 
awarding of a $160 million grant, primarily to finance construction 
during fiscal 1976. The second development contributing to 
initiation of construction on the project is the recent settlement 
of a dispute concerning minimum wages between the public 
transportation authority and 14 building trade unions. This 
agreement has ended a seven-month postponement of construction work. 
The first phase of the system is scheduled for completion in late 
1978.
