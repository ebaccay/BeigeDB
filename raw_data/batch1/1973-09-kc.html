      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <strong>
       September 12, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       Purchasing managers at Tenth District manufacturing firms reported 
that nearly all materials are in short supply, with no easing of the 
situation in sight. Lead times are considerably longer than normal, 
and are lengthening. Prices are rising sharply and are expected to 
continue to rise. Although larger inventories are desired, firms are 
unable to increase them for several reasons. Business loan activity 
at District commercial banks has decreased, for both demand and 
supply reasons. In the agricultural sector, higher farm prices will 
maintain pressure on food prices although greater stability should 
occur in the months ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing officers and managers at a number of manufacturing firms 
in the Tenth District were interviewed with regard to their 
materials supply situation, including availability, lead times, 
prices, and inventory plans. The composite picture resulting from 
this survey was one of uncertainty and disarray. The following 
quotation from one respondent captures much of the feeling of 
disorder: "The whole raw material situation is very unstable. You 
cannot be sure that you will get the quantity you ordered, you 
cannot be sure you will get it when you want it, and you cannot be 
sure of the price you will have to pay." Nearly all materials were 
reported to be in tight supply, with some simply not available. Many
firms find themselves facing materials allocations and allotments 
from their suppliers, which in some cases are less than the desired 
amounts. Furthermore, the purchasing managers do not anticipate an 
imminent easing of the situation. The following materials were 
specifically mentioned as being in short supply: textile products, 
especially burlap; paper and paper products, including containers; 
aluminum; plastics; petroleum products for manufacturing purposes, 
including solvents; metal castings; and steel, especially so-called 
"low profit" items—with specific mention of reinforcing bars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing managers almost unanimously report that lead times are 
now considerably longer than normal on virtually all materials 
ordered, and nearly all report that lead times are continuing to 
lengthen. Among the products and materials showing lengthening lead 
times are plastics, metal castings, steel products, electronic 
components, and electric motors. One firm estimated that lead times 
now are generally about four times their normal length, very close 
to the average increase in lead times for those items specifically 
reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices of materials are reported to be rising by nearly all 
respondents—"enough that it hurts," said one. In a few instances, 
firms reported that they had been able to protect themselves by 
contracts for the rest of this year for materials such as aluminum, 
textiles, and plastics. Further significant price increases are 
almost universally expected. The majority of respondents suggest 
that it is still too early for the influence of Phase IV rules to be 
ascertained. Several commented on the importance for future price 
movements of decisions that will be made on pending requests for 
increases, with the steel industry request singled out for 
particular attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increasing voluntary accumulation of materials inventories is very 
exceptional among the Tenth District firms surveyed. Several reasons 
were given by purchasing managers: high interest rates are a 
deterrent ("money is too expensive for building inventories"); 
materials are not available or in such short supply that inventories 
cannot be greatly expanded; allocation of materials by suppliers 
prevents further stock building. Some respondents stated that they 
could not keep production at desired levels with available 
materials, and thus could not add to inventories although they 
wanted to. The only reported instances of stock building as strictly 
a price hedge were from one heavy user of copper and another of
polyethylene, both of whom expect significant price increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       A rise of 20 percent in the month ended August 15 pushed farm prices 
more than 60 percent above a year earlier and intensified the 
pressures on food prices, pressures that will continue to be felt 
for several weeks. However, there are indications that the upward 
spiral in food prices may soon start to level out. Consumer 
resistance to high retail prices has induced a lowering of live 
animal prices, especially hogs which have dropped significantly from 
their August high. Grain prices have also weakened during this 
period, reflecting new crop prospects and slightly dampened foreign 
demand. Furthermore, with the lifting of the freeze on retail beef 
prices, cattle prices may dip somewhat if a bulge in marketings 
develops over the next few weeks. However, any decline is likely to 
be temporary. On balance, food prices should tend to stabilize in 
coming months, but hoped-for declines of a significant magnitude are 
still sometime off.
      </p>
      <p>
       A decline in business loans over the last few weeks at Tenth 
District banks has been due to both tighter supply conditions and 
decreased demand. Banks in Denver and Kansas City tended to stress 
the supply side, saying they were only making loans to old 
customers, and then very selectively. Potential new customers who 
had exhausted credit lines at competing banks and were shopping 
around for additional credit sources were being turned down. In 
other District cities a distinct slackening in loan demand from 
businesses has been noted in recent weeks. Resistance to higher 
interest rates was one reason cited for this decline. Demand in some 
other loan categories (e.g., consumer loans and loans for carrying 
grain inventories) continues to be strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aggressive marketing of consumer and large CD's has offset demand 
deposit declines at District banks. Large CD maturities are being 
kept short at most banks as a decline in short rates is expected 
soon. The public's enthusiastic response to the 4-year consumer CD's 
was something of a surprise to many bankers who soon realized that 
most of this money was coming from passbook savings in their own 
banks.
