      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 13, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in the Tenth District continue to show improvement, 
with durable goods particularly strong. Impulse buying is sharply 
down, as consumers either shop for bargains or seek quality at the 
top of the line. Inventories are now reported as balanced, and 
expectations are for a moderate expansion in both inventory buying 
and retail sales. Automobile dealers also report an improvement in 
both sales and inventories. While the production of winter wheat 
appears to have met expectations for a record harvest, corn 
conditions in some areas are rapidly deteriorating due to extremely 
dry weather. Loan demand at Tenth District commercial banks 
continues to decline as the gap between commercial paper rates and 
the prime rate widens.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Retail sales in the major urban areas of the Tenth District have 
continued to improve since May. Sales managers generally report that 
they are "very pleased with the rebound in sales" and that sales are 
"better than expected". Two major department stores note, however, 
that the Kansas City area is not doing so well as other Tenth 
District locations. Durables in general and furniture in particular 
are mentioned as showing marked sales increases. All retailers 
surveyed stressed that people are shopping for price and 
concentrating on necessities. Little "impulse buying" was noted. One 
knowledgeable source stated that people seem to be buying in two 
markets. The first market is extremely responsive to sale items, 
though discounts of 20 to 30 percent are now required to draw in the 
traffic. The second market is buying top-of-the-line goods, shopping 
for quality instead of price. "There seems to be a lack of buyers in 
the middle areas", he reported. All respondents foresee a slow and 
steady increase in sales as more and more people get back to work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventories are generally reported as "balanced", "at the right 
level", and "in the best shape they've been in four or five years". 
Plans call for a modest inventory expansion by retailers for the 
rest of the year. One interesting development, however, was stressed 
by the majority of respondents. Whereas last year vendors were 
responding quickly to new inventory orders, deliveries are now 
lagging. Two respondents expressed concern that some shortages may 
develop, that they could not respond to a rapid increase in sales, 
and that the situation might not correct itself by the holiday 
season, leading to a below-potential sales volume.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District automobile dealers all reported either "greatly 
improved" or "steadily improved" car sales in May, June, and July. 
While each dealer stressed a "bread and butter" or "hot" selling 
model, there was no general agreement on the size or type of car 
which was doing especially badly. Sales expectations for the 
remainder of the calendar year were basically for a steady increase 
in line with a slow economic recovery. Most auto dealers reported 
balanced inventories, though some added that they had plenty of cars 
to sell, while others stressed a shortage of their "hot" selling 
models. A major observation was that consumers now seem to be 
resigned to higher fuel prices. Uncertainty appears to be 
disappearing and is being replaced by cynicism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Production of winter wheat in the Tenth District appears to have met 
earlier expectations for a record crop, but a larger than normal 
proportion of yellow kernels has decreased the export value of this 
year's crop. The wheat marketing year has gotten off to a slow 
start, as farmers seem determined to hold their wheat until the 
local price reaches $3.50 to $4.00 per bushel. In general, wheat 
farmers appear to be in a financial position that will allow them to 
delay marketing this year. Corn conditions in western Missouri, 
eastern Kansas, and eastern Nebraska are deteriorating rapidly due 
to extremely dry weather. Corn conditions throughout the remainder 
of the District are about normal, but some areas have reported 
insect problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The smallest number of cattle on feed for any July 1 since 1967 was 
just reported by the United States Department of Agriculture. 
Placements continue to exceed year-earlier levels, however and, if 
this trend continues as expected, the number of cattle on feed 
should about equal year-earlier levels by the end of 1975. The 
midyear cattle inventory showed a 1 percent increase in cattle and 
calves on farms since July 1, 1974. This is a smaller than expected 
increase, and is good news for cattlemen since it now seems possible 
that the buildup in cattle numbers may be halted by the end of this 
year. Additional good news for farmers came with the announcement 
that prices received rose 3 percent during the month and ended July 
15, the fourth consecutive monthly increase after sharp previous 
declines.
      </p>
      <p>
       A survey of Tenth District bankers revealed a decline in the demand 
for loans, including a slack demand for business loans, as the gap 
between commercial paper rates and the prime rate widened. These 
results were supported by data for all Tenth District reporting 
banks showing that the volume of most types of loans increased less 
than average, or fell contraseasonally, during July.
      </p>
      <p>
       The exceptions to this pattern were loans to farmers, which were 
unchanged during July on a seasonally adjusted basis, and consumer 
installment loans, which rose slightly more than seasonally during 
July. Total deposits and large negotiable certificates of deposit 
(CDs) at Tenth District reporting banks also fell more than the 
seasonal average during July. Bankers contacted in the survey 
indicated sharply differing flows of CDs, however, with some 
reporting substantial runoffs and others indicating that they had 
attracted more CDs.
