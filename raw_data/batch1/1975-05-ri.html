      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The April survey of Fifth District businesses reveals a number of 
  signs of some improvement in business conditions, particularly in 
  the manufacturing sector. Responses from manufacturing concerns 
  suggest somewhat stronger current activity and, in particular, a 
  significant improvement in expectations, with a majority of those 
  surveyed anticipating continued improvement over the next six 
  months. Manufacturers' responses suggest some recovery in shipments 
  and new orders, as well as some further decline in inventory levels. 
  The survey of district retailers reveals little change from recent 
  months other than a marked turn toward optimism on the part of 
  respondents. In the banking sector, loan demand for inventory and 
  receivables financing and capital expansion programs has not yet 
  materialized, as commercial and industrial loan volume at weekly 
  reporting banks has remained steady since the beginning of April.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest survey of manufacturers indicates improvement across a 
  broad range of activity. Only 15 percent of the respondents report a 
  decline in the level of shipments during April, and a diffusion of 
  responses reveals the first increase in this indicator in eight 
  months. Virtually the same picture shows through with regard to the 
  volume of new orders. Materials inventories apparently continued to 
  decline, and for the first time in recent months the diffusion of 
  responses suggests a decline in finished goods inventories as well. 
  Nevertheless, over half the manufacturers surveyed continue to view 
  current inventory levels as excessive and almost half hold the same 
  view with respect to current plant and equipment capacity. Perhaps a 
  further indication of actual or anticipated gains in business 
  activity is revealed by a relative firming of prices, both paid and 
  received, during April. Some reports indicate that with inventory 
  levels becoming more manageable, firms are beginning to review 
  current price lists. The most dramatic result of the latest survey 
  concerns the outlook for the next six months; fewer than 1 percent 
  of the manufacturing respondents expect further worsening of 
  conditions, locally or nationally, over that period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers responding to our April survey gave little indication of 
  any change during the month. Total sales were essentially flat, 
  while sales of big ticket items relative to total sales remained 
  weak. Inventories showed no change, and current levels remain above 
  desired levels. As in most recent months, responses continue to 
  suggest a mild tendency toward higher prices. Further, each of the 
  respondents is satisfied with the current number and size of 
  outlets. As was the case with manufacturers, expectations showed a 
  dramatic improvement during the month. No retailer responding 
  foresees any worsening of conditions over the next six months, and 
  each expects improvement in his market area as well as in his 
  individual firm.
     </p>
     <p>
      But in general, business remains slow and there is little firm 
  evidence that any significant recovery has begun. Nonetheless, 
  improvements in various indicators are contributing to a growing 
  mood of optimism. With inventory levels becoming manageable, some 
  firms are apparently preparing to resume production at more nearly 
  normal levels. Unemployment seems to have stabilized and in some 
  cases to have declined as plants have recalled laid-off workers. 
  Significant improvement in this area may be some time in coming, 
  however. Despite the growing optimism, caution pervades some 
  industries and substantial adjustments may be yet to come as 
  marginal operations are eliminated and plans are revised to meet new 
  market conditions. Industries such as textiles, which have been 
  especially hard hit, are poised for the recovery, and a good showing 
  in housing construction could lead to a swift return to relatively 
  high levels of production.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any improvement that may have occurred in Fifth District businesses 
  has not yet been strong enough to show up in increased demand for 
  bank credit. Bank loan customers in some important Fifth District 
  industries, however, have indicated to reporting banks that their 
  business situations are improving. The demand for residential 
  mortgages at district banks and S&amp;Ls is substantially below the 
  level normally experienced at this time of year. S&amp;Ls in some areas 
  have responded to improved liquidity by becoming quite aggressive in 
  the mortgage market, and as a result are doing more business than 
  most banks. The tax credit on new home purchases may have stimulated 
  some interest in home buying, but most lenders feel it has had only 
  a limited impact on market conditions. It is seen as having limited
  effect because (1) few homes qualify, (2) builders and consumers are 
  confused by its complexity, and (3) existing homes must be sold 
  before many consumers can take advantage of the credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our recent survey indicates that farm loan demand is unusually 
  strong at banks, PCAs, and the FMHA. Demand is strongest for 
  operating loans, weakest for farm mortgage loans. This is at least 
  partially due to the fact that farm suppliers have largely withdrawn 
  from the credit business and now require payment for their goods on 
  delivery. Availability of bank loan funds this spring, compared with 
  last fall, generally shows improvement, markedly so in some cases. 
  At banks which had some bad lending experiences in other fields last 
  year, and at small rural banks, availability of funds is generally 
  down. One large district bank reports that some of its small 
  correspondents are buying federal funds in order to meet this demand 
  for agricultural production credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, the majority of our bankers do not appear to be 
  reluctant to expand their farm loan volume this spring. But they are 
  apparently taking a hard look at the credit worthiness of their 
  borrowers. Volume of loan referrals to nonbank credit agencies seems 
  to be about the same as last year. There appears to be some increase 
  in the volume of participation loans with FMHA, however.
