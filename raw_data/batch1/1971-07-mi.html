      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

      <strong>
       July 21, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       Judging from the responses of the directors and branch directors of 
this bank, consumer spending in the District has increased over the 
last month. At the same time, savings flows to commercial banks are 
still relatively strong, although there are indications that some 
tapering has occurred at reserve city banks. Unions in the District 
do not seem to have tempered their wage demands in recently settled 
wage contracts or current bargaining sessions. The demand for 
agricultural loans seems to have abated over the past few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales in various parts of the District seem to be 
strengthening, and a few directors felt that retailers in their 
areas were optimistically looking at the future. Most responses were 
that retail sales in June and early July were better than in May and 
considerably above a year ago; a number of directors were aware of 
June sales by individual retailers in their areas which were more 
than 15 per cent above a year ago. Those directors who felt that 
retail sales had not risen, particularly in Montana, were careful to 
point out that retail sales in their areas were relatively strong in 
earlier months this year and therefore would not be expected to rise 
dramatically.
      </p>
      <p>
       There appear to be divergent trends in various components of retail 
sales. Soft lines seem fairly strong, while consumers apparently are 
limiting purchases of durable goods and luxury items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings patterns in the District seem to be diverging as well. With 
one exception, savings flows to District banks outside the Twin 
Cities continued as strong in June as in earlier months this year. 
The one exception was in the Sioux Falls area, but the slowing, 
according to one banker, was not really enough to mention. Savings 
flows to reserve city banks have slowed, however. One director noted 
a savings run-off at a reserve city bank following the July 1 
interest crediting period and inflows during early July which were a 
little slower than in previous months.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a number of major labor contracts currently being negotiated in 
the District, it does not appear that union wage demands have eased. 
In upper Michigan, the contract between the White Pine Copper 
Company and the United Steelworkers is scheduled to expire at the 
end of July, and negotiations began earlier this month. It was not 
possible to learn what terms are being considered, as neither 
negotiating team was willing to divulge this information. In the 
Twin Cities, a strike by sand and gravel haulers, which began during 
the first weekend in June, seriously curtailed construction activity 
until early this week. The union asked for an increase of $3.00 per 
hour over the next three years, but was content to settle for $2.75 
over the three-year contract period. 'This was essentially the same 
size of settlement that other construction unions have won over the 
past two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Anaconda Company, with a Montana employment in excess of 6,000, 
was struck on July 1, but the directors from that area were 
optimistic about the duration of the strike. The company has offered 
a 32 per cent increase in wages and fringes over the next three 
years, but this was rejected by the union. Although it was not 
possible to determine the counter offer, the directors felt that 
unsettled issues were more concerned with work rules and 
productivity problems than with the size of the offered wage 
increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Partially reacting to the high rate of unemployment in the area, 
unions in the La Crosse, Wisconsin, area seem to have lowered their 
sights somewhat and have been accepting contracts calling for wage 
increases of about 6 per cent. This philosophy has not permeated the 
construction industry, however, where laborers and carpenters are 
currently striking for a 12 per cent pay increase.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for agricultural loans at banks in the Ninth Federal Reserve 
District has moderated somewhat in recent months, according to our 
latest agricultural credit conditions survey. This phenomenon has 
occurred as a result of the improved flow of farm income during the 
second quarter which lessened the strong need for short-term loans. 
On the other hand, the demand for long-term, or real estate, loans 
has increased because of a decline in long-term interest rates. 
These declining rates have been particularly effective in 
encouraging more loan requests due to the backlog of farmers' long-term spending plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers seem to expect that the overall farm credit demand will 
continue somewhat lower. These anticipations reflect both the 
recently improved farm income situation and the expectation that 
farm incomes will continue to improve. Some respondents expressed 
caution in this outlook, however, pointing out that higher incomes 
were the result of currently high prices for several important farm 
products, and that it was very possible that these prices could fall 
over the next few months.
