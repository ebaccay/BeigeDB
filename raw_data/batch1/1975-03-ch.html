      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The business downturn continues in the Seventh District. The rate of 
  decline may be slowing, but there are no indications of a near-term 
  improvement in general conditions. The drop in manufacturing 
  employment and output since October has not been matched since 1945-46, and pessimism has not been so deep and widespread since the 
  1930's. Consumers are buying cautiously, business firms are 
  attempting to cut costs (often reducing staffs), many companies are 
  reducing capital expenditure plans, and lenders are more selective 
  in making new commitments. Reflecting reduced demand, including 
  inventory liquidation, the rate of inflation has slowed 
  substantially and many prices have been reduced.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regardless of estimates of overall rates of unemployment, it appears 
  that job markets weakened further in February and March. 
  Deterioration has been especially marked in the central cities of 
  Chicago and Milwaukee. (Detroit remains a disaster area, despite 
  recent call-backs of laid-off workers.) Waves of layoffs have 
  continued in a wide variety of durable goods industries, which are 
  predominant in this region. Construction activity is at a very low 
  level, and freight tonnage is down sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although techniques leave much to be desired, state agencies have 
  been attempting to estimate unemployment in central cities, in 
  addition to metropolitan areas as in the past. For the city of 
  Chicago, unemployment is estimated at 8.5 percent in February, 
  compared with 7.2 percent for the SMSA. For the city of Milwaukee, 
  which had been relatively vigorous, the unemployment rate is 
  estimated at 11 percent for January, compared with 6.5 percent for 
  the SMSA, and 16 percent for a 15 square mile area within the city. 
  The current picture is undoubtedly worse.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Chicago, a discount department store to be opened in May 
  processed 5,600 applications for 300 prospective jobs. A job 
  conference for prospective college graduates in marketing was able 
  to accept only 800 of 1,400 applicants for interviews, compared with 
  a total of 350 applicants a year ago. The weakness of the job market 
  reflects not only layoffs but hiring freezes and a sharply reduced 
  rate of voluntary separations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some unions have moderated demands for upcoming negotiations. 
  Chicago area construction laborers agreed to forego a wage increase 
  for 1975, and electricians will work a four-day week and will accept 
  an unspecified pay cut. Some employers, however, say union militancy 
  is as strong as ever, even when layoffs are large and continuing. 
  Some employers have reduced the wages and benefits of white collar 
  workers and are asking unions to accept similar reductions. However, 
  a survey showed average compensation of executives in the Chicago 
  area to have increased 16 percent from May 1, 1974 to January 1, 
  1975, compared with a 10 percent rise in the average from 1972 to 
  1973.
     </p>
     <p>
      A search for favorable developments yielded scattered and 
  inconclusive reports of increased orders for metal stampings, 
  cardboard cartons, textiles and mobile homes. Some of these reports 
  may indicate the need to correct excessive inventory reductions. 
  Most of the heavy capital goods industries continue to operate at 
  high levels, although with declining backlogs. Auto companies are 
  increasing output schedules through May. Previous drastic cutbacks 
  in output and the sales stimulus of cash rebates resulted in 
  unbalanced inventories. If demand does not pick up a solid basis, 
  these assembly schedules probably will not hold up.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Perhaps no industry was hit so suddenly and so hard by reduced sales 
    and order cancellations as heavy trucks. Plants producing components 
    and finished vehicles that were fighting to reduce heavy backlogs 
    last summer are now operating at about 30 percent of capacity. 
    Experts have been surprised at the rapid turnaround, even those who 
    had forecast a substantial drop-off. A small producer of heavy 
    trucks is in bankruptcy proceedings, Chrysler has pulled out of the 
    market, and marginal plants are being taken out of production "permanently". Highway freight tonnage is down 25 percent from last 
    year. The largest drop in any earlier recession since World War II 
    was 10 percent. Moreover, many trucks had been sold and produced 
    with a view to "beating" the costly air-brake standards that became 
    effective March 1. The current inventory of heavy trucks is equal to 
    about six months' prospective sales. There are signs that demand for 
    heavy construction equipment will soon start down, although probably 
    not so rapidly as in the case of heavy trucks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <p>
        Price cuts on manufactured goods have been substantial and 
  widespread, both at the wholesale and retail levels, perhaps to a 
  greater extent than at any time since World War II. Many of these 
  price cuts, e.g., auto rebates and department store markdowns, 
  represent attempts to reduce inventories on hand and will not be 
  permanent. Most costs of production continue to rise, and various 
  manufacturers without inventory problems are raising prices. Prices 
  of some models of autos have been "reduced" by changing the product, 
  e.g., substituting lower grade tires. Prices of services continue to 
  rise rapidly, including apartment rents, hospital care, utility 
  rates, insurance rates, and professional services. Many prices of 
  goods had been at unsustainable levels in view of market forces. 
  Some types of steel are coming down, most nonferrous metals are 
  cheaper, and gasoline stations are in a minor price war. Many price 
  adjustments are indirectâ€”a return to freight absorption, 
  elimination of extras and surcharges, and restoration of quantity 
  and cash discounts. Individual negotiations between buyers and 
  sellers are more likely to result in lower prices. Overall, price 
  reductions on goods probably are not fully reflected in official 
  indexes.
