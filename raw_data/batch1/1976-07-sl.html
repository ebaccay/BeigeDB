      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales, production, and employment continue up in the Eight District, 
  although at somewhat reduced rates according to reports from 
  businessmen. Retail sales at department stores continued up at about 
  the same pace as last month. Manufacturing activity is mixed. 
  Automobile production is strong, but appliance orders have slowed 
  recently. Home building continues to make gains, and mortgage rates 
  have remained unchanged in recent weeks. Business loans at banks 
  have likewise remained unchanged, although consumer loans have 
  registered further increases. In the agricultural sector, most field 
  crops except cotton are reported to be in generally good condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth in retail sales has continued in recent weeks, and retailers 
  remain generally optimistic about future sales. Automobile sales 
  have continued to make sizable gains from year ago levels. 
  Department store sales have likewise increased; however, sales of 
  some items at department stores have leveled off due, in part, to 
  unusually cool weather in June and early July, which discouraged the 
  sale of air conditioning and summer-ware items. Most software items 
  were reported to be selling very well. Department store retailers 
  report their inventories at desired levels, but some car dealers 
  reported very low inventories of full-sized automobiles.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity has generally improved from a month ago, but 
  again the rate of gain has apparently slowed during recent weeks. 
  Appliance manufacturers, for example, note a slowing in orders of 
  refrigerators, freezers, and similar items. This is thought to 
  partially reflect a slowdown in growth of inventory demand rather 
  than final demand. Inventories of appliances, it was pointed out, 
  were built up quickly in the earlier months of the year and are now 
  largely at desired levels. Capital equipment manufacturers reported 
  that capital equipment demand has been improving in recent weeks. 
  Demand for equipment by utilities was reported to be low compared 
  with recent years, but such demand is expected to improve next year. 
  Automobile assembly plants producing the larger size cars have been 
  at full capacity, though some plants in the St. Louis area are now 
  undergoing extensive retooling. Aircraft manufacturing was reported 
  to be stable. Defense-oriented aircraft production is fairly strong 
  and increases are expected as defense spending increases. However, 
  commercial aircraft production is still reported to be sluggish.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of reporters commented on the possibility that plant 
  capacity was generally well below levels projected on the basis of 
  trend for recent years. A representative of a major chemical firm 
  indicated that obsolescence during the last two years was much 
  greater than normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      The home building industry remains on the uptrend in the District 
  and commercial construction is beginning to increase. Single-family 
  construction continues to proceed at a fairly strong pace, while 
  multi-family construction is still at a very low level and has shown 
  only modest improvement recently. Industry representatives expect a "shortage" of multi-family units in some areas of the District this 
  fall if construction does not pick up significantly. Concern was 
  also expressed about the sustainability of the upturn in single-family housing in view of the sharp price increases in homes and the 
  possibility of higher interest rates. While commercial construction 
  remains very low compared with most recent years, reports indicate 
  that it is beginning to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall employment gains have been registered in the District in 
  recent weeks. Several businessmen commented that qualified workers 
  were hard to find, despite the relatively high unemployment rates. 
  Unemployment rates are below 5 percent in several of the smaller 
  metropolitan areas, while in Memphis and Louisville, where the 
  recovery has been somewhat weaker than that of the nation, the 
  unemployment rate is substantially above the national average.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan associations have experienced a slowing in deposit 
  growth in recent weeks. However, funds are still reported to be 
  quite plentiful for home construction as most associations still 
  have sizable amounts of uncommitted funds accumulated from earlier 
  deposit gains. The cost of mortgage funds has generally remained in 
  the range of 8 1/2 to 8 3/4 percent in the St. Louis area. Business 
  loan demand at banks has been unchanged in recent weeks, while 
  demand for consumer installment loans has picked up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crops are reported to be in generally good condition in the Eighth 
  District. However, the prospects for the cotton crop are uncertain 
  at this time. Late planting, cold spring weather, and excessive 
  rainfall threaten to severely affect cotton yields. In several 
  areas, 10 percent of the cotton crop has been plowed under and put 
  into other crops, primarily soybeans. Hence, soybean acreage and 
  production probably will be above earlier estimates. Poultry 
  production is reported at a high level, although observers pointed 
  out that further price declines for poultry meats would lead to 
  cutbacks in production.
