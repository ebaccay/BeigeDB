      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       According to bank directors, District businessmen believe that Phase 
II has not been very successful in bringing inflation under control 
and stated that the Pay Board's recent reorganization would not 
alter its effectiveness. Although employment growth was expected to 
improve, no significant reduction in unemployment was foreseen for 
the second quarter. Twin Cities retail sales in the first quarter 
were up modestly from a year ago and are expected to improve in the 
second quarter. In addition, District first quarter new car sales 
were quite strong and, due to improved farm income, District farm 
machinery sales strengthened in the first quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although they feel Phase II has helped, bank directors reported that 
District businessmen are not convinced that the Administration's 
efforts are bringing inflation under control. Given the large wage 
increases that have been permitted, one director reported that his 
area's businessmen consider further inflation inevitable. The only 
alternatives to Phase II mentioned by District businessmen were a 
wage-price freeze or some type of rigid controls. Because they felt 
both alternatives are unworkable, the general feeling was that now 
inflation would persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank directors indicated that the recent resignation of labor 
leaders from the Pay Board would not jeopardize that body's 
effectiveness. In fact, the consensus was that the labor leaders had 
thwarted the Pay Board's past efforts and that it would probably be 
more effective in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although employment growth was expected to improve, a survey of 
employment security offices in 16 of the District's largest labor 
areas revealed that generally no reduction in unemployment was 
anticipated. When asked to characterize the outlook for employment 
growth during the next 90 days, one respondent termed it as 
"excellent," nine considered it "good," and five called it "fair." 
Ten of the respondents looked for job openings in their areas to be 
up from a year ago, with eight terming the increase "slight," while 
two expected job openings to match last year's level. Four 
respondents anticipated job openings to be down from a year earlier. 
In spite of these encouraging responses, no reduction in 
unemployment was foreseen. Eight respondents indicated that second 
quarter unemployment would be up from a year ago with five 
respondents calling the increase "slight." Seven respondents 
disclosed that unemployment would probably match last year's second 
quarter level in their areas. However, a labor market analyst for 
the Minneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan Area, which accounts for a 
third of the District's employment, looked for second quarter 
unemployment to be down slightly from a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       A telephone survey of five major retailers located in the Twin 
Cities revealed that their sales were up from a year ago. One 
respondent, however, called his firm's first quarter sales growth 
soft and the increase experienced by three other firms could be 
termed moderate. The first quarter Minnesota sales of one large 
company's department and discount stores were up 4.2 per cent from a 
year ago, while a chain of discount stores reported a 5 per cent 
year-to-year sales increase in February and March. All respondents 
indicated that their sales gains in March were stronger than those 
recorded in January and February. In general, these respondents were 
optimistic about their expected second quarter sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a regional sales manager, new car sales were quite 
strong in the first quarter. The sales of automobiles produced by 
Ford and Chrysler were up markedly from a year ago. Chevrolet sales 
exceeded last year's level by 35.0 per cent in February and 9.1 per 
cent in March. Although other GM Divisions experienced first quarter 
year-to-year sales declines, these managers were quite pleased with 
this year's sales, as these decreases can be attributed to the 
recovery from the 1970 automobile strike which inflated their first 
quarter automobile sales last year. First quarter American Motors 
sales were only 1.4 per cent above a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       District farm income strengthened in the first quarter which induced 
District farmers to spend much more heavily on farm equipment. An ad 
hoc survey of Ninth District area sales offices of farm equipment 
and farm supply firms revealed that equipment sales ranged from "no 
change" to "20 per cent greater" than sales in the first quarter of 
1971. The latest published data on farm tractor sales show that the 
number of units sold in the District during January was 19 per cent 
larger than the number sold one year earlier. Practically all of the 
equipment manufacturers in our ad hoc survey reported that their 
first quarter sales could have been greater had not the increase in 
demand caught them without adequate inventories.
