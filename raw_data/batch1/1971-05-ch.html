      <p>
       A number of important industries have experienced a turn for the 
better in the past several weeks. Retail trade apparently has 
improved, and there is some concern for the adequacy of inventories 
if consumer demand accelerates. Prospects for residential 
construction appear even stronger than in earlier months, and there 
is a growing tendency to project the vigorous picture into 1972. 
Capital-expenditure prospects generally remain unfavorable, but 
petroleum firms have raised their sights on investment spending. 
Markets for goods are more competitive, and price increases have 
been less frequent in recent weeks. Demand for labor remains very 
slow, and unemployment apparently is continuing to rise in this 
region. Crop plantings are ahead of schedule, and larger acreage is 
being planted. Funds continue to pour into savings media, but demand 
for credit, other than for residential construction, remains at 
reduced levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two recent meetings of business economists in Chicago sounded a more 
optimistic tone than at any time in the past year. Among the 
manufacturers reporting a firmer trend in orders or sales were 
producers of building materials, components for industrial equipment 
other than "heavy stuff", light and heavy motor trucks, petroleum 
production equipment, nonautomotive consumer durables, farm 
equipment, and meat products. Reports on retail trade were more 
favorable, but the improvements noted have been modest. Demand for 
airline services remains poor, and service is being curtailed. Steel 
shipments have been somewhat less than anticipated, and order 
backlogs "probably have peaked". Demand for most machinery and 
equipment, and industrial and commercial buildings, has not 
improved, and little hope exists that a significant upswing will 
occur in the next several months.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Chicago area, demand for virtually all types of workers experienced, inexperienced, newly trained, and those with 
established skills-is said to be the weakest in "at least a decade". 
For some types of workers such as school teachers, and graduates of 
technical schools, the comparison must be pushed back further—perhaps to the late 1930's. One large university reports that only 
25 percent of its seniors have firm offers of jobs, compared with 85 
percent two years ago. The summer job prospect for students is said 
to be "hopeless". Construction unions are much more restrictive in 
issuing job permits to nonunion members, stating that many of their 
own members are out of work. Because of financial stringencies, many 
school districts have reduced, or will reduce, their hirings. 
Applications for teaching jobs are extremely numerous. Enrollment in 
many colleges and graduate schools is down this year, and further 
reductions are expected for the fall term. The effect of reduced 
college enrollment, of course, is twofold: fewer teachers are 
needed, and more potential students are in the labor force. Even 
banks have begun to limit hirings, and encourage early retirements. 
Voluntary quits are much less common than a year ago. As a result, 
fewer people are in job training programs. Available jobs are 
largely in low-paid service positions and in commission sales work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction activity is picking up rapidly in most 
areas of the District. Nevertheless, ample supplies of workers are 
available in virtually all building trades. In the Chicago area, 
with a 31 percent rise in residential permits in the first quarter, 
60 percent were for apartments, compared with more than 70 percent a 
year earlier. Available sites for new residential projects will 
become an increasing problem if the housing boom continues, mainly 
because of zoning and code restrictions. Recent municipal elections 
in Chicago suburban areas favored candidates opposed to multiple 
residences, especially low-income housing. Mortgage money is 
increasingly available at lower rates and easier terms. The "equity 
kicker" deals for financing apartment buildings, common in 1969 and 
1970, have about disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warm temperatures and relatively dry fields have permitted earlier 
than normal soil preparation and corn plantings in the Midwest. As a 
result, the increase in acreage planted may be even larger than the 
4 percent rise expected earlier. Larger acreage may encourage 
purchases of farm equipment. Demand for farm equipment had been very 
weak earlier in the year, but sales are reported to have improved 
recently. Farmland values are reported to be rising moderately 
again, after leveling off last year. Agricultural banks are 
experiencing increased demand for farm loans. Because of rapid 
deposit growth, bankers hope to expand loans this year because loan 
rates (about 7 1/2 percent) are much more favorable than rates 
available on investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business loan demand at large city banks remains very slow, and may 
have weakened further in the past month. Nevertheless, the recent 
rise in the prime rate was not considered a surprise, partly because 
earlier reductions were believed to have been excessive. Some city 
banks are expanding mortgage and construction loan activities. 
Savings inflows continue very heavy at banks and savings and loan 
associations. Rates paid on passbook savings and consumer-type 
certificates have been reduced by a growing number of commercial 
banks in the District, but the large Chicago loop banks have not 
reduced these rates and are not expected to do so in 1971. A 
significant volume of the inflow of funds to savings and time 
accounts represents money that had been invested in bills and 
similar instruments. Recent increases in rates paid on CD's by large 
banks, and some extension of maturities, indicate that banks are 
relying more heavily on this source of funds as a substitute for 
Euro-dollars.
