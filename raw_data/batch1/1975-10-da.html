      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the suspension of the oil depletion allowance, drilling 
activity in Texas continues at a rate nearly 20 percent ahead of a 
year ago. Higher prices for new oil and natural gas sold in the 
intrastate market account for most of the 7,855 wells drilled so far 
this year. Most efforts, however, are concentrated on developmental 
drilling—recovering more oil from proven fields—while riskier 
exploratory drilling has been deemphasized. Lack of a national 
energy policy is cited as the major factor that has led oilmen to 
steer away from high-risk ventures. Exploratory drilling offshore, 
for example, has come to a virtual standstill.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Increased drilling activity worldwide has continued to fuel the 
demand for oil field equipment. The state's largest manufacturer of 
oil field equipment estimates demand is running 25 percent ahead of 
a year ago. Several producers report a year's production of unfilled 
orders on their books. Industry suppliers are also experiencing 
brisk sales. Some steel fabricators, for example, have been able to 
sustain high production levels by shifting resources to their oil 
field equipment business and away from construction-related 
products.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current upswing in the Texas industrial production index has 
been largely due to the recovery in petrochemicals—the biggest 
sector in the index. Chemical manufacturers now warn the recovery 
may be short-lived. The recent strength has been mainly due to a 
heavy influx of orders by user industries to replenish inventories. 
But because purchases by users are currently outpacing their sales, 
new orders are expected to fall once stocks have been brought up to 
desired levels. The upturn in chemical production, which is 
dependent on petroleum-based feed stocks, has stimulated much of the 
10 percent increase in crude oil refining since May.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparel and textile manufacturers also report production continues 
to grow on a deluge of new orders that began last April. Clothing 
retailers, especially large chain stores, are rebuilding 
inventories. One indication of the strength of the wholesale market 
was the quantity of orders placed by retailers with manufacturers 
last summer. According to one industry spokesman, area manufacturers 
accepted one-third more orders than they could comfortably produce 
without extending delivery schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commensurate with increased manufacturing activity, the labor market 
for production workers in Texas continues to improve. After 
declining during the first half of the year, factory employment has 
risen since July, and the trend will likely continue. The average 
manufacturing workweek, seasonally adjusted, is 40.9 hours, 
substantially above the February low of 39.7 hours. Moreover, the 
layoff rates for major Texas cities have been at least halved since 
January, and recent gains in the quit rates suggest workers sense 
job prospects are improving.
      </p>
      <p>
       A survey of new car dealers indicates consumer interest in the new 
models is much higher than it was a year ago. Improved gas mileage 
and a smaller increase in sticker prices were cited for the more 
favorable reception of the 1976 models. In addition, buyers appear 
more willing to accept the added expense of optional equipment. (It 
must be remembered, however, that this year's models come stripped 
down, and the back seat in one car is optional.) A Fort Worth dealer 
feels buyers plan to keep their new cars longer and are willing to 
spend more for a model equipped for their individual needs. Several 
dealers warn that sales this year may be slowed by a shortage of new 
cars. Auto workers appear reluctant to work overtime this fall and 
heavy demands for some smaller models are expected to keep dealer 
inventories below desired levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since April, sales at Eleventh District department stores have been 
increasing at a brisk pace. Over the past 60 days, however, the 
composition of sales has changed somewhat as there has been a marked 
pickup in purchases of durable goods, especially big-ticket items. 
Executives with the leading stores attribute much of the increase to 
greater response to a normal level of promotional activity. The 
manager of a Dallas store points out that recent big-ticket 
purchases were being made by customers who differ from the typical 
buyer two or three years ago. Then, customers were predominantly 
interested in buying "the top of the line," with prices playing a 
secondary role. Today's buyers, on the other hand, are extremely 
price conscious and are trading down in their purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agricultural conditions in the Eleventh District remain generally 
favorable. Harvests of corn and grain sorghum are about two-thirds 
complete and ahead of last year's pace. The cotton harvest is on 
schedule but only one-fourth finished. Cold, wet weather on the High 
and Low Plains of Texas late last month has substantially reduced 
the expected yield of cotton from September 1 estimates. Wheat 
seeding is progressing well, but much of the dryland crop needs rain 
to establish a stand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Livestock are in good condition. However, top soil moisture is 
limited, and fall grazing prospects are deteriorating. Heavy 
marketing of livestock continues as ranchers closely cull herds in 
anticipation of high feed costs this winter. The number of cattle 
and calves slaughtered in Texas through August of this year is 42 
percent larger than in the same period of 1974 and compares with 
only a 16 percent increase for the nation.
