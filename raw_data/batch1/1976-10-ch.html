      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The past month has produced no solid evidence from Seventh District 
  sources that the tone of less vigorous growth and general caution 
  reported in previous months will soon change, either for better or 
  worse. There are no problems with shortages either currently or 
  anticipated in the near future. Expectations of a near-term 
  acceleration in price inflation for manufactured goods have 
  moderated. Large retailers report good levels of sales, but somewhat 
  less than had been anticipated. Demand for capital goods, overall, 
  has not improved significantly with increases in some lines about 
  balancing declines in others. The single-family housing boom 
  continues, but prospective increases in other types of construction 
  are relatively moderate. The supply of loanable funds remains ample 
  in all sectors. Although it is commonly asserted that the November 
  elections "will not change anything," many observers believe that 
  uncertainties related to a possible change in the political 
  environment are partly responsible for caution in executive decision 
  making.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chicago area purchasing managers report for September shows somewhat 
  higher rates of increase for new orders, output, and backlogs. 
  Slightly over half of the group expects better business activity in 
  the fourth quarter, compared to the third quarter, against only 9 
  percent who see a decline. For the first quarter of 1977, 70 percent 
  expect an improvement, while 10 percent see a decline. The 
  proportion reporting higher prices paid dropped to 53 percent in 
  September, about the same as a year ago, but down from 75 percent in 
  both July and August. However, the proportion reporting lower prices 
  paid has been virtually zero for the past twelve months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although price increases continue, most boosts are smaller than 
  expected and others are being delayed awaiting stronger markets. 
  Steel producers, having canceled the boost for sheet scheduled for 
  October 1, are anxious to please customers with promises of quick 
  delivery and improved quality and service. Paper companies report 
  similar conditions. The main products for which lead times have 
  lengthened significantly recently are various electrical components, 
  but no one speaks of shortages. Some concern had existed several 
  months ago as to the availability of ferrous and nonferrous 
  castings, but a diversified independent foundry says "when do you 
  want it?" A very large general merchandiser expects prices paid and 
  received for consumer goods to average 4 percent higher in 1976 and 
  sees a 4.2 percent average rise for 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      The increase in retail sales from year-ago in most Seventh District 
  areas seems to be about in line with the rise in disposable income. 
  Purchases of motor vehicles continue strong with only a minor loss 
  thus far because of the Ford strike. One Chicago area lender has 
  begun to advertise 48-month car loans, but most banks have held to 
  36 months, except for very good risks. Consumer credit experience 
  has been favorable. Television sales are up significantly this year, 
  but not as much as expected, and Japanese imports are taking a 
  larger share of the market. Another Seventh District TV producer 
  recently was acquired by Japanese interests.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers continue to spend freely for travel and entertainment. A 
  major airline reports the increase in air travel to be above 
  expectations, with trips to Hawaii near capacity. A large amusement 
  park, which opened north of Chicago in late spring, started slow, 
  but now expects two million guests this year. Outlays per family 
  average at least $50, with many waiting out long lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      Exhibitors of the international machine tool show held in Chicago in 
  mid-September gave mixed reports on business generated. There was 
  great interest in new labor-saving machines. For example, some 
  machine tools now can operate for two days unattended. Wisconsin 
  producers of large machine tools say that orders for big units are "beginning to move." Several companies see a gain of about 20 
  percent in orders for 1977 with a marked improvement already 
  underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for large earth-moving equipment continues to lag badly, and 
  one producer has just reported a layoff. However, this company is 
  stepping up production of front end loaders, mainly smaller units, 
  which had been cut back.
     </p>
     <p>
      Slow demand for producer equipment in general is the main factor 
  causing steel producers to reduce forecasts of consumption. Various 
  reports from architects, engineering firms, contractors, and zoning 
  authorities indicate some revival in nonresidential construction 
  activity, but mainly for smaller projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apartment building permits granted in the Chicago area are running 
  far above last year, but are only a fraction of the level of the 
  early 1970's. Lenders are much more cautious than a few years ago 
  and some overhang of vacant units remains, but, most important, 
  current rentals do not justify most plans offered by promoters.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major airline has placed a substantial order for new
      <br/>
      B727-200's to 
  replace older DC 8's. This order was not expected to be placed so 
  soon.
     </p>
     <p>
      Traffic has improved, but the major factor is lower fuel consumption 
  by the new aircraft. One railroad has placed a substantial order for 
  locomotives and freight cars with District producers, but railroad 
  capital spending, overall, is still far below the levels required to 
  maintain the systems properly.
