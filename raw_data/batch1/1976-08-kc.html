      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending has settled down in District department stores but 
  not in domestic new-car dealer showrooms, where full-size luxury 
  models are nearly sold out and where orders for new models are 
  already strong. Chain store managers, despite their lackluster 
  summer sales, expect good business in the months ahead, report 
  slightly heavy inventories, and foresee fairly stable prices for 
  their merchandise. The outlook for food prices, meanwhile, is very 
  uncertain, given the mixture of offsetting forces affecting farm 
  prices. Banks report some increase in agricultural loans but none in 
  business loans. Car buying continues to give moderate growth to 
  consumer loans. Despite the current weakness, most bankers expect 
  the prime rate to rise but not by much.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports vary, but the rate of growth of retail sales by District 
  department stores apparently has slowed considerably this summer, 
  and projections for fall and winter have been revised downward in 
  many cases. July sales by some stores in Kansas City and Denver were 
  strong, but in Wichita, Oklahoma City, and Omaha, business was 
  sluggish. These mixed reports contrast sharply with the uniformly 
  exuberant responses received this spring, so that some slowing in 
  retail trade can be inferred. Department store officials say they 
  are not pessimistic, just reconciled to a good year instead of a 
  great one. Several noted that sales last fall and winter were 
  exceptionally strong, and that they are now hoping to do as well 
  after once "wishfully thinking" that they could do better. Most 
  store managers say that their current inventories are a little 
  heavy, although they expect to be "clean and in good shape" by fall, 
  implying some liquidation soon. The prices paid for merchandise by 
  retail outlets have been holding the line, and store managers doubt 
  if they will have to raise prices at retail very much in the next 
  six months to a year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Big American cars are the hottest summer item in new-car dealer lots 
  throughout the District. Intermediate sizes are selling well, too, 
  with compacts and subcompacts attracting the least interest. Luxury-car dealers report exceptionally good sales and complain of 
  inadequate inventories of full-size models. The same story is heard 
  from dealers in the lower priced domestic makes, although they note 
  some recent up-tick in sales of compacts, perhaps due to the lack of 
  selection in the larger models. Stripped-down versions are the 
  exceptions, optional equipment the rule, with many of the sportier 
  versions sold "loaded". Foreign-car dealers report little traffic, 
  with "no shortages of cars, just customers". Domestic dealers are 
  optimistic about the new-model year, while foreign-car dealers are 
  hopeful.
     </p>
     <p>
      After remaining unchanged for the month ended July 15, farm prices 
  have turned weaker, with the declines for hogs and wheat being 
  particularly significant. The outlook for farm prices for the rest 
  of 1976 is clouded by uncertainties arising from the weather, total 
  demand, and recent reports on livestock inventories. Cattle prices 
  are currently much lower than anticipated earlier, reflecting 
  vigorous flows of marketings from both the feedlots and the 
  pastures. The July 1 inventory of cattle, which was down 5 percent 
  from a year ago, points to a substantial reduction in cattle numbers 
  for 1976 as a whole. However, the 17 percent increase in the number 
  of cattle on feed as of July 1, with some concentration in the 
  heavier weights, suggests that total slaughter will remain 
  relatively large through at least the remainder of the year. This 
  implies only modest price increases in the period ahead. Assuming a 
  continuation of these trends, however, beef supplies in 1977 will 
  likely be curtailed, perhaps significantly, and prices will probably 
  rise. Larger supplies of pork and poultry would have a dampening 
  effect, however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another element in the cattle picture hinges on the size of the 1976 
  corn crop and the cost of feed. Due to the prospects for a low 
  carryover of grain this fall, feed prices will likely remain 
  relatively high until a bumper crop is assured. If grain prices 
  remain relatively high, placements of cattle in feedlots will likely 
  taper off, which will ultimately reduce beef output and increase 
  prices. A big crop, however, would have the opposite effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among District banks contacted, business loan demand did not 
  increase in July relative to its level in June. Several banks do 
  report increases in loans to agribusinesses and to farmers for 
  financing current operations and for storing grain. Most of this 
  increase in loans is being generated by overlines from correspondent 
  banks. Some banks also report more inquiries about real estate 
  construction financing, although few of these have been translated 
  into actual loans. Consumer loan growth has been moderate, with car 
  sales being the strongest area of gain.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the banks contacted have been slow to move down to the 7 
  percent prime rate, with some still posting a rate of
      <br/>
      7 1/2 percent. 
  Despite the current weakness in the rate, the majority of bankers in 
  our survey expect the prime rate to rise by the year-end, although 
  to no more than an 8 percent level. One banker, however, predicts 
  that the rate will fall below the present level. Two important 
  factors are viewed as limiting the size of future increases: the 
  slow pace of economic recovery in areas other than consumer 
  spending, and the weak loan demand at New York City banks.
