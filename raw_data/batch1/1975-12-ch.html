     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity appears to be improving very gradually despite 
many uncertainties. Layoffs are less frequent, but few employers are 
hiring actively. Retail sales were held down in November by 
unseasonably mild weather, but most merchants contend that Christmas 
volume will be good, at least compared with last year's depressed 
level. Many manufacturing companies are continuing to reduce 
inventories, but others have completed adjustments, and retailers' 
stocks generally are on the low side. All goods and services are in 
amp1e supply and most markets are competitive, but prices of 
manufactured goods continue to rise. Various companies are 
reevaluating capital spending plans because of ample capacity and 
high costs of equipment and new construction. Developers of new 
residential subdivisions are active again after a long period of 
hibernation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers complained that warm weather during most of November held 
down sales of seasonal merchandise. Sales of nonseasonal items were 
also hurt because of the adverse effect of weather on customer 
"traffic." Colder weather and snow in recent weeks has had a 
salutary effect. A revival in sales in December could easily offset 
the November performance as it has so often in the past. Producers 
of appliances and television sets have been disappointed by the 
level of demand for their products. Retail inventories are generally 
low and could limit total Christmas volume because most buying 
commitments were made in October.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of autos and small trucks are much improved from last year's 
depressed level but remain well below the rates of two or three 
years ago. Most auto industry analysts do not expect that new peaks 
in sales will be achieved until 1980 or later. Some analysts of 
markets for appliances and televisions hold similar views.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of heavy trucks remain depressed despite a pronounced pickup 
in freight movements since last spring. The new brake systems 
required since March 1 are said to be holding down sales because of 
fears of malfunctions and resulting heavy damage suits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all goods and services are readily available from 
suppliers. One exception is quality shoes and boots. No significant 
supply problems are anticipated for petroleum products. Gasoline 
prices weakened in early November, but part of the decline has since 
been restored. While markets for most goods are competitive compared 
with the period prior to the fall of 1974, most prices are holding 
up or rising further because of cost pressures resulting from boosts 
in wages and benefits, and rising costs for utilities, insurance, 
and other needs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fourth-quarter steel shipments will be the lowest for the year and 
somewhat below earlier expectations. Heavier steels for equipment 
have weakened further while demand for steel for consumer products 
has picked up. Some major projects to expand steel capacity have 
been halted or are being reevaluated. One steel company says its 
expansion program is going ahead full steam, but this statement 
appears to apply to projects already started.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some diversified capital goods producers who had been cutting output 
say that the decline has about ended and that recalls of workers are 
probable after the turn of the year. New orders for railroad 
equipment are at very low levels, but shipments have declined only 
moderately as substantial order backlogs are worked off. Demand for 
small construction equipment will revive if the expected improvement 
in home building materializes. Farm equipment sales are expected to 
rise next year because of higher than expected cash receipts and 
anticipated heavy plantings of crops.
     </p>
     <p>
      The dollar volume of transfers of existing homes and apartments has 
been very high in recent months while prices have been maintained or 
have increased further. Residential developers are "starting the 
process" once again after about 18 months of inactivity but mainly 
for single-family home projects. Construction loans are available at 
about 10 percent, compared to 14 percent or more during the crunch, 
but lenders are very careful in evaluating new risks. Inventories of 
unsold apartments have been reduced substantially, but it is 
unlikely that new apartment building will rebound vigorously. A 
large new hotel was started recently in downtown Chicago, and some 
shopping centers are still being completed. But commercial building 
prospects remain poor. Office vacancy rates are about 14 percent 
downtown both in Milwaukee and in Chicago and are even higher in 
outlying areas. This compared with an "acceptable" rate of 5 to 7 
percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto insurance companies are pushing for large rate increases, 12 to 
20 percent, to eliminate underwriting deficits, although increases 
of similar magnitude had already been posted this year. Soaring 
claims for property damage and personal liability are responsible. 
Increases in rates on homeowners' policies also have been very 
large. Costs of malpractice insurance for doctors, hospitals, and 
other professionals and for manufacturers' product liability have 
multiplied in recent years and are still rising rapidly. There is 
also a push for shorter-term insurance policies, perhaps to a half-year for auto insurance.
