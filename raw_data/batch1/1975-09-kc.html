      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

       September 10, 1975

     <p>
      Two important barometers of construction activity in the Tenth 
District continue to depict a weak and struggling construction 
sector. Interviews with home builders revealed a dichotomy in the 
market, with higher priced houses selling well while the lower 
priced sector remains depressed. However, almost all respondents 
paint a very bleak housing picture for the future. In District 
agriculture, the recent rains have generally arrived too late to 
benefit the fall crops. On the income side, first-half cash receipts 
from farm marketings are well below last year, but earlier 1975 farm 
income estimates will probably still have to be revised upward. Loan 
demand at Tenth District banks remains weak with the exception of 
consumer loans, while demand deposit growth is reported to be 
strong.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Data for the Tenth District on the value of construction contracts 
awarded and on the number of housing permits issued continue to 
depict a weak and struggling construction sector. While the current 
dollar value of all construction contracts awarded in the District 
rose from June to July, the increase was much less than in the same 
period in 1974. As a result, the value of Tenth District 
construction awards in July was more than 22 percent below the year-earlier level. On a month-to-month basis, nonresidential awards and 
awards for public works and utilities rose from June to July, while 
residential awards fell slightly. In comparison with July 1974, 
however, only nonresidential contracts increased slightly, as 
residential contracts declined and public works and utilities awards 
fell by more than one-half.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the Tenth District housing front, a leading indicator of future 
housing activity, the seasonally adjusted number of privately-owned 
housing permits issued, continued its decline in June after reaching 
a yearly peak in April 1975. Similarly, the number of permits issued 
for single-family units, a component of the total figure, also 
continued to decline from its April high. Despite these declines, 
however, both of these statistics were well above last June's level, 
when the number of permits issued fell precipitously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviews with Tenth District home builders provided significant 
insight into the interpretation of these data. Without exception, 
respondents who build houses costing above $45,000 reported a very 
strong year. One builder stated: "As far as I'm concerned, everyone 
must be busy now. We're as busy as we've ever been." Another 
reported starts 15-26 percent ahead of last year, while a third 
reported the best year in 3 years. For low priced home builders, 
however, the situation was quite different. Starts, in this case, 
were about the same as last year, very depressed. As one Home 
Builder Association spokesman noted: "We're building just for rich 
people."
      </p>
      <p>
       Expectations, on the other hand, were almost universally bleak. 
While virtually no respondent reported an inventory problem, a great 
fear was expressed of disintermediation from savings and loan 
associations, with the consequent high cost and unavailability of 
mortgage money, the price of which has already risen above 9 percent 
for conventional loans. This fear of disintermediation, due largely 
to competition from rising Treasury issue yields, was the principal 
factor mentioned as restricting the recovery of the housing 
industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little change has occurred in the District's agriculture over the 
last month. Several droughty areas have received rain in recent 
weeks, but for the most part, the fall crops will not benefit 
appreciably from this moisture due to its tardiness. However, the 
rains have improved pasture conditions and have provided good 
moisture for the fall seeding of the winter wheat crop, which will 
soon be underway.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first half of 1975, cash receipts from farm marketings in 
the District were 10.2 percent below the same period in 1974. This 
compares with an 8.1 percent fall nationally. However, given the 
developments in farm prices over the last five months, earlier 
estimates of net farm income for 1975 will almost certainly be 
revised upward. Interestingly, the sharp run-up in grain prices 
during July was partly responsible for a 13 percent drop in the 
placement of cattle in feedlots in seven major feeding states, the 
first such year-to-year decline since February. Should this trend 
continue, the supply of grain-fed animals will remain tight longer 
than previously expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District bankers contacted in a recent telephone survey 
indicated that except for consumer loans there were few signs of 
strengthened loan demand. Weekly Reporting Banks data for August 
showed a similar pattern in that the total volume of loans (other 
than Federal funds sold) fell more than seasonally during the month 
while consumer installment loans rose sharply. Surveyed bankers also 
indicated that they had stepped up their investments in securities 
in recent weeks to compensate for the continued weak loan demand. 
Deposit growth was reported to be stronger than seasonal in recent 
weeks, with a large increase in demand deposits partly offsetting a 
decline in time and savings deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers contacted in the survey were generally uncertain about the 
behavior of the prime rate and other interest rates between now and 
the end of the year. Some bankers thought interest rates were on a 
plateau and would remain so in the months ahead, while others 
thought interest rates would continue to rise.
