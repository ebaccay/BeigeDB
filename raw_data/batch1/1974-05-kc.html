       High interest rates are serving as a serious deterrent to home 
buyers while disintermediation is adversely affecting the supply of 
mortgage funds. No pickup in home-building in the second half of 
this year is expected either by District homebuilders or thrift 
institution executives, should current conditions continue. The 
agricultural outlook still includes big crop yields, based on May 1 
conditions, but farm income prospects are wilting. The rate of 
increase of business loan demand appears to be slowing down, 
although loanable funds have become increasingly tight. Bank credit 
is being rationed, while banks aggressively compete for loanable 
funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       From discussions with several District thrift institutions, concern 
over disintermediation was readily apparent. Net inflows have shrunk 
appreciably or have given way to net outflows of deposits. One 
savings and loan executive said that April was "miserable," and the 
"Treasury issues are killing them." Another described deposit 
inflows as "slim and bad." He wants the Board to know that the law 
of supply and demand still works-that people are withdrawing large 
CD's before maturity because they can make up the penalty and then 
some. A third "...sure would like to know what the Fed is planning 
to do to him next." A respondent who had recently attended a 
mortgage bankers convention said "everyone there seemed scared and 
uncertain."
      </p>
      <p>
       With a few exceptions, homebuilders generally sound just as gloomy 
as S&amp;L executives about the outlook. Although most expected the year 
to be slower, pessimism about the months ahead is increasing. While 
new home sales in the Kansas City metropolitan area held up 
surprisingly well through mid-April, they have dropped off 
drastically since, especially in Missouri because of its 8 percent 
ceiling on mortgages. Two major Kansas City builders expressed 
resentment at the apparent willingness of the Federal Reserve System 
to sacrifice the housing industry this year in an effort to stop 
inflation. In Colorado, building activity continues to be determined 
largely by natural gas allocations. Thus, Denver experienced a 
record number of mortgage commitments in April, a bulge created by 
the gas company's requirement that, in order to get gas service, new 
units must be completed by July. A sharp decline in new starts is 
expected once that deadline is passed. In Tulsa, a builder 
complained about how high interest rates were hurting housing. "You 
know," he said, "we had some carpenters looking for jobs recently. 
Now, that's a change." One hundred miles away, in Oklahoma City, 
however, the construction of single family homes is off only 
slightly from last year, and the builder contacted remains 
optimistic about the months ahead. However, such favorable views 
were decidedly fewer in this Redbook survey than in the one taken 
three months ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agricultural conditions in the District continue mixed. Favorable 
weather has enabled farmers to make good headway with the planting 
of spring crops. Some difficulty in acquiring fertilizer and 
chemical pesticides is being reported, but the problem does not 
appear to be too serious in this geographic area. Winter wheat 
conditions have deteriorated substantially in much of the District 
since May 1 when favorable prospects were indicated in the crop 
report. Dry weather and an outbreak of streak mosaic are hindering 
the development of the crop. With immediate improvement in the 
weather, the 1974 wheat crop still could be larger than a year ago. 
The sharp decline in wheat prices over the last 2 months has removed 
much of the bloom surrounding income prospects for District farmers, 
but unless weather conditions improve, the price situation may 
reverse. Moreover, the livestock industry, which continues in a 
depressed state, offers little promise of bolstering District farm 
income unless slaughter prices improve or costs come down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although business borrowing at large District banks increased 
sharply in the past 4 weeks, reports from a survey of some of the 
larger banks indicate that recent increases in the prime rate are 
beginning to have an effect on business loan demand. Several banks 
reported that, while the volume of business borrowing remains 
exceptionally large, loan requests do appear to be leveling off or, 
in a few cases, even declining. Nevertheless, due to the current 
high level of business loan demand, some banks have begun to ration 
credit either by rejecting new loan requests or by limiting the size 
of loans to normal or past amounts. Moreover, in several instances, 
banks have become more selective with regard to the purposes of loan 
requests and have rejected speculative loans for land development 
and "excessive" inventory accumulation. To accommodate the business 
loan demand, District banks are competing aggressively for CD's and, 
as a result, are experiencing sharp inflows of deposits. Most banks 
are also relying upon purchases of Federal funds to supplement 
loanable funds, but of the banks in the survey, none as of yet have 
borrowed Euro-dollars. With only two exceptions, the survey banks 
have not experienced any slowing in the growth of savings deposits 
or consumer certificates of deposit in recent weeks. One of the 
exceptions, however, did report a drop of 5 percent in savings 
deposits and consumer CD's in the last month.
