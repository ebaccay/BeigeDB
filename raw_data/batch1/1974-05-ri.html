       Results of our most recent survey of businessmen suggest some 
softening of recent strong demand pressures in the Fifth District. 
Reports from manufacturers indicate some easing in the pace of new 
orders and perhaps also of inventory accumulation. The retail sales 
diffusion index for the District suggests little change in sales, 
which is a substantial shift from the sizable and general increases 
recorded in previous surveys. Reports from retailers suggests that 
sales of
       <br/>
       big-ticket items are less buoyant than was the case earlier 
in the year. Bankers continue to experience heavy demand for 
business and agricultural loans and, given the high cost of CD 
funds, many have begun to screen loan applications more carefully. 
Some banking respondents express serious concern over what they 
consider to be groundless rumors that banks will be unable to roll 
over their CD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       The survey results from 56 manufacturers showed new orders down in 
17, and up in only 6, which is a significantly worse diffusion than 
shown in earlier surveys this year. Until recently, manufacturers 
had been reporting that inventories were lower than desired. The 
recent survey, however, shows that although 15 respondents believed 
that inventories were too low, an equal number believed they were 
too high. In spite of an apparent softening in orders, an increasing 
number of respondents thought that their current plant and equipment 
capacity was too low. This suggests that they do not expect a 
continuation of whatever softening of demand may be occurring. This 
conclusion is also supported by the responses on production 
expectations. Twenty-one expect production to expand in the next few 
months, and only 6 respondents expect production to decline.
      </p>
      <p>
       The easing of new orders appears to be concentrated in textiles, 
apparel, furniture, electrical equipment and supplies, and lumber 
and wood products. Sales of textile producers may have been 
adversely affected by the inability of textile converters to find 
financing. Primary and fabricated metals producers, however, appear 
to have burgeoning orders, as do food processors. Employment in 
manufacturing firms is reported unchanged from last month, and most 
firms continue to entertain buoyant expectations for future 
production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our retail sales survey indicates that sales may be leveling from 
their previously high rates of growth. Big-ticket items, especially, 
seem to be selling somewhat less well than they did in March or 
April. Sales expectations for the next six months, however, appear 
to have improved since last month's survey.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agricultural outlook for the District remains generally 
optimistic, with most crops coming in on time or ahead of time. Some 
soft spots may be developing in livestock production, however, 
because of declining prices and high costs. Because of low market 
prices and high production costs, some North Carolina turkey 
producers are reported to be selling their breeder flocks and 
destroying eggs. While cash receipts of District farmers have been 
rising, the increase has lagged behind that for farmers in the 
nation as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
       District bankers continue to report heavy loan demands, with 
strength centered chiefly in business and agricultural loans. 
Fertilizer dealers and other farm suppliers are reported to be 
reluctant to extend trade credit to farmers and as a result farm 
credit is apparently being pushed increasingly into the banking 
system. Heavy inventory financing is reported as the principal 
factor behind business loan demand. Bankers attribute most of the 
recent increase in inventory borrowing to higher prices rather than 
to expanded stocks. Several large banks reported that they are no 
longer making real estate loans and are limiting consumer loan 
growth to what can be financed by increases in consumer time and 
savings deposits. Bankers generally show a reluctance to go to the 
CD market to raise funds at the current high rates and some indicate 
that they will accommodate only as much loan demand as can be 
financed through "regular" deposit growth. Most bank respondents 
appear to have tightened up their lending practices rather 
substantially. Consumer loan delinquencies, which have risen 
nationally, appear to pose no major problem in this District, 
according to most respondents. Several respondents were quite 
exercised over news stories of diminished public confidence in banks 
and mentioned the dangers of "groundless rumors" that many banks 
will not be able to roll over their CD's.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage funds have become scarce indeed, as District savings and 
loan associations are experiencing sizable deposit outflows. 
Preliminary data indicate the April outflow may have been as much as 
$100 million. This compares with a $200 million inflow in April 
1973. Residential building and the building supplies industry are 
feeling the crunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Businessmen and bankers in the District continue to express optimism 
regarding the six months outlook for business in their local 
markets. But most feel that the national economy will show little 
growth over this period.
