      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 19, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity around the Nation is maintaining its forward 
momentum according to reports from the twelve Districts. And, the 
outlook for 1973 ranges from optimistic in several Districts to 
"almost universally ebullient" in the Seventh District. Orders, 
inventories, and shipments of manufacturers were reported on the 
rise, and manufacturing employment is expanding. Retail sales are 
strong, and the 1972 Christmas season is expected to result in sales 
well above the 1971 level. Construction activity has generally 
remained at high levels or expanded further, but signs of weakness 
in construction were noted by several Districts. With the economy 
continuing to expand, shortages of labor and materials were noted as 
emerging problems. Wet weather has curtailed the harvest of several 
crops and inflicted some losses, but the overall farm income 
situation remains favorable. Loan demand continues strong at banks, 
but trends in deposits have varied significantly between Districts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity was reported on a noticeable upswing 
according to survey results reported by the Cleveland, Richmond, and 
Minneapolis banks. Steel shipments were cited as especially strong 
in the Cleveland report, and steel economists predicted a record 
year for steel shipments in 1973. Chicago noted that auto and truck 
production was at high levels and further gains were expected in 
1973. However, in the Philadelphia District, manufacturers reported 
a lull in their December orders while maintaining an optimistic view 
about the next six-month period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The increase in business activity continues to generate expectations 
of higher levels of capital spending. Several directors of the 
Boston bank anticipated large increases in capital spending in 1973 
because of the approach of production to capacity levels. Atlanta 
reported that the construction of numerous small plants had been 
announced recently in the Southeast, and Chicago indicated that auto 
makers were accelerating their capital spending plans. However, St. 
Louis reported complaints from businessmen in their District that 
profit margins were not sufficient in some industries to stimulate 
plant and equipment spending even though utilization rates were near 
capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although construction activity is still characterized as strong in 
most Districts, there is growing concern about possible overbuilding 
of multi-family residential units. Cleveland, Boston, New York, San 
Francisco, and Minneapolis all indicated that apartment and/or 
condominium construction may be excessive in parts of their 
Districts. Although several Districts suggested the possibility of a 
decline in housing activity in 1973, the extent of the possible 
decline was not large. Builders in the St. Louis District were 
reported to be optimistic about further gains in construction in 
1973, including an increase in single-family housing for the St. 
Louis metropolitan area. Atlanta reported numerous large-scale 
construction projectsâ€”both residential and nonresidentialâ€”in the 
Southeast, especially in Atlanta and in central Florida.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales are rising and the outlook for the months ahead is 
favorable. All of the Districts commenting on retail trade indicate 
that 1972 Christmas sales should be well ahead of last year. San 
Francisco and Chicago noted that luxury and "big ticket" items were 
selling well. And Kansas City reported that the strong auto sales 
included many of the more expensive models or models with large 
amounts of optional equipment. Although reporting retail sales as 
generally good, Minneapolis indicated that sales of winter 
recreational vehicles had not been up to the earlier expectations of 
one manufacturer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment is expanding in most areas and declines in unemployment 
were mentioned by several Districts. Dallas reported a record level 
of employment in the Eleventh District states in October as a result 
of widespread gains. In the Third District, Philadelphia noted that 
the unemployment rate had fallen from 5.7 to 4.5 percent in the last 
three months. Atlanta indicated that unemployment rates in several 
southeastern states were at their lowest levels in years. With the 
gains in employment, some signs of labor shortages were reported by 
the Atlanta, St. Louis, Richmond, and Chicago Districts. And Chicago 
noted that turnover rates and absenteeism were rising at firms in 
the Seventh District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The generally favorable agricultural situation has been set back 
somewhat by wet weather in the Midwest, Southeast, and Southwest 
that delayed the soybean, sorghum, and cotton harvests. Kansas City 
indicates that the production of soybeans and sorghum will fall 
below the November crop report estimate, and Atlanta cited a loss of 
30 million bushels of soybeans in Tennessee. The extent of the 
losses in the Chicago District was uncertain, but it was noted that 
the overall farm outlook was still the most favorable in many years. 
Dallas reports that the cotton yield continues to look good, but the 
delay in harvesting may hurt the quality of the crop. While the wet 
weather hurt production in most areas, Florida citrus and vegetable 
growers were aided by the moisture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand was reported to be generally strong by Dallas, Kansas 
City, and Richmond. Consumer installment loans and mortgage loans 
were mentioned as areas of strength by bankers in the Cleveland and 
Philadelphia Districts. The trend of bank deposits varied 
considerably among the Districts. Cleveland reported a strong rise 
in deposits while Kansas City and Philadelphia indicated that 
deposits were largely unchanged. Bankers in the Kansas City District 
are trying to attract additional deposits by offering higher rates 
on CD's than currently prevail in the New York market. Banks are 
apparently not experiencing a shortage of funds, and Cleveland 
reports that most banks in the Fourth District are highly liquid.
