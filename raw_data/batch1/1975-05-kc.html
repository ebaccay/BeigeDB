      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <strong>
       May 14, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in the Tenth District have shown some improvement in 
  recent weeks. Inventories are still being worked down, but seem to 
  be close to desired levels. Moderately increasing retail sales are 
  expected for the rest of this year. New car sales continue to be 
  weak. An increase in prices received by farmers, after five months 
  of decline, is likely to put upward pressure on food prices in the 
  next few months. Loan demand at Tenth District commercial banks 
  continues generally soft, although business loan demand has shown 
  moderate improvement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in major metropolitan areas of the Tenth District have 
  shown some improvement in recent weeks. Consumers are still shopping 
  carefully for bargains, and much of the improvement is attributed to 
  special sales and other promotional activity by sellers. Durable 
  goods sales are not yet showing much general gain, although there 
  are some reports of strengthening sales of furniture.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers see the impact of the tax rebate as primarily a 
  confidence-booster for consumers. They do not expect much direct 
  impact because of the relatively small size of the individual 
  rebates. However, the majority of respondents apparently believe 
  that the psychological effect of the tax cut package will have a 
  positive influence of their sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although some department stores are still working down their 
  inventories, most respondents believe their stocks to be about in 
  balance with current sales. With inventories now near desired 
  levels, several retailers reported plans for "slow" or "gradual" 
  increases in stocks during the rest of the year. Such plans seem to 
  be in keeping with expectations of increasing sales—variously 
  described as "a slow but steady increase"; "a normal rate of 
  expansion" following a real turnaround by the third quarter; "very 
  optimistic for fall"; and "a moderate expansion expected," but not 
  overly optimistic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District automobile dealers are apparently sharing in the weak 
  performance of the industry nationally. Most reported their business 
  stimulated by the rebate program, beyond those particular models on 
  which rebates were paid, as a result of increased showroom traffic. 
  Weaker sales after the rebate period ended also extended over a 
  wider segment of the market. Inventory situations vary by dealership 
  and by make of car—some are adding to inventories, a few are still 
  overstocked in particular models, others are in a satisfactory 
  position but are keeping a close eye on their stocks. Uncertainty 
  and lack of confidence on the part of consumers is a theme in most 
  of the discussions; not knowing what to expect in the way of 
  gasoline prices and availability, government anti-pollution and 
  safety requirements, the possible return of rebate programs, etc. 
  Potential buyers are clearly acting in a way that underlines the 
"postpone-ability" of new automobile purchases. At the same time, 
  used car sales are strong and prices relatively high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Auto dealers expect no direct help from the tax rebate program. 
  Customers at the majority of dealerships appear very interested in 
  fuel economy as well as in the price of the car. However, there is 
  no clear-cut evidence of movement to, or away from, a particular 
  size of car.
     </p>
     <p>
      A substantial increase in cattle and hog prices during the month 
  ended April 15 reversed the five-month skid in prices received by 
  farmers. Although farm prices as a whole rose 4 percent last month, 
  they were still 8 percent below the year-earlier average. 
  Nevertheless, this turnaround in prices—while gratifying to 
  livestock producers—will likely keep pressure on food prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent strength in slaughter steer prices could signal a revival of 
  the cattle feeding business. The number of cattle on feed as of 
  April 1 was the lowest for that date since 1963, but March 
  placements in the seven major feeding states were 20 percent above 
  the previous year. Carryover stocks of wheat and feed grains at the 
  end of the marketing year will be quite low by historic standards, 
  but no shortages are foreseen. Although the export market for wheat 
  and corn has softened, domestic prices should remain firm in view of 
  the tight old-crop supply situation. Production prospects for 1975 
  indicate a record 2 billion bushel wheat crop is possible, and with 
  a normal growing season feed grain production will likely achieve a 
  new high. Thus, grain prices could weaken below current levels 
  during the second half of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand at Tenth District banks was generally soft over the last 
  month. Agricultural, consumer, and, especially, bank card credit 
  loans continued soft in all areas of the district. However, business 
  loan demand showed moderate improvement, and some respondents in 
  Kansas City and in Denver believe they detected an increase in 
  interest in real estate and housing loan demand. One area of the 
  Tenth District that seems especially hard pressed is Albuquerque, 
  where loan demand for most categories of loans is reported to be 
  down considerably.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand deposits have increased moderately, while time and savings 
  deposits have fallen slightly. CDs in some areas of the district 
  were running off, although Oklahoma City and Kansas City, where 
  rates on some maturities were higher than in the rest of the 
  district, reported CDs as being stable. Most CD rates tended to be 
  just below the prime rate charged by the banks. Some respondents 
  also expected the CD rate to decline an additional one-half percent.
