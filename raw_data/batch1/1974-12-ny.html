      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 11, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The views expressed by Second District directors and other business 
leaders who were contacted recently in general reflected the 
nationwide slowdown in business activity. Department store sales 
have been relatively sluggish for this time of year. Business 
inventory policies have become significantly more cautious, with 
some instances of outright liquidation reported. Shortages of goods 
and materials have reportedly eased substantially. Despite the rise 
in overall unemployment, however, shortages of skilled workers 
persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding consumer spending, the Buffalo Branch directors on balance 
felt that the sharp decline in auto sales had not been paralleled in 
their area by a similar fall in the sale of other major consumer 
items. Nevertheless, these directors generally agreed that retail 
sales of nonautomotive durable goods had weakened. Among other 
respondents, the president of a high quality New York City 
department store reported that his firm's sales had declined in 
November, which is usually a good month, and while he expected some 
improvement in December, he looked for Christmas sales to be only a 
little better than last year in dollar terms. Similar sentiments 
were expressed by a senior official of a large New York City 
department store with branches in the suburbs, who also expressed 
concern over the retail sales outlook over the coming months. 
Similarly, a survey of New York City department stores by a local 
newspaper revealed that November sales at many of these stores had 
undergone their worst year-to-year decline in four years. Business, 
however, has apparently picked up with the advent of the Christmas 
season, with observers reporting heavy crowds and good business. As 
noted by several respondents, however, it appears to be a "bargain 
hunters' market," with heavy promotion and with many stores holding 
at this time the usual post-Christmas clearance sales, of both soft 
and hard goods. Similarly, many supermarkets have been holding 
special sales, and running advertisements offering discount coupons 
for selected items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Against the background of relatively weak consumer demand, there 
were indications of a re-evaluation of inventory policies. The 
Buffalo Branch directors thus agreed that both retail and 
manufacturing firms have been attempting to adjust inventory 
positions downward, not only because of the weak retail sales 
picture, but also because of the easing of commodity prices and the 
high cost of financing inventories. The senior official of a large 
Buffalo department store reported that his firm had reduced its "on-hand" inventory and future commitments of apparel about 20 per cent 
below last year's level, a move he felt was not unusual for the 
retail trade industry. Similarly, the two New York City retailers 
mentioned above reported that their firms were attempting to 
maintain a "lean" inventory position. A senior official of a 
nationwide metal processing firm reported his firm was no longer 
able to sell all it produced, a development he felt indicated that 
the firm's customers were drawing down on their existing 
inventories. The chairman of a conglomerate stated his firm was 
liquidating inventories, and would continue to do so. It was noted, 
however, that while inventories might be too high in some sectors, a 
number of items such as heavy machinery, electrical equipment and 
metal casing still required long order lead times.
      </p>
      <p>
       District construction activity, particularly in the New York City 
area, remains at a low ebb, although the outlook has brightened 
somewhat over the past month. A survey by a trade association 
indicates that New York state savings banks experienced moderate net 
deposits inflows in November following seven consecutive months of 
net outflows. Several thrift institution officials in New York have 
suggested, however, that these funds would not flow immediately into 
the mortgage market but would be used initially to rebuild liquidity 
positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nationwide advance in the unemployment rate was reflected in the 
reports of several respondents. Thus, the two New York City 
retailers mentioned above stated their firms were attempting to trim 
personnel as well as other costs, and the chairman of the 
conglomerate reported his firm was cutting down its sales force. The 
Buffalo directors, however, felt that with the exception of layoffs 
in the automotive industry, employment in general appeared to be 
holding up well in the upstate New York region and that the supply 
of skilled labor remained tight. In their views, there appeared to 
be no evidence as yet of major layoffs of managerial and 
professional employees. The directors were, however, concerned that 
if the economy continues to decline, layoffs in the managerial and 
professional ranks may well occur.
