     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Capacity bottlenecks are not currently a major problem in the Ninth 
  District economy; and in general, capacity problems are not expected 
  to arise in 1976, though there are exceptions. In most industries, 
  there is still excess capacity. In other industries, such as coal 
  and taconite, firms are responding to demand pressures by adding to 
  capacity. Lead times for some products such as brass and steel 
  continue to lengthen, but these longer lead times are not seen as 
  evidence of capacity bottlenecks. Industrial raw materials prices 
  are up, but the increases have been modest. Gasoline prices have 
  also increased, but supplies are ample. Overall energy supplies 
  appear adequate for the rest of 1976. Drought conditions in the 
  District have worsened in the last month; some farming regions are 
  now in critical need of rainfall, and farm prices are rising.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is more evidence of underutilized capacity than of supply 
  bottlenecks in the Ninth District economy. A copper plant in upper 
  Michigan is now running at 50 percent of capacity and is expected to 
  be at 75 percent of capacity by year's end. A paper mill in the same 
  area has recently expanded its plant and is operating below its new 
  capacity. A representative from a major food processing concern says 
  he is unaware of any capacity problems in this region s key 
  industries. A director from a major manufacturing firm which buys 
  inputs from national markets says that his firm's operations have 
  not been hindered by capacity problems among suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only about 1 in 7 of the 175 firms responding to this Bank's May 
  survey of District manufacturers says that existing plant and 
  equipment is inadequate in light of current backlogs and prospective 
  sales over the next year. Nearly half of those firms are in food 
  processing; for several of the firms, capital outlays would be used 
  to update and improve existing facilities rather than to increase 
  capacity. In the paper industry, considered by some to be a likely 
  bottleneck in the coming month, most survey respondents say that 
  capacity is adequate to meet anticipated sales over the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing agents report only scattered problems in obtaining 
  inputs. One exception is that electronic firms say integrated 
  circuits are currently in short supply; suppliers reportedly have a 
  90-day backlog of orders, and only orders from preferred accounts 
  are being accepted. Capacity of circuit suppliers is reportedly 
  being expanded, but the increased supply will not come on line in 
  the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another exception is a manufacturer of steel castings who says that 
  heavy demand from the District's expanding taconite industry is 
  pressing on his firm's supply capabilities. Smaller orders are not 
  being accepted, and the firm is taking on only those customers who 
  show promise of developing into major accounts. The firm is 
  considering construction of a new foundry, which would come on line 
  in 1979. The foundry would be constructed in Duluth or northern 
  Wisconsin, and its primary purpose would be to meet the rising needs 
  of the taconite industry on the Minnesota iron range.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except for integrated circuits and castings, most inputs are in 
  adequate supply. A manufacturer of heavy construction equipment says 
  that lead times are lengthening. But he feels that the longer leads 
  are due to the low inventories being held by suppliers rather than 
  to limits on productive capacity. A producer of paper products says 
  that his firm has integrated vertically to guard against a 
  recurrence of the supply problems of 1973 and 1974; he sees no 
  supply problems developing for his firm over the near term.
     </p>
     <p>
      Productive capacity is growing in the region's primary industries. 
  Capital inputs in the farm sector have been substantially upgraded 
  in recent years. Coal production is also increasing. Finally, six 
  taconite projects now under way on the iron range will boost 
  capacity 60 percent by 1979. Two of those projects should be in 
  operation by the end of 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices of industrial raw materials have edged upward in recent 
  weeks, but the increases have not been sharp, and directors expect 
  that any increases over the summer months will be moderate. In the 
  farm sector, prices of feed inputs have also been rising; one 
  director, for instance, says that soybean meal prices in his area 
  are up substantially since April.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gasoline prices in the region are up, with the increases generally 
  ranging from one cent to three cents per gallon. Nonetheless, 
  gasoline remains in ample supply, as do all petroleum products. The 
  purchasing agent of a major regional corporation says that there are 
  currently gluts of heavy fuel oil and, consequently, considerable 
  price cutting. Overall energy supplies in the region are seen as 
  adequate into 1977, unless the coming winter is unexpectedly harsh.
     </p>
     <p>
      The crop situation in the District has worsened since the last Red 
  Book report. Normal crop yields are now very unlikely in Minnesota. 
  Corn and soybeans are making some progress but remain under great 
  stress, and a shortfall in hay production has sent livestock 
  producers scrambling for existing supplies. In addition, drought 
  conditions have spread westward in the District and large areas of 
  the Dakotas are now in need of additional rain. The anticipated 
  shortfall in production can be expected to have the greatest impact 
  on prices of barley, oats, flax, and durum wheat, products for which 
  this area is the major supplier.
