      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Strong inflows of funds to Tenth District savings and loan 
  institutions have continued, and mortgage lending activities have 
  increased. Similar reports of strength in deposit inflows at 
  commercial banks for both time and demand deposits were received in 
  response to inquiries made of a number of Tenth District banks. 
  Although overall loan demand continues to be sluggish, retail sales 
  are apparently continuing the improvement which was reported in the 
  May Redbook, and businessmen are expressing increased—if at times 
  guarded—optimism over future economic prospects. With the stage set 
  for a bumper wheat crop in 1975, farmers now voice concern over the 
  depressing effect which such a crop might have on wheat prices. 
  Despite increases in the index of prices received by farmers in both 
  April and May, district farmers still expect a sizable decline in 
  net farm income over that received last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although a few of the S&amp;Ls contacted reported small or moderate 
  deposit inflows, such terms as "extremely good," "substantial," 
"very large," and "markedly up" were more often used by respondents 
  to describe their deposit gains. Little enthusiasm was voiced over 
  Treasury Secretary Simon's request to allow higher interest rates to 
  be paid on savings bonds because of the likely competitive impact 
  for their institutions. Apparently, tax rebate checks have not as 
  yet been a significant element in overall deposit inflows, since 
  most of the institutions contacted reported little evidence to the 
  contrary. The strength in deposits has permitted S&amp;Ls to increase 
  their mortgage lending activities significantly, while at the same 
  time enabling them to greatly improve their balance sheets by paying 
  off their loans. Their liquidity positions, with few exceptions, are 
  reported as substantially improved. Mortgage rates are generally 
  expected to remain fairly stable over the next six months, and the 
  attitudes of their business customers suggest that they are becoming 
  somewhat more optimistic about future business prospects, although 
  such optimism was not without some reservation. In part, their 
  improved view of the future is traceable to continuing growth in 
  retail sales in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The stage is set for a bumper wheat crop in 1975. Current estimates 
  are that more than 1.6 billion bushels of winter wheat will be 
  produced this year. The wheat condition is described as excellent 
  throughout the central parts of Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma 
  following widespread rains during the past two weeks. Some hail 
  damage occurred, but destruction was limited to isolated fields 
  along a narrow band. Western portions of Nebraska and Kansas have 
  recovered from a very dry winter and early spring, but the Oklahoma 
  Panhandle remains very dry and will produce little dryland wheat 
  this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farmers are concerned about the depressing effect a large crop might 
  have on wheat prices, since cash receipts from farm marketings have 
  fallen sharply from year-ago levels. During the first quarter of the 
  year, cash receipts nationally were 17 percent below the first three 
  months of 1974. In Tenth District states, first quarter cash 
  receipts fell 27 percent below the same period last year due to 
  lower prices for both crops and livestock. The index of prices 
  received by farmers increased in both April and May, but net farm 
  income is still expected to fall about 20 percent below last year's 
  $27.2 billion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers contacted in the Tenth District generally reported continued 
  sluggishness in overall loan demand. Loans to farmers have displayed 
  greater than seasonal weakness, while commercial and industrial 
  loans still remain soft. Some of the bankers contacted, however, 
  anticipated an improvement in the demand for loans in the near 
  future. They noted that their customers were optimistic and that 
  preliminary reports indicated retail sales volume in their local 
  areas has risen in the last 30 days. Some bankers also reported that 
  consumer loans for automobiles were up slightly and that recreation 
  and tourist-related business in the western part of the Tenth 
  District was experiencing strong demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit inflows at surveyed banks were reported to be quite strong 
  recently. Both demand and time deposits have showed greater than 
  seasonal strength during the month of May. Most bankers contacted 
  indicated they thought that the tax rebates had no significant 
  effect on their demand or time deposit inflows. In view of the 
  current strength in deposits and the lack of a vigorous upturn in 
  loan demand, virtually all bankers contacted said their prime rates 
  would probably drop slightly over the next few months.
