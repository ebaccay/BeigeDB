     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent evidence indicates further weakening in District business 
  activity. Unemployment rose sharply in January, and manufacturers 
  are not so optimistic as they were last November. Nevertheless, bank 
  directors cited several sectors where business activity has 
  improved. In addition, directors report that District businesses 
  have not been confronted with overly excessive inventories; 
  inflationary pressures have also eased. The District's rural areas 
  continue to be relatively unaffected by the recession.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment continues to rise. The District's unemployment rate, 
  seasonally adjusted, increased from 5.9 percent to 6.4 percent 
  between December and January, with the Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
  rate jumping from 5.1 percent to 6.2 percent. In early 1975, 
  District help-wanted advertising was down 30 percent from a year ago 
  and initial claims for unemployment insurance were up 35 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers are not so optimistic about their sales 
  outlook as they were last November. After increasing 15.9 percent 
  from a year earlier in the fourth quarter, District manufacturers 
  look for their sales to surpass year-ago levels by around 9 percent 
  during the first nine months of this year. (Last November 
  respondents had anticipated a 14 percent sales gain during the first 
  half of 1974.) Both durables and nondurables producers revised 
  downward their sales expectations, with price increases probably 
  accounting for most, if not all, of the anticipated sales gains. 
  Recent declines in District manufacturing employment also denote a 
  weakening in manufacturing activity. There are, however, some areas 
  of strength. Twin Cities producers of medical equipment and 
  peripheral electronic data processing equipment are enjoying strong 
  sales. Small local machine shops are also doing quite well from both 
  a volume and profit standpoint.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although District business activity has continued to weaken, some 
  District industries have recently shown improvement. Several 
  directors commented that the automobile rebates have had a favorable 
  effect upon sales. The substantial inflows of savings to thrift 
  institutions have made more mortgage money available, and one large 
  Minneapolis-St. Paul area savings and loan association has begun to 
  advertise the availability of funds. In addition, the observation 
  was made that lower interest rates have benefited finance companies, 
  the securities industry, banks and utilities. A director associated 
  with the retail trade industry indicated that his firm's sales 
  improved in February but cautioned that it was too early to 
  ascertain whether a definite pickup in consumer spending has 
  occurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area 
  indicated that business has held up quite well in their areas. Two 
  directors from the Dakotas described business in that region as 
  normal for this time of year. A Montana director stated that his 
  area's businessmen are more optimistic than earlier this winter and 
  reported that his area's retail sales have held up quite well. A 
  director from the upper peninsula of Michigan, however, indicated 
  that business has been off in his area's copper and paper 
  industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors indicated that no excessive amount of unwanted inventory 
  accumulation has occurred in the District. Many local and regional 
  companies in the Twin Cities area are holding inventories above 
  desired levels. The situation, however, does not call for any forced 
  liquidation of inventories. Most managers are of the opinion that, 
  with a modest reduction in their rates of output, the desired level 
  and balance of inventories can be achieved by midyear or earlier. 
  Another report indicated that the inventory situation in the retail 
  trade industry has improved. Directors from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area generally agreed that excess inventories 
  are not a problem. However, two directors reported a weakening in 
  farm machinery sales and a recent buildup in inventories. Also, the 
  District's livestock industry is burdened with an excessive supply 
  of cattle; one director felt that the District's livestock industry 
  would not recover until 1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bank directors were unanimous in expressing the opinion that 
  inflationary pressures have or will be easing. One director, for 
  example, indicated that his firm's budgeted price increases for 1975 
  were only half as large as price increases experienced in 1974. Many 
  directors cited examples of price reductions in their area or 
  industry. One report indicated that list prices are not being cut 
  because of some fear that there will be a return of wage and price 
  controls. However, transaction prices are declining as businessmen 
  provide special incentives or volume discounts.
