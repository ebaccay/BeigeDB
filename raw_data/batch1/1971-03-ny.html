      Beige Book Report: New York

       March 9, 1971
      </strong>

      <p>
       The overall impression of the economic outlook that emerged from 
opinions expressed by Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York and of the Buffalo Branch and by other business leaders 
continued to be one of uncertainty, with little indication that a 
strong recovery is in the offing. Sentiments were mixed regarding 
consumer spending. It was generally agreed that no significant 
pickup in plant and equipment outlays was likely over the coming 
months. A strike in the steel industry was widely expected and 
evidence of stockpiling was mounting. Business loan demand was 
reported to be holding up well in Western New York (Buffalo), but to 
be relatively weak in the New York City area. As in previous months, 
concern over inflation was evident with several respondents calling 
for more direct government action in this area.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to retail sales, the treasurer of a large chain of 
department stores reported that business over the Christmas season 
and during the January sales had been "reasonably good," but that 
sales in February had been sluggish and that his firm was budgeting 
for only a gradual increase over the coming months. The vice 
president of a large photographic equipment firm stated that his 
company saw evidence of a lack of strength in consumer spending in 
the fact that retailers seemed to be living off their inventories. 
The chairman of the board of a large New York City bank stated that 
consumer spending has not "blossomed" as might have been expected, 
while the president of a large finance company felt that, on the 
basis of consumer loans extended by his firm, the consumer is still 
"hanging on to his dollars."
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the executive vice president of a large New York 
City department store, with branches in the suburbs, reported that 
business had been excellent from the week before Christmas through 
the third week of February (10 to 15 percent above last year), 
although it subsequently slowed; he looked for "good solid" business 
in the months ahead, but expected that "hard work" in the form of 
promotional sales and good values would be required. Similarly, the 
president of a Rochester department store reported that sales—notably promotional sales—were better than last year. Finally, 
several other respondents felt that retail business was good, and 
the president of a chain of variety stores was very optimistic with 
respect to 1971 sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to outlays for plant and equipment, respondents 
expressing an opinion on the subject generally saw no strengthening 
in such outlays as compared to a month ago, i.e., 1971 outlays would 
probably remain at about 1970 levels. In this context, the 
respondents did not feel that liberalization of depreciation 
allowances would result in a significant upgrading of capital 
spending plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several bankers and other business leaders looked for an increase in 
inventory investment in the form of strike-hedging stockpiling of 
steel. A strike in the steel industry appeared to be widely 
expected, although opinions differed as to its probable length.
      </p>
      <p>
       One director felt it would be short-lived, with the settlement in 
the automobile industry setting the pattern for the steel 
settlements. Others felt it would be longer, with this expectation 
showing up in inventory policies. Thus, two directors of the Buffalo 
Branch, who are associated with firms using large quantities of 
steel, reported their firms planned to have a 90-day supply on hand 
by August 1, as against normal inventories for about 30 days, while 
the large photographic concern looked for a long strike and plans to 
build its steel inventories to six to eight weeks above normal 
levels. In addition, several bankers reported making arrangements to 
finance a substantial buildup in steel inventories. Another 
director, the president of a large manufacturing concern, felt there 
would be a long strike if the economy is strong, "but none if it 
goes down."
      </p>
      <p>
       Views regarding the demand for business loans at commercial banks 
varied according to locality. The Buffalo Branch banker directors 
reported that loan demand at their banks was holding up well. The 
chairman of a large New York City bank, on the other hand, saw the 
loan picture as weaker than a year ago. The chairman of another, 
smaller, New York City bank characterized loan demand as "sluggish" 
and reported that his bank had not experienced any increase in 
demand following the prime rate cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in previous months, deep concern was expressed over inflation. A 
director characterized the recent government action in the 
construction industry as a step in the right direction. Several 
other business leaders, however, felt the need for stronger direct 
government action on the wage and price front. One business leader 
felt that, with the 1972 election ahead, the President was caught 
between "fire and drowning" and would probably make concessions in 
the fight against inflation to reduce unemployment.
