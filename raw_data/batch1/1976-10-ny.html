      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The continuing improvement in economic conditions in the Second 
  District appears to have been sustained in the face of the apparent 
  slowing in the pace of the nationwide recovery, judging from 
  comments of directors and other business leaders who were contacted 
  recently. The strengthening in retail sales in New York City has 
  carried into early October and appears to have spread into other 
  parts of the region. While capital spending continued to lag, there 
  are scattered reports of a pickup. The rate of joblessness in the 
  region appears to have stabilized and the gap between the regional 
  and national unemployment rates has narrowed. On the outlook for 
  prices, respondents generally felt that inflation was moderating 
  gradually and that the recent resistance to attempted price 
  increases would help temper the future inflation. Nonetheless, many 
  remained concerned over the prospects of mounting cost pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in New York City appears to have retained its new-found strength. While for most of the year, New York City 
  merchandising has been a weak spot for many national retail chains, 
  that situation seems to have changed in recent months. The vice 
  president of a national department store chain reported that the 
  increase in September sales for New York exceeded that chain-wide 
  average and that, while sales in the rest of the country showed 
  signs of a weakening in early October, sales in New York City 
  remained strong. According to a City department store executive, 
  sales were strong in September and were better than expected in 
  early October. The pickup in consumer buying appears to have spread 
  outside of New York City as well. The directors of the Buffalo 
  Branch detected a modest improvement in department store sales in 
  September. Part of this impetus in the recovery in consumer buying 
  may have been due to growing acceptance of Sunday openings. The head 
  of a large department store chain in the Buffalo area noted a marked 
  improvement in sales of the final weeks of September, which he 
  attributed to the success of recent Sunday openings. He expects 
  Sunday openings to become a way of life in the Buffalo area. In New 
  Jersey, a trade association official noted that, although new car 
  sales continued to be more sluggish than nationwide, automobile 
  dealers were generally optimistic about the future. He also 
  commented that sales apparently had been unaffected by the Ford 
  strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending in the District continues to lag, but there has 
  been scattered evidence of a pickup. The president of a company 
  producing petroleum and building equipment expected his firm's 
  capital outlays, which were up 50 percent this year, to double next 
  year.. The president of a manufacturing company was also optimistic 
  concerning plans to augment capacity, stating that his firm would be 
  emphasizing machinery and tools rather than additions to plant. On 
  the other hand, the vice president of a mining concern did not feel 
  that his company would increase capital spending before early 1977, 
  and the president of a maritime corporation stated that his company 
  planned to purchase fewer new ships this year than usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production of capital goods in the District continues to lag. A 
  national manufacturer of industrial machinery announced a 2 percent 
  reduction in its work force. At the same time, a major steel 
  producer in western New York announced layoff plans in conjunction 
  with the closing of relatively inefficient blast furnace facilities. 
  Directors of the Buffalo Branch, however, expected the near-term 
  prospects for new orders, production, and employment in steel and 
  other heavy industries in western New York to be strong. One 
  director, whose firm is a major purchaser of steel, contended that 
  press reports were misleading in conveying the impression that 
  recent cutbacks in steel production reflected weak demand. Rather,
  in his view, they were primarily attributable to a spreading out of 
  existing orders to achieve more efficient production.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the recovery in the region's economy since the trough of the 
  recession has still not matched the national recovery, there have 
  been some encouraging signs in the employment situation of late. The 
  seasonally adjusted unemployment rates of both New York City and 
  State held steady from June to August despite an increase in the 
  national rate. Furthermore, in recent months the slide in the City's 
  private employment appears to be coming to a halt. Indeed, for the 
  New York-New Jersey metropolitan area, private employment increased 
  in July for the first gain in almost three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the outlook for price increases, a majority of respondents 
  expected inflation to diminish slowly in coming months. The 
  president of a national retail store chain thought the recent 
  sluggishness of the economy would have a moderating influence on 
  prices—both materials prices and product prices. Consistent with 
  this view, the chief economist for a paper company stated that 
  prices of his firm's products had "softened" recently, and the vice 
  president of a company dealing in minerals said that demand 
  conditions had not allowed cost increases to be passed on. The 
  chairman of a major New York City bank felt that the recent 
  resistance to attempted price increases was encouraging and a 
  healthy development in helping to assure the continuation of the 
  economic expansion. Other respondents echoed this view and generally 
  felt that there was little danger of a return to double-digit 
  inflation. The president of an international oil firm expected 
  industrial prices to increase 5 to 6 percent over the coming year. 
  The Buffalo directors expected prices of industrial materials to 
  rise about 6 to 8 percent during the next six to nine months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although there was a consensus that inflation was likely to 
  diminish, strong cost pressures remained a matter of concern to a 
  number of respondents. One director expected major wage settlements 
  to continue in the neighborhood of 10 percent. A senior economist of 
  a major manufacturer also thought that the momentum for large wage 
  increases still remained. Indeed, he felt that wage increases might 
  become larger as certain groups of workers sought to regain their 
  relative positions in the wage structure. Because this economist 
  felt that the bulk of cyclical productivity gains had been 
  exhausted, he expected upward pressures on prices to remain strong, 
  with prices rising by a minimum of 6 percent in 1977. On the other 
  hand, the president of a major chemical firm anticipated that 
  employees would become less aggressive in their wage demands. As a 
  result, wage settlements would moderate slightly, perhaps to a rate 
  of 8-1/2 percent. An investment banking economist felt that price 
  expectations would wind down, causing wage pressures to moderate. 
  The president of a retail store gave another reason for wage 
  moderation. He expected that businessmen would toughen their 
  bargaining stances as they experienced difficulty in raising prices.
