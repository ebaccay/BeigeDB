      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook is unsettled. Previously, our directors felt comfortable 
  in attempting to fix the timing of the 1975 economic rebound; now 
  they are more insecure and uncertainties cause them to dwell on 
  short-term developments. In December, the New England unemployment 
  rate moved up by .7 percent from the previous month to 9 percent; a 
  year earlier, 6.5 percent of the labor force was unemployed. The 
  Massachusetts unemployment rate was 9.9 percent in December.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in the region are not reassuring the directors. In some 
  markets, inventories are very heavy, according to
      <br/>
      year-end 
  statements. Those firms which were able to report higher revenues 
  note that they were reasonably successful in selling their way out 
  of stock. However, their fortunes are attributed to capturing a 
  larger share of their specific markets, declining auto sales, their 
  offering good values (very aggressive promotions and liquidations by 
  manufacturers are critical here), and, possibly, trading against 
  spring sales. These factors do not contribute to sanguine forecasts. 
  As the unemployment figures are released and as major local 
  manufacturers continue to announce extensions of furloughs, 
  cutbacks, and layoffs, the retailers are growing even more cautious 
  in ordering and planning.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors report that most investment in the region is tied to 
  things one "must" do: cost reduction, replacement, compliance. 
  Expansion is nil, and there is worry that today's musts could be 
  tomorrow's luxuries.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major national firm was recently required to face red tape to get 
  a $1 million loan at an aggressive regional bank. Previously, the 
  red carpet would have been shown. Now, the bank is not sure it wants 
  the business.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a growing fear of realizing a "second tier" in the 
  recession. The directors are attempting to determine whether this 
  recent experience is a "flushing of the pipelines or a snowball." Continuation of dreary prospects may lead to further substantial 
  reductions in growth targets for firms and banks introducing another 
  drop in economic activity. Desirable or not, much business is 
  looking to Washington to lead the economy from the slump: a helpless 
  passive attitude is gaining ground.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our academic correspondents, Professors Samuelson, Solow, Eckstein, 
  Tobin, and Duesenberry, all agreed on three points: 1. The economy 
  is in a serious downward spiral, 2. The proposed tax cuts are 
  insufficient to ensure a recovery, and 3. The Federal Reserve must 
  pursue a more aggressive expansionary policy. Several economists 
  also predicted restrictive monetary policies would unleash a strong 
  political backlash against the System.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the economists emphasized the severity of the current recession. 
  Eckstein said that for the first time since the 1930's, we are in a 
  pure Keynsian spiral of falling incomes and employment. There is no 
  certainty, he concluded, that the economy will generate an upturn. 
  Tobin characterized the economy as in an emergency situation". Solow 
  believes that all the current forecasts are too optimistic. 
  Samuelson said that the economy is giving only one signal: it needs 
  strong fiscal and monetary stimulus.
     </p>
     <p>
      The proposed tax cuts were viewed as inadequate. Tobin pointed out 
  that fiscal policy will be snarled up in Congress for some time, 
  while the need for stimulus is immediate. Like Duesenberry, who 
  argued for $30 billion in tax cuts, Tobin felt that a $16 billion 
  cut was not enough. Samuelson felt that Ford had a minimal program 
  and that the $7 billion tariff would do more for depression than the 
  tax cuts would do for recovery. Solow felt that the budget was 
  inadequately expansionary and that expenditures should be increased. 
  The long lead time on expenditures would be no problem, he noted, 
  since we are at least 3 years away from full employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      On monetary policy, the call was for expansion. None of the 
  economists were impressed with the fourth quarter reserve growth as 
  a reason for not pushing harder to get interest rates down and money 
  supply growth up. Tobin argued that if it is true that demand is not 
  out there, then it cannot do any harm to push reserves out. There is 
  plenty of time to sop up any reserves during a recovery. While he 
  would not be upset by 12 percent growth in M1 if that is what is 
  required to keep interest rates from creeping up, he is personally 
  skeptical that the federal deficit will require it. He thinks the 
  problem has been blown out of all proportion. He sees corporate 
  borrowing as refinancing, not as an additional drain on savings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson echoed the same theme. He argued that getting reserves out 
  isn't the job. One cannot take the multiplier as given. If the 
  multiplier is low because demand is weak, the Fed has to push out 
  even more reserves. He noted that Friedman's criticism about Fed 
  actions during the depression was not that we did not get the 
  reserve out. The Fed did, but it did not push out enough, given a 
  falling multiplier. The real question is whether we forsee too much 
  demand in 8 months. If not, he argued, we cannot effectively say 
  that by doing too much now, then the money will be out there to 
  haunt us. When velocity picks up, we should take the money out. The 
  worst of all possible worlds is for the Fed to stick to one policy 
  too long.
     </p>
     <p>
      Duesenberry thought that financing the deficit might cause a 
  temporary spurt in money supply growth, but that we should not let 
  this be an excuse for letting rates creep up. He believes open 
  market rates should be down a bit more and kept there.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein argued that it was foolish for the Fed to delay in getting 
  rates down. Eckstein agreed with Tobin that the Fed needed to do 
  something dramatic and immediate. Eckstein said the Fed should stop 
  decrying the deficit and should say straight out that the economy is 
  in danger of a depression and that the Fed will do whatever it can 
  to prevent it. He felt that at this time, it was not constructive 
  for the Fed to be concerned about banks' capital adequacy. Our 
  concern should be to help businesses re-establish their liquidity. 
  Both he and Solow thought it was time for the Fed to begin buying
      <br/>
      long-term securities—either agency issues or corporate bonds—as 
  a means of helping business liquidity and reviving investment.
