      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In general, economic activity in the District continued to decline 
  in March. Signs of falling prices and more price competition are 
  increasing. Retail sales of durable goods remain weak, but sales of 
  nondurables are improving. There is considerable evidence of 
  inventory liquidation at both retail and manufacturing levels. Near-term prospects for a recovery in capital spending are not 
  particularly encouraging. Increased deposit inflows have put 
  financial institutions in a better position to help promote recovery 
  in residential construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the consumer sector, new car sales weakened significantly last 
  month, following a surge in February. Car sales in Ohio were 
  depressed, partly because a bill was proposed in the state 
  legislature that would have suspended the sales tax on motor 
  vehicles until June 30. Legislators debated the bill during most of 
  March before finally defeating it.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of our directors in the consumer recreational business commented 
  that revenue from TV and radio advertising is up substantially. 
  Consumer spending for recreation has been exceptionally good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some major retailers in the District report scattered signs of a 
  pickup in soft goods. Sales of big-ticket items remain poor with 
  little prospect of recovery until early next year, according to one 
  source. An executive with a major department store said that he is 
  encouraged by somewhat better than expected sales around Easter, and 
  by collections above estimates in recent weeks. An economist with a 
  department store chain believes that retail sales, except for 
  household goods, bottomed out in January and February. He sees 
  progressive strengthening in sales of soft goods and a completion of 
  inventory liquidation of these goods by May. Continued weakness in 
  appliance and furniture sales is expected until next spring, because 
  of a 9 to 12 month lag between recovery in housing and recovery in 
  household goods. All retailers report excessive inventories of 
  appliances and furniture. Liquidation is not expected to be 
  completed until July or August, according to one source. The 
  treasurer of a financially troubled retail chain said that it has 
  had difficulty building inventories of summer merchandise because 
  its suppliers have held back credit. All firms contacted say that 
  retail prices definitely are moderating—some fall merchandise will 
  be priced below current levels, and price increases for other lines 
  will be much smaller than last fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to purchasing agents in the Cleveland area, production 
  cutbacks were more widespread in March than in previous months. 
  Lower prices became more pervasive, with 40 percent of firms paying 
  lower prices and only 5 percent paying higher prices. (The higher-lower percentages were roughly equal in February.) Our own Survey of 
  District Manufacturers confirms the continued weakening in business 
  during March. For the month of April, firms expect some moderation 
  in the rate of decline in new orders, shipments, backlogs, and 
  employment, but an accelerated rate of inventory liquidation. Auto 
  firms have started to recall some workers, and some automotive 
  suppliers report a pickup in business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel companies report a dramatic decline in new orders. Several 
  major steel firms emphasized that their customers are rapidly 
  liquidating steel inventories. The run-off is expected to continue 
  throughout the second quarter and possibly beyond. Steel shipments 
  will drop sharply this quarter. One firm estimates a decline of 20 
  to 25 percent from the first quarter. Production, however, will not 
  decline as much because steel mills still need to rebuild their 
  inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      The situation in the capital goods sector is mixed, and the outlook 
  is uncertain. An executive with a large industrial machinery firm 
  believes it may step up its capital spending somewhat in light of 
  the more favorable investment tax credit, ITC. Its customers are 
  expected to place orders previously deferred because of expectations 
  that the tax credit would be liberalized. One of the area's major 
  electric utilities said the increase in the ITC is unlikely to 
  increase its spending plans this year. Several of our industrialist 
  directors expressed the view that an acceleration in depreciation 
  allowances would do more to stimulate capital spending than the 
  higher ITC. A highly-regarded economist in the machine tool industry 
  does not expect the ITC to stimulate capital goods much this year, 
  and he continues to forecast no recovery in real capital spending 
  during the second half. His own firm booked four new orders for 
  machine tools in March, whereas cancellations had exceeded new 
  orders during the previous four months. Another machine tool firm 
  said new orders continue to be depressed, but offers to bid on 
  contracts are increasing. A director reports excellent business in 
  his capital goods firm which produces equipment for oil exploration 
  and drilling and coal mining machinery.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the District's construction sector, the decline in residential 
  construction contracts resumed in February, following some 
  improvement in January. Nonresidential building remains depressed. 
  Construction firms in the region are said to be hungry for business, 
  a report that tends to be confirmed by more competitive bidding for 
  public projects. Recently, Ohio awarded the contract for a new 
  bridge to a firm whose bid was almost 25 percent below state 
  engineers' estimated cost. Last month, other bids below estimates 
  were reported for road construction, school remodeling, and a 
  recreation center. One banking director in southern Ohio reported 
  that a home builder, anticipating a recovery in demand by late 
  spring, has started 50 homes without any sales contracts so far.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the financial area, banks report that demand by residential 
  construction builders for new loan commitments has been unchanged. 
  Limited improvement is expected during the second quarter. Some 
  banks that adopted restrictive loan policies for residential 
  construction last year say funds are now available. Ohio's 8 percent 
  usury ceiling on mortgage loans is discouraging some state-chartered 
  banks from lending. Several large S&amp;Ls in Cleveland report excellent 
  deposit inflows in March. But more deposits are in the form of 
  passbook savings and short-term certificates, as savers expect 
  higher yields in the months ahead.
