      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Once again the monthly survey of Fifth District businesses has 
failed to confirm any strong trends. Manufacturers' new orders and 
shipments continued to increase during the past month, but in 
neither case were the increases as widespread as in the three 
previous months. Backlogs and inventories showed little change in 
November, with inventories apparently remaining somewhat higher than 
desired. Employment and weekly hours were also unchanged among 
manufacturing respondents, while price movements continued on the up 
side. One-third of the respondents view current plant and equipment 
capacity as excessive, but nearly all feel current expansion plans 
are about right. Among retailers surveyed, sales increased in 
November, but sales of big-ticket items relative to total sales 
declined. Retail inventories showed little change during the month, 
and all respondents now feel current levels are about right. Fifth 
District banks experienced healthy deposit flows and reduced their 
reliance on borrowed funds in November. Asset expansion was centered 
in the lending area, with seasonal demands for business credit 
continuing to account for most of the activity. There is evidence of 
a greater willingness to make loans of various types, and 
investments are being concentrated in the shorter maturity ranges. 
The November 1 crop report indicates that there will be no record 
harvests in the District in 1975. The cotton crop, in fact, promises 
to be the smallest since records began in 1866.
     </p>
     <p>
      The December survey of manufacturers suggests an overall increase in 
shipments from a month earlier, but reports of increases were less 
common and those of declines more common than in November. Much the 
same picture emerged in relation to the volume of new orders, a 
general increase but less widespread than in recent months. Little 
change is apparent in the level of backlogs or of inventories. In 
fact, survey responses suggest greater stability in inventory levels 
than in any of the last six months. Increases in the number of 
employees and of hours worked per week also seem to have tapered off 
in the past month. On the other hand, reports of price increases 
became more widespread last month than at any time this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the manufacturers surveyed feel current inventory levels are 
about right, but approximately one-fourth continue to view current 
levels as excessive. One-third of the respondents feel plant and 
equipment capacity is currently in excess, but none believe that 
current capital plans should be cut back. Fewer than one in ten 
think current expansion plans should be enlarged. Expectations for 
the level of business activity remain essentially optimistic. A 
majority of respondents expect business activity nationally and in 
their respective market areas to improve over the next six months, 
while one-half expect the level of production in their own firms to 
improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among District retailers surveyed, sales were up over the month, 
while inventories showed little change. Sales of big-ticket items 
relative to total sales declined somewhat after increasing in 
October. Employment in retailing declined in November, but increases 
in employee compensation were reported by all but one of the 
respondents. Price increases were also reported by most. Inventory 
levels have apparently been brought into line with desired levels, 
and 80 percent of the retailers view the current number and size of 
their outlets as about right. Once again, optimism is widespread as 
most retailers expect the level of business activity nationally, 
locally, and in their own firms to improve over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the banking sector, demand deposits of weekly reporting banks 
increased substantially during the month, and lesser but still 
significant gains were posted in time deposits. Purchases of CD's 
also increased, and outstandings are now 3 percent above the year 
ago level. Reliance on borrowed funds is far below the recent norm, 
with discount window borrowings of member banks falling close to 
zero. Average daily net purchases of Federal funds by member banks 
over the first three weeks of November fell by 30 percent from the 
previous month and are now at their lowest level since June.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business loans at weekly reporting banks increased at an annual rate 
of about 6 percent in November, reflecting advances to retailers and 
agricultural processors and increased purchases of bankers' 
acceptances. Commercial and industrial loans are now about 6 percent 
below year ago levels. Small increases in consumer loans were offset 
by declines in the real estate area. The November survey of changes 
in lending practices indicates that a third of the reporting banks 
expect moderately stronger business loan demand over the next three 
months. Business lending terms remain pretty much unchanged at 
District banks, except for some easing of interest rates. Interest 
in and willingness to make all types of loans has increased, 
especially in the consumer area. Investment assets of weekly 
reporting banks declined by 1.3 percent from the previous month, as 
substantial increases in U.S. Government securities were more than 
offset by reductions in municipal portfolios. Investment in Treasury 
bills has been particularly strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      District cash farm income continued to improve during September and 
for the first three quarters of the year recorded a 4-percent gain 
over the same period last year. The biggest improvement occurred in 
livestock receipts. Marketing of the 1975 crop of flue-cured tobacco 
was highlighted by lower prices and poorer quality than in 1974. The 
season average price dropped 5 percent, or $5.47 per hundred, below 
last year's record. Volume was up sharply (17 percent), however, so 
the value of gross sales was 11 percent or $126.3 million above a 
year ago.
