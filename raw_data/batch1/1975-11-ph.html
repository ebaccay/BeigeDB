      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is growing, but at a slow 
pace. Manufacturers in the region report that business conditions 
are better than they were last month, but there is little evidence 
of any substantial gains. New orders are up slightly from last 
month, and inventory liquidation continues. Manufacturing employment 
is also marginally higher, and the average workweek is a shade 
longer. On the inflation front, prices paid and prices received are 
both higher.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Businessmen expect economic activity in the region to expand over 
the next two quarters. They look for new orders to be higher, and 
they plan to stop reducing their inventories. Manufacturing 
employment and the average workweek are both expected to be higher, 
and some increases in capital expenditures are anticipated. But the 
higher level of business activity is expected to be accompanied by 
higher prices as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Area retailers report that sales volumes are higher compared to a 
few months ago and that they are looking for a strong Christmas 
season. Retailers also report an easing of price pressures in their 
sector. Bankers in the region note that demand deposits have 
remained about level while savings accounts have increased slightly 
in recent months. Bankers also indicate that loan volume is 
essentially flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturers responding to this month's Business Outlook Survey 
report an improvement in business over last month. Forty percent of 
the respondents report an increase in business activity this month, 
but there are few signs of any vigorous expansion. While new orders 
are higher, on balance, the increase is substantially below the 
gains reported in each of the previous three months. The proportion 
of respondents reporting increases in new orders this month exceeds 
the proportion reporting declines by only 8 percentage points 
compared to about 30 percentage points on average in the August-October period. At the same time, cutbacks in inventories continue 
with almost 30 percent of the manufacturers polled reporting fewer 
stocks on hand. Employment is slightly higher for the fourth 
consecutive month, and the manufacturing workweek is fractionally 
longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is optimistic. 
Eighty percent of the executives surveyed anticipate further gains. 
New orders are expected to be higher, and no additional reductions 
in inventories are planned. At the same time, employment is expected 
to grow. Almost 40 percent of the respondents expect to add to their 
work forces, and close to 30 percent of them plan to lengthen the 
average workweek. In addition, capital expenditures are beginning to 
perk up. Of the manufacturers surveyed, 35 percent expect to 
increase their spending for plant and equipment by May, while only 5 
percent of them expect to reduce that spending. This difference of 
30 percentage points is the largest net increase since June 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers in the area report that sales are moderately higher than 
they were a few months ago; there are mixed reports on the relative 
strengths of durables and nondurables. One retail executive notes 
that sales are in line with his forecast of last March but below his 
revised forecast of midsummer. All of the retailers contacted are 
looking for a strong Christmas season and a healthy spring. One 
merchant notes that his optimism for next year rests largely on 
continuation of the current tax cut. There is general agreement that 
inventories are at desired levels. One contact is anticipating spot 
shortages of some goods around mid-December. He feels that with 
strong Christmas buying the stocks of some items will be depleted 
and, with the presently conservative attitude on inventories, 
retailers will be reluctant to reorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the inflation front, manufacturers report higher prices this 
month compared to a month ago for the goods they buy as well as for 
those they sell. Fifty-eight percent of the respondents report 
paying higher prices, while 15 percent are receiving higher prices 
for the products they sell. The outlook for the longer term is for 
additional increases. Almost 90 percent of the manufacturers polled 
expect to be paying more for their supplies by May, and close to 70 
percent expect to be charging more for their finished goods. 
Conversely, area retailers report some easing in prices. There is 
general agreement that the upward climb in prices has leveled off to 
some degree, and one merchant notes that the prices he pays for a 
few products have fallen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Area bankers report that loan volume is flat, and they foresee no 
substantial increase through the middle of next year. Most feel that 
excess capacity and substantial corporate liquidity will restrain 
business borrowing in the near future. One financial executive 
expects his bank's volume of both business and consumer loans next 
year to average about 4 percent above year-end 1975 levels. Bankers 
expect the decline in short-term interest rates to be temporary, 
with the prime rate dropping to 7 1/4 percent before turning back up 
as the end of the year approaches. In addition, none of the bankers 
contacted feel that the recent reduction in reserve requirements on 
long-term time and savings accounts will have any significant impact 
on available funds. There is general agreement that the situation in 
New York City has not caused any substantial shift in the attitude 
of area banks toward holding municipal securities. Most of the 
bankers report that municipal bond holdings are being reduced, but 
the primary motive for this, they say, is unrelated to New York 
City. Soft profits have curtailed their need for
       <br/>
       tax-exempt income.
