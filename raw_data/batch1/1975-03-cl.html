      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District economic activity continues to decline generally, although 
  new car sales have been exceptionally strong. Firms report 
  considerable further slowing in prices they pay for materials and 
  supplies. Few companies see any near-term improvement in business. 
  Many industries expect further weakness in the months ahead, 
  although there are scattered reports of bottoming-out for a limited 
  number of products. Numerous layoffs have been reported thus far in 
  March. Nonresidential construction is declining, and residential 
  construction remains severely depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales rebounded in February much more in the Cleveland area 
  than in the nation. Compared with year-ago figures, sales in 
  Cleveland were down 22 percent in January, but up 13 percent in 
  February. This reflected the effects of not only the manufacturers' 
  rebates but also bonuses offered by a number of firms in the 
  Cleveland-Akron area to employees who purchased a new car. These 
  included a steel company, two advertising agencies, an auto 
  producer, several large banks, a radio station, two major tire 
  companies and various auto suppliers. In addition, some banks helped 
  promote auto sales by advertising reduced interest rates on auto 
  loans. Many firms will continue the rebates until late spring or 
  early summer. Cleveland auto dealers report that sales have slowed 
  thus far in March; but their inventories are down, and they are 
  placing orders for April delivery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early returns from our survey of manufacturers indicate additional 
  widespread weakening in manufacturing activity during February. New 
  orders, shipments, backlogs, inventories, employment, and hours all 
  continued to decline sharply. In addition, price pressures continue 
  to ease. The proportion of firms reporting price decreases has risen 
  significantly in recent months and is now roughly equal to the 
  proportion paying higher prices. On balance, no improvement in 
  general business conditions is expected this month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several industrialists believe the worst of the decline in a few 
  product lines may be over. One chemical producer said its business 
  has been sliding, but the decline in pigments (for industrial, 
  commercial, and household appliance uses) appears to have bottomed 
  out. Another chemicals firm said its inventory excesses are rapidly 
  dwindling, and it expects to increase production in March. A machine 
  tool executive is hopeful that signs of a bottoming-out in its 
  declining order bookings are appearing (cancellations exceeded new 
  orders by only one machine in February, compared with a significant 
  volume of cancellations in excess of new orders in the previous 
  three months).
     </p>
     <p>
      Other firms indicate further adverse developments may be in store. A 
  major tire producer said the tire replacement business remains weak. 
  Tire inventories held by the industry are massive and still rising. 
  More production cutbacks and layoffs will be necessary. Shipments of 
  household appliances are described as "miserable". A large appliance 
  firm said it will take three to five months to bring inventories 
  into balance. Sales are not expected to improve until midyear, 
  assuming tax rebates become effective in late spring. Several large 
  glass companies laid off a substantial number of additional workers 
  in late February and early March. A major truck producer in 
  Cleveland, which cut output one third last month, is closing its 
  Cleveland plant for two weeks in March and three weeks in April.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the steel industry, new orders are tapering off slowly. The 
  decline in steel demand thus far has centered mainly in stainless 
  and specialty steels and in carbon steel sheet and strip. The result 
  has been cutbacks and fairly substantial layoffs at a number of 
  steel plants in the District. Further curtailments and layoffs are 
  likely over the next two months unless there is an unexpected quick 
  improvement in steel demand. Much of the raw steel currently being 
  produced is going into mill inventories to rebuild stocks run down 
  last year when demand was extraordinarily strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      An economist with a major steel company said he was invited to visit 
  with purchasing agents of three auto producers in recent weeks. The 
  auto firms were looking for price cuts and were wondering who was 
  buying all the steel they were not taking. (Some of the sheet metal 
  that would normally be purchased by the auto companies is being used 
  for storage tanks, which are in strong demand.) The economist noted 
  that the auto firms are torn between wanting lower steel prices and 
  wanting the steel industry to generate profits sufficient to expand 
  capacity so as to avoid future bottlenecks in supply. The auto 
  companies still have large inventories of steel even though they 
  have sold some flat-rolled steel that has age hardened. They are not 
  expected to be ordering steel until the model changeover this 
  summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the construction sector, nonresidential building contracts have 
  been declining sharply since the peak reached in the third quarter 
  of last year. Residential construction contracts turned up 
  moderately in January but are still at a severely depressed level. 
  The dollar value of residential contracts is down about 50 percent 
  from the peak of early 1973. Some local savings and loan 
  associations report continued net gains in deposits in February and 
  early March. Mortgage rates continue to slide, but there has been no 
  recent pickup in loans.
