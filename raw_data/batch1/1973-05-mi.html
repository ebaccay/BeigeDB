      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 9, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       Bank directors expressed dissatisfaction with Phase III, but their 
views varied on how to contend with the economy's current 
inflationary pressures. Gasoline rationing has begun in the 
district, and businessmen fear fuel shortages could hamper district 
economic activity. Although some overbuilding exists in the 
Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, bank directors generally 
indicated that in their areas the outlook for residential and 
nonresidential construction was favorable. District agricultural 
loan demand was strong in the first quarter and is expected to 
remain vigorous in the second quarter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank directors expressed various views on how to control the 
inflationary pressures currently confronting the economy. Several 
directors advocated eliminating the investment tax credit, while 
others favored retaining it. A variable investment tax credit, which 
could be adjusted in response to changing business conditions, was 
favored by some directors. A South Dakota director indicated that 
his area's farm implement dealers would oppose eliminating the 
investment tax credit which has significantly boosted their 
business. Another opinion was that abolishing the investment tax 
credit would not dampen consumer demand and would have a delayed 
effect on the economy. Bank directors felt that an increase in the 
personal income tax was not politically feasible, and one indicated 
that his area's businessmen believed increased taxes would only 
result in increased government spending. A cutback in government 
expenditures was advocated by several directors, and one director 
spoke out for tighter monetary policy. Allowing interest rates to 
reach their own level, one director stated, would help dampen 
economic activity. Directors generally felt Phase III had not been 
effective and favored firmer controls. Although one director 
welcomed the Administration's recent move to strengthen Phase III, 
he felt it may not be sufficient to curb inflationary pressures.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although no director reported any disruption in business activity 
due to fuel shortages, businessmen are concerned about a lack of 
gasoline dampening district economic activity. Two major oil 
companies have begun rationing gasoline at the retail level in 
Minnesota, and in March 104 Minnesota independent gasoline stations 
were forced to close because of gasoline shortages. Also, two oil 
companies plan to stop servicing Minnesota customers. Furthermore, 
several large Minnesota fuel users have reported difficulties 
obtaining fuel supplies, and Minnesota's state civil defense 
department estimated that Minnesota's gasoline supplies may be about 
10 percent short of anticipated needs by the end of 1973. Another 
director reported gasoline rationing in South Dakota and indicated 
dealers were taking steps to prohibit gasoline hoarding. Also, 
dealers have stopped giving trade discounts which has noticeably 
increased fuel costs. A North Dakota director disclosed concern over 
fuel shortages in his state and revealed his firm recently had 
trouble purchasing diesel fuel. Directors from Minnesota, North 
Dakota, and South Dakota indicated gasoline shortages could curb 
their areas' tourist business this summer. Montana directors and a 
director from the upper peninsula of Michigan, on the other hand, 
revealed that gasoline shortages are not yet a problem in their 
areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the exception of the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area and 
Duluth, the outlook for residential and nonresidential construction 
in the district is quite favorable. In the Minneapolis/St. Paul 
area, overbuilding exists in both residential and nonresidential 
markets. Single-family constructions however, has remained quite 
strong but could be curtailed by rising prices. Two directors 
located on the fringe of the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area 
indicated strong construction activity in their areas. In Duluth, a 
director disclosed a lack of new construction projects, and some 
construction material shortages. A Montana director reported strong 
construction activity throughout his state but indicated that the 
Administration's impounding of highway funds has hurt highway 
construction. Many directors indicated that rising prices had not 
discouraged new home purchases, but one director revealed that his 
area's residents were turning to prefabricated homes in order to 
hold down new home prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our second-quarter Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey showed that 
the demand for farm loans increased substantially during the first 
quarter and is expected to remain strong in the second quarter. 
Stronger first-quarter loan demand was due to greater spending by 
farmers and to difficulties in selling wheat in currently clogged 
marketing channels. An inability to market wheat postponed income 
and forced farmers to borrow to meet current operating expenses. 
Greater spending was primarily associated with this year's planned 
increased crop plantings and a general expansion in farm operations. 
District farmers' outlays for machinery, land, and cattle were up 
noticeably. Higher prices for cattle, fertilizer, seed, and 
equipment also raised agricultural borrowing this spring. Survey 
respondents look for these same factors to result in strong second-quarter agricultural loan demand, especially as some items, such as 
fuel and fertilizer, become increasingly costly.
