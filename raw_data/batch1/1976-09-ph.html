      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is expanding, but at an 
  uneven clip. While performance in the retail sector is mixed, 
  conditions in manufacturing continue to improve gradually. Gains are 
  reported in new orders and shipments, while work forces and 
  inventories in manufacturing are unchanged. The longer-term outlook 
  both in retailing and manufacturing remains optimistic. Bankers 
  report that business borrowing is still weak and expect this to 
  continue in the near term. Businessmen indicate that prices are 
  still rising, but no substantial change in inflationary pressures is 
  evident. Major manufacturers in the District report that production 
  capacity is adequate to meet current requirements and expect to be 
  able to meet customers' demands in the foreseeable future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to this month's business outlook survey 
  report that business is better than in August. Four out of ten 
  executives surveyed indicate improvement in overall business 
  conditions compared to three out of ten last month. New orders and 
  shipments are higher; and inventories, which declined last month, 
  are reported to be unchanged from a month ago. In terms of 
  employment, the factory workweek is fractionally longer this month, 
  while work forces are at the same level as in August. This is the 
  first time since March that no growth has been recorded in the 
  number of employees in manufacturing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the current pause in the national economy, the outlook in 
  area manufacturing for the next 6 months is optimistic. Of the 
  businessmen surveyed, two out of three project a higher level of 
  economic activity by next March. Increases are anticipated in new 
  orders, shipments and employment. At the same time, higher levels of 
  spending for plant and equipment are projected by 40 percent of 
  those surveyed—roughly the same proportion of respondents as last 
  month. No additional investment is planned in inventories, which are 
  expected to be virtually unchanged from present levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the area paint a mixed picture with sales ranging from 
  16 percent above, to a level slightly below, the same period last 
  year. No specific merchandise lines are cited as particularly strong 
  or weak. The majority of retailers feel that "things are looking up" compared to the lull of a few months ago, but they view this 
  improvement as gradual and below the forecasts they made earlier in 
  the year. The outlook for the near term is for an improved sales 
  picture, although no big surge in buying is expected until late in 
  the year. One merchant anticipates a boost in sales after the 
  election, and another looks for a loosening of purse strings for 
  big-ticket items around the holidays. If this occurs on top of 
  normal gift buying, this retailer feels that the fourth quarter will 
  be fairly strong. However, he's doubtful that it will show any 
  substantial improvement over the last quarter of 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the inflation front, manufacturers report paying and receiving 
  higher prices this month. One-half of the executives in the current 
  survey report paying more for their inputs, and one-third indicate 
  charging higher prices for outputs. Over the next half year, 84 
  percent expect to be paying more for their supplies and 75 percent 
  anticipate higher prices for their finished products. At the same 
  time, retailers report that the hesitancy in consumer demand is 
  helping to moderate the upward movements in the prices they pay for 
  supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the region report that loan volume remains basically 
  flat. Consumer loans are level or up somewhat, but there are no 
  signs yet of any recovery in business borrowing. At the same time, 
  retail savings deposits are rising, although most bankers feel that 
  the increase has been disappointing in the face of the softness in 
  short-term interest rates available elsewhere in the market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Down the road, bankers are looking for the lull in business loan 
  demand to continue. According to one executive, "We don't expect 
  volume to improve before yearend, at the earliest." Another sees the 
  possibility of the weakness continuing through the first quarter of 
  1977. The outlook for interest rates is for little change over the 
  rest of 1976; and for 1977, forecasts of the prime rate call for an 
  average of about 7 1/2 percent. This is down from a few months ago 
  when a prime of 8 percent was considered possible by yearend 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      The question of production capacity was examined with executives in 
  the food, apparel, chemical, petroleum, steel, nonelectrical 
  machinery, and electrical machinery industries. For all of these 
  industries, except chemicals, business is reported to be the same 
  as, or better than, in June. Nevertheless, no major supply 
  bottlenecks are reported, and any increased pressure on production 
  capacity seems to be minimal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Compared to a few months ago, operating rates in food, apparel, and 
  petroleum are unchanged (90-95 percent). In chemicals, an executive 
  of one large company notes that utilization in some fiber operations 
  is down to 70 percent from 90 percent in early spring, At the same 
  time, a major steel producer notes that one plant manufacturing 
  rails is running near capacity, but another producing structural 
  shapes still has plenty of slack. Conditions at both of these plants 
  are about the same as in June. Two industries that report declining 
  excess capacity are electrical and nonelectrical machinery. But in 
  both of these industries, such reductions in unused resources appear 
  to be slight. Operating rates are put around 85 percent—at most, 
  only a few percentage points above June levels, Delivery times are
  lengthening in these industries, but not "significantly" according 
  to the executives contacted.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, manufacturers expect capacity utilization to 
  rise somewhat, but none of the officials contacted foresees 
  substantial problems in meeting customers' demands over the next 6 
  months.
