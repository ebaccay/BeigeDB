      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District are improving but at an 
  uneven pace. Retail activity has softened, while the manufacturing 
  sector continues to expand. Increases are reported in new orders, 
  shipments, and employment, while inventories in manufacturing are 
  lower. The longer-term outlook both in retailing and manufacturing 
  remains optimistic. Bankers report that consumer loans are inching 
  up but see no signs yet of any pickup in business borrowing. 
  Businessmen indicate that prices continue to rise, but inflationary 
  pressures are about the same as last month. Major manufacturers in 
  the District report no current bottlenecks in production and expect 
  no significant problems within the next 12 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers, responding to the latest business outlook 
  survey, report a higher level of economic activity than last month. 
  Close to one-half of the businessmen surveyed see an improvement in 
  general business conditions. Specifically, 38 percent of the 
  respondents indicate gains in new orders and 36 percent note 
  increases in shipments. This is similar to the proportions reporting 
  increases last month but below the gains reported in March and 
  April. Employment in manufacturing shows additional improvement this 
  month. The factory workweek is longer for the fourth month in a row, 
  and work forces are rising at 17 percent of the businesses surveyed. 
  The proportion of firms indicating fewer jobs dropped from 16 
  percent in March to only 2 percent in the latest survey. At the same 
  time, inventory levels declined this month for the first time since 
  January. The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is for 
  further expansion. Of the executives polled, 79 percent look for an 
  improved business climate by December. Further gains are expected 
  for employment as well: One-fourth of the respondents project a 
  longer workweek and four out of ten expect to hire additional 
  employees. At the same time, 43 percent of the manufacturers 
  surveyed anticipate increases in inventories. This is down somewhat 
  from last month, when 53 percent were projecting gains six months 
  out. Plans for increases in capital expenditures are off slightly as 
  well. Thirty-four percent of the respondents in the current survey 
  plan to hike their spending for plant and equipment, compared to 46 
  percent last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the price front, manufacturers report paying and receiving higher 
  prices, but there is little change in the distribution of responses 
  from last month. Forty-nine percent of those surveyed report paying 
  more for their inputs, and 17 percent are charging more for their 
  finished products. By December, 87 percent expect to be paying more 
  for supplies and 72 percent anticipate higher prices for the 
  products they sell. In the retail sector, prices are currently 
  reported to be increasing "moderately."
     </p>
     <p>
      Area retailers report a slowdown in sales but continue to be 
  optimistic for the rest of this year. Merchants are unanimous in 
  labeling retail activity as "disappointing" in the latest sales 
  period. Reported sales volumes range from 2 percent above to 4 
  percent below the same period last year. Most of the retailers note 
  that the whole spectrum of wearing apparel was especially weak. One 
  merchant notes additional weakness in draperies, housewares, and 
  major appliances. Several reasons are offered for this softening in 
  sales: a stretch of unseasonably cold weather, the necessity for 
  consumers to begin paying for installment purchases made in the 
  first quarter, and the absence of a boost to spendable income like 
  that provided by the tax rebate last year. Despite current sales 
  performance, retailers continue to be optimistic for the remainder 
  of 1976. However, as one executive put it, "If the next sales period 
  turns out to be as disappointing as the current one, we'll have to 
  adjust our sights for the fall."
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the District report that loan volume continues to be 
  soft. Consumer loans are moving up slightly, while business loans 
  are characterized as "flat." Bankers are unanimous in citing high 
  levels of corporate liquidity and a very cautious approach to 
  building inventories as reasons for soft business loan demand. There 
  is general agreement that loan volume will be higher by year-end, 
  but bankers are uncertain about the timing and degree of the pickup. 
  The consensus is for a mild increase in the third quarter and for 
"somewhat more strength" in the final quarter of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interest rates are expected to move upward gradually. The majority 
  of bankers contacted anticipate a prime rate of 8 percent by the end 
  of this year, with one seeing the possibility of 8 1/2 percent. None 
  of the financial executives contacted feel that the anticipated rise 
  in interest rates through the first quarter of 1977 will hamper 
  economic expansion. However, several are concerned that the recovery 
  in housing may be slowed if long-term rates continue to move up.
     </p>
     <p>
      The question of capacity utilization and bottlenecks in production 
  was explored with executives in the food, apparel, chemical, 
  petroleum, steel, nonelectrical machinery, and electrical machinery 
  industries. Estimates of present capacity utilization by these 
  businessmen range from 55 percent at one steel company to 95 percent 
  at a firm in the apparel industry. However, not many of the firms 
  contacted report current rates close to these extremes. Most of the 
  reported current operating rates lie within the 70-85-percent range. 
  In general, capacity utilization is now about 20 percentage points 
  above levels recorded in the first and second quarters of 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers report that they are presently experiencing no 
  constraints on production. There are no reported problems with raw 
  materials, labor, or fuel requirements. There are scattered reports 
  of large price increases for some raw materials, but these are not 
  considered to be hampering production. For example, one clothing 
  manufacturer notes that piece cloth prices are now 160 percent above 
  two years ago, but he adds that this is causing him no problems. In 
  addition, a producer of nonelectrical machinery reports that cotton 
  imported from the Far East costs twice as much today as it did a 
  year ago. However, he is still ordering with relatively short lead 
  times for delivery. In 1973 and 1974, this businessman was ordering 
  cotton from the Far East a year ahead of the desired delivery time, 
  whereas now he is ordering only three months out. At the same time, 
  some manufacturers report an improvement in their supply picture. A 
  producer of canned foods indicates that it is easier to obtain 
  tinplate now than it was in 1974, and a chemical manufacturer notes 
  an improvement in natural gas supplies. According to this executive, "We were under the threat of a natural gas shortage in the fall of 
  1975, but we've been informed that supplies will be adequate at 
  least through this winter."
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, most of the manufacturers contacted feel that 
  they can meet anticipated increases in demand. The clothing 
  manufacturer, whose firm is running at 95 percent of capacity, has 
  recently enlarged an existing plant by 50 percent and, along with 
  subcontracting, expects to be able to meet customers' needs through 
  the fall. All of the manufacturers contacted project higher 
  operating rates by year-end, but there are no concrete expectations 
  of plant and equipment constraints within the next 9-12 months. 
  There is more uncertainty about the second half of 1977, however, 
  and some executives see the "possibility" of running into capacity 
  constraints by late 1977. Nevertheless, those who see such a threat 
  are not expecting a return to the severe conditions of 1974.
