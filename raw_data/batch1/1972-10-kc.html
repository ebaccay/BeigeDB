      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 11, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Vigorous economic activity in the District is being bolstered by 
strength in the agricultural and construction sectors and in 
automobile sales. Overall activity is being supported by strong 
demands in all major loan categories at commercial banks. At the 
same time, growth in savings inflows and in mortgage loans and 
commitments is sustaining a high level of residential construction. 
Recent developments surrounding the export of farm products are also 
contributing to an improved income situation in the important 
agricultural sector of the District's economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand continues strong at District banks, with heavy demands 
being experienced in all major loan categories. Most District banks 
surveyed increased their prime rate to 5 3/4 percent during the 
first week of October reflecting both heavy business loan demand and 
national financial developments. The recent run-up of short-term 
interest rates, which has increased the cost of short-term funds, 
has also put upward pressure on the prime rate at District Banks. 
Despite the upward adjustment of offering rates on CD's, the volume 
of CD's has declined substantially at District banks since the end 
of August.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several District bankers expressed concern about the possibility of 
disintermediation, even though present inflows of time and savings 
deposits have been strong. Rates on consumer-type time deposits are 
generally at ceiling levels. No consensus has developed regarding 
market rate levels that will trigger deposit outflows, but many 
bankers feel that both consumer-type time deposits and large CD's 
will be affected if present trends continue. In anticipation of this 
prospect, several banks are actively attempting to extend deposit 
maturities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings inflows to District savings and loan institutions were 
reported to be down a bit from last year by respondents in Kansas 
City and Oklahoma City, but from "surprisingly steady" to "coming in 
strong" by institutions in Wichita, Topeka, Omaha, and Denver. On 
the whole, rates offered for savings remain the same, but average 
effective rates paid have risen as increasing numbers of depositors 
have been switching from passbook to certificate accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage commitments and loans of savings and loan institutions have 
apparently stabilized somewhat, with slight declines noted in some 
areas. However, respondents from Omaha and Oklahoma City emphasized 
that the small declines left loan activity very strong because of 
the phenomenal pace of lending earlier. Much the same thing was said 
about construction activity—continued strength in building in most 
areas, though somewhat reduced from earlier peaks. Some further 
slowing down was anticipated in residential building in the Kansas 
City Area and in apartment starts in Omaha. Respondents from Omaha 
and Denver were a little apprehensive about possible overbuilding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dollar value of residential construction contract awards so far 
in 1972 continues to be well above the 1971 level for the District 
and for most of its larger cities. Speculative building of single 
family dwellings continues strong in the Kansas City Area, according 
to home construction firms surveyed. Most contractors are not 
concerned with overbuilding at this point, although several 
mentioned "hearsay" comments that demand is slowing. Nearly all of 
the homebuilders were of the opinion that there were plenty of funds 
available to both builders and buyers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contract awards for nonresidential building and for public works and 
utilities have also shown increased strength across the District 
this year, except for Western Missouri. General contractors in the 
Kansas City Area are expecting an improvement in 1972, however, 
partly due to an expected increase in highway construction activity 
in both Kansas and Missouri.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of domestic automobiles by District dealers are very strong. 
Introductory sales of new models are reported to be better than last 
year, almost without exception. "Hold-the-line" pricing on 1973 
models is given some of the credit, because many customers believe 
that higher prices are just a matter of time. Many dealers, however, 
are convinced that price increases will not retard sales increases 
very much. Nearly all dealers expect 1973 model-year sales to be 
outstanding. At the same time, clean-up sales of 1972 models have 
gone exceptionally well, and inventories of 1972 cars are very low. 
Sales of imported autos are not sharing the buoyancy in domestic car 
sales, although later introduction of new models is undoubtedly a 
factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net farm income for the United States for 1972 is now expected to 
reach $18.6 billion, or $500 million more than reported earlier, 
according to the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The change is due 
primarily to the huge grain sales to the Soviet Union, amounting to 
roughly $1 billion. The projections for wheat and feed grain exports 
have also been revised sharply upward for the 1972-1973 marketing 
year. District states produce approximately 40 percent of the wheat 
and 20 percent of the feed grains that are exported from the United 
States each year. Thus, these new developments in the farm income 
picture should boost the final figures for 1972 District farm 
income, although many farmers forfeited higher incomes by selling 
their wheat before the sharp price jump in August and September. 
However, historical records in Kansas indicate that, even after 
allowing for heavier than usual marketings in June and July, 
probably 50-60 percent of the new crop was still under farmer 
control when the full magnitude of wheat sales to Russia became 
apparent.
