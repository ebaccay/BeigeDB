      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 11, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Reports from businessmen and directors continue to point to a 
    softening in the economy, easing of most shortages and faster 
    delivery time, sluggishness in pre-holiday sales, and some price 
    reductions. Plant closings and layoffs are reported from many parts 
    of the District, with the textile industry most severely affected. 
    Directors in the Birmingham area still rate inflation as the 
    country's number one economy problem, however. Despite all the 
    gloom, some favorable signs were noticeable, with several 
    announcements of new industrial projects, as well as strong 
    possibilities of new business contracts for some District firms. The 
    latest crop reports are mixed, but the picture is generally better 
    than that of a year ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent meeting of leading District businessmen indicated that in 
    most areas, business has weakened substantially. As reported last 
    month, the situation in the lumber industry is bleak. There has been 
    a 30- to 40-per cent decline in lumber prices. Many lumber mills 
    have closed down, and concern was expressed whether they would ever 
    reopen if and when construction activity picks up. Retail 
    representatives reported that people are now more sensitive to 
    bargains than they have been in nearly 30 years. The items moving 
    best are necessity and utility items, not luxury goods. Both 
    retailers present at the meeting expect a good toy season; the sales 
    declines will be in adult items. The representative for one of 
    Atlanta's largest shopping centers indicated that the retailers who 
    rely heaviest on credit sales are now having trouble. Apparel sales 
    are reported as very weak. An apparel manufacturer indicated a 
    softening in bookings after seven straight years of increases. Fall 
    sales were disappointing, and Christmas sales are turning out 
    equally bleak. He reports that bookings for spring are terrible; 
    this appears to be the situation for most apparel manufacturers. 
    Textile mill business is also off substantially. One businessman 
    noted that only about 6 of 35 Georgia textile mills are operating 
    frill time. Textile prices are now falling sharply. The apparel 
    manufacturer stated that by the middle of next year, apparel prices 
    will be below this year's prices. An executive for a large soft 
    drink company indicated that the surge in sugar prices and 
    consequent product price increases have not severely affected their 
    unit sales. He thought that the current pricing policy in the food 
    industry was based on anticipation of price controls. In other 
    words, food retailers are hedging in order to be in the most 
    favorable price situation if controls should be enacted. This soft 
    drink representative also indicated increases in slow payments of 
    accounts receivable, particularly by large supermarket chains.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports of letups in shortages and quicker delivery time continue to 
    trickle in. A Louisiana businessman reports that materials are now 
    readily available, particularly for housing materials. Steel may be 
    still in short supply; but, even in the case of steel, a Tennessee 
    steel executive believes that inventories were built up in 
    anticipation of a prolonged coal strike. He indicates that some 
    steel inventory liquidation is now taking place at a price less than 
    the original purchase price. Another Louisiana businessman said that 
    past slow deliveries and rapid price increases on hard goods, 
    hardware, and plastic items because of shortage conditions have 
    ended. Some suppliers are now reducing prices to entice the 
    wholesaler to purchase. A representative of a large oil company, 
    however, indicated that they were still experiencing difficulty in 
    ordering steel pipe, fittings, valves, structural steel, and 
    electrical supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The textile industry, as mentioned above, heads the list of plant 
    closings and layoffs. Two carpet mills recently closed their doors 
    in North Georgia; two carpet mills in Chattanooga have also closed. 
    A yarn-spinning plant has closed down in Columbus, Georgia. Chemical 
    plants have also been laying off workers. A Knoxville, Tennessee, 
    plant furloughed 300 workers. Nashville's Dupont plant recently laid 
    off 250 workers. This plant makes dacron, which is used by the 
    slumping textile industry. Union Carbide recently announced a layoff 
    of about 300 workers at a plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Magnavox 
    (electrical equipment) has laid off 1,400 employees in plants in 
    Tennessee and North Carolina.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the economic news wasn't bad, however. Central Florida's sagging 
    economy will get a much needed shot in the arm, as Occidental 
    Chemical Company increases phosphate production to meet domestic and 
    foreign demands; 3,325 new jobs will be created. It is also 
    estimated that 5,540 supportable new jobs will be created by the 
    company's expansion. Lockheed-Georgia's future is looking up. The 
    Marietta, Georgia, plant may move into full-scale production of the 
    C5A cargo transport if the deal with Iran goes through. South 
    Alabama is experiencing an oil boom. They anticipate the discovery 
    of some 15 to 20 new oil fields over the next 5 to 10 years. Several 
    new and expanded plant announcements were made. U. S. Steel 
    Corporation is pouring another huge sum, estimated at $100 million, 
    into its Fairfield works in Birmingham, Alabama, to help supply the 
    south's steel market, now recognized as the fastest growing in the 
    nation. The Atomic Energy Commission gave the go-ahead for 
    construction of a $445 million nuclear power plant in St. Charles 
    Parish, Louisiana.
      </p>
      <p>
       Latest crop reports are mixed. Mid-November saw the first weighing 
    in of the burley tobacco crop in Tennessee; the yield per acre was 
    up 75 pounds from last year. Tennessee's cotton crop prospects are 
    very gloomy this year, but corn harvesting is at a normal pace. 
    Louisiana's agricultural production, going into November, indicated 
    a drop in cotton and sugar cane, while rice and soybeans remained 
    unchanged.
