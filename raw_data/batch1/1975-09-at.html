      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

       September 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Depressed sectors of the regional economy show signs of reviving. 
Some purchasing managers enjoy a buyer's market; others question how 
long it can last. Poultry and livestock producers in the Sixth 
District are already feeling the pinch of higher feed prices, partly 
as a result of export sales of grain. Impending shortages of natural 
gas pose relatively mild problems for commercial and residential 
customers, although for certain industrial customers the outlook is 
less bright.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Recently announced changes in production suggest recovery in various 
sectors which were previously depressed. A Tennessee manufacturer 
has announced a 16 percent increase in the production of gas and 
electric ranges beginning in early September. The increase is 
attributed to increased orders over the past two months and will 
result in additional employment and restoration of operations to 70 
percent of capacity. Production is resuming after a one-year lapse 
at a large sawmill in Georgia. Also, a Florida plant, which 
manufactures corrugated shipping containers, is resuming production 
as of October 15, following an expansion program. A Tennessee 
furniture manufacturer expects to begin by late September the 
manufacture of a new line of furniture. Production will begin with 
the rehiring of employees laid off since last spring and over the 
next six months should result in an expansion of employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourist activity appears to be strong in many areas, according to 
reports from directors and other sources. Hotel occupancy and 
associated tax revenues show increases. Some brightening has 
appeared in the housing market, as new permits have increased and 
inventories in South Florida and other areas are declining. A large 
life insurance company reports a decline since February in its 
policy lapse ratio, followed by a leveling off of the ratio of 
policy loans to policy reserves. These developments are regarded as 
signs of economic strengthening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Members of a Georgia Purchasing Managers' Organization, surveyed 
from June through August, indicate that delivery times are 
stabilizing. The proportion reporting faster deliveries has declined 
markedly as of August, with most respondents indicating little 
further change in that month. A marked shift has also occurred in 
the movement of prices. The percentage reporting higher prices has 
risen from 25 to 40 percent; the proportion responding that prices 
are the same as in the previous month has risen from 43 to 60 
percent; and the proportion reporting declining prices has fallen 
from one-third in June to zero in August. Survey results indicate 
that order backlogs are increasing on the whole. Throughout the 
period, declining inventories are reported by a substantially 
greater number of respondents for raw materials than for finished 
goods. Conversely, a larger proportion of respondents report 
increases in finished goods stocks than those indicating growth in 
raw materials inventories. Conversations with individual purchasing 
agents convey an impression of shorter delivery times and sporadic 
price negotiability. Use of escalator clauses in contracts for items 
as diverse as heavy equipment and food services is reported. 
Reemergence of delays in delivery for items such as fabricated metal 
products, plant, and certain printing supplies is attributed by some 
to overly zealous inventory reductions by suppliers rather than to 
shortages of goods at the point of manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
       This District's important poultry and livestock industry is feeling 
effects from grain sales to Russia. The increased cost of feed has 
narrowed the profit margin for eggs. Further feed cost increases or 
a decline in retail prices may result in additional bankruptcies 
among producers and a further curtailment in the size of the 
nation's egg flock, now at its lowest point in 30 years. In the 
broiler industry, placements have increased in response to an 
improved feed-price ratio. Although hog production has again become 
profitable because of reduced output, producers' decisions to 
increase the number of hogs await indications concerning the size of 
the corn harvest and its effect on the price of feed. Cattle 
producers had hoped for increased prices of lightweight feeder 
calves as a result of lower feed grain prices, but instead witnessed 
further declines in cattle prices as Russian purchases increased the 
cost of grain. A substantial number of producers may be unable to 
survive another year of depressed cattle prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent press reports indicate that, with the possible exception of 
Tennessee, shortages of natural gas will be felt primarily by 
industrial users served on an interruptible basis. Reports of 
adequate supplies for residential and commercial customers come from 
the state energy office in Atlanta as well as a large utility 
company which maintains underground storage facilities for natural 
gas and a variety of supplementary sources of supply. The principal 
pipeline supplier of gas also confirms the adequacy of supplies, 
except for large industrial customers such as electric utilities 
using gas as a fuel for boilers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Executives of two major regional electric utilities discount the 
threat posed by a gas shortage to their companies' operations. One 
relies primarily upon coal as a fuel; the other, which in the past 
has depended primarily upon natural gas, is in the final stage of an 
extensive conversion program to permit alternate use of fuel oil. 
Provisions include facilities for the supply and storage of liquid 
fuels. A series of nuclear-powered generating facilities is being 
constructed by a major regional utility holding company, and 
additional coal-powered units are also under construction. Utility 
spokesmen voice the opinion that users of natural gas have been 
tardy in developing alternate fuel sources, in part because of 
reluctance to confront the problem and also because of the 
impediments to additional investment posed by shortages of capital.
      </p>
      <p>
       A leading electric power supplier in this region anticipates a 
normal cyclical increase in industrial demand for power because 
there is no expectation of natural gas shortages severe enough to 
seriously curtail the operations of its customers. The technical 
difficulty was also noted of conversion from gas to coal as a boiler 
fuel. Use of coal involves substantial materials handling problems 
and requires storage facilities and much more complicated equipment 
with reduced reliability.
