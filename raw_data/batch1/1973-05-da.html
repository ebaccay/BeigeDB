      Beige Book Report: Dallas

      <strong>
       May 9, 1973
      </strong>

       The economy of the Eleventh District continues to expand at a fairly 
rapid pace. Although industrial production in Texas fell slightly in 
March, employment in the five district states continued to rise. 
Construction activity rebounded sharply in March, and new automobile 
registrations increased substantially. Sales of district department 
stores continued to advance in April. Furthermore, a recent survey 
of business economists in district states revealed them to be quite 
optimistic about economic conditions in the second half of 1973.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our respondents generally expected economic activity in the second 
half of 1973 to be higher for their states than for the nation as a 
whole. They were particularly optimistic about the prospects for 
consumer spending and plant and equipment investment. They also felt 
that inventory investment would continue strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       In line with this general optimism, the majority of the respondents 
expected further employment gains in the second half of the year. 
Most expected growth in employment to be greater in the district 
than in the nation. The respondents anticIpated particularly strong 
employment advances in the retail trade and service industries, and 
in state and local government. Despite the outlook for rising 
employment, less than half saw the unemployment rate declining 
significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the respondents viewed prospects for corporate profits in 
the second half of 1973 to be about the same as in the first half. 
And although there were wide differences of opinion among the 
respondents, the majority felt that consumer prices would rise at 
least as fast in the second half of the year as in the first half. 
Consequently, there was unanimous agreement that there would be a 
continuation of wage-price controls throughout 1973, and a number of 
respondents expected some further strengthening in the controls 
program.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index eased 
slightly in March, receding from its record February level. Output 
in both the manufacturing and mining sectors declined slightly, 
while utilities rose. In manufacturing, durable goods production 
continued to rise mainly as a result of increases in fabricated 
metal products, furniture and fixtures, and lumber and wood 
products. Nondurable goods output fell in March due primarily to 
decreases in food and food products, apparel, and paper and paper 
products. Mining also fell as declines in crude petroleum and 
natural gas production more than offset small increases in the 
mining of metal, stone, and earth minerals and natural gas liquids. 
Utilities increased in March as both electricity and gas 
distribution surpassed February levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although state oil regulatory agencies continue to permit maximum 
production consistent with conservation limitations, district oil-producing states are still pressed to meet all demands for their oil 
and gas. As buyers have not been able to find all of the domestic 
crude they need, some refineries have had to operate at less than 
full capacity. To fill part of the supply gap, Persian Gulf oil was 
imported into Texas and, for the first time, piped inland to be 
refined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seasonally adjusted total employment in the five district states 
rose in March for the ninth consecutive month. Nevertheless, the 
monthly increase in the labor force outpaced the employment growth, 
and the unemployment rate edged up to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent 
in February. Both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing employment rose 
in March as significant increases were reported in finance, 
construction, transportation and public utilities, and government 
services. Mining was the only industry group to show a decline. All 
industries reported year-to-year employment gains.
      </p>
      <p>
       The value of construction contracts awarded in the five district 
states rose sharply in March after falling slightly in February. 
While all three major types of construction increased, 
nonresidential building showed the largest gain, reaching a record 
high. The cumulative value of contracts awarded through March of 
this year reached a level over 17 percent higher than the 
corresponding period last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of department stores in the district continued to rise above 
year-ago levels in April. Cumulative sales for the first four months 
of the year were significantly above the level for the corresponding 
period last year in all five metropolitan areas for which data are 
regularly published. The total number of new automobile 
registrations for the four largest metropolitan areas of Texasâ€”Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonioâ€”rose sharply in March 
over February's level, as Houston and San Antonio reported increases 
of more than 40 percent. Cumulative new car registrations through 
March were over one-fifth higher than in 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weather continues to slow all agricultural activities in the 
Eleventh District. Field preparation and planting activities have 
been severely limited and the situation is becoming critical. Cotton 
planting is barely under way in Texas and Louisiana, a situation 
much different from this time last year, when about one-third of the 
planting in these two states had been completed. Soybean, sorghum, 
and rice plantings are also lagging. Widespread livestock losses due 
to the severe weather have also been reported, and Arizona has had 
numerous losses from poisonous weeds. However, the number of cattle 
and calves on feed in the four western states on April 1 was still 
nearly one-fifth larger than a year ago.
