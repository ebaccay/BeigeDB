      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic expansion continues to accelerate in the Southeast, despite 
  some lingering soft spots. Auto sales, department store sales, and 
  tourist spending are strong. Construction activity is reviving in 
  some areas of the Southeast but remains feeble in much of Florida. 
  Manufacturing activity is still mixed. Purchasing agents report only 
  a slight tendency to rebuild inventories. The persistent rise in 
  mortgage delinquencies may have stabilized. In agriculture, soybean 
  and rice growers face unencouraging prospects, while the outlook for 
  cotton growers and livestock producers has improved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consumption spending remains strong. Reports of motor vehicle sales 
  indicate continuing strong gains from last year, concentrated to a 
  high degree in the larger, fully equipped models. Small car sales, 
  including most imported models, remain weak and inventories are top 
  heavy. Dealers report improved profits. The uniformity of these 
  reports is impressive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most general merchandise retailers report continuing strength in 
  their sales. Some report that they are rebuilding inventories. 
  Despite limited indications of softness in February, vigorous sales 
  are expected during and after Easter. Housewares manufacturers 
  indicate strong sales of nondurable items during January and low 
  retail inventories; in addition, manufacturers' inventories are 
  depleted and many items are back ordered.
       </p>
       <p>
        A strong tourist season is in progress, according to directors' 
  reports from Mississippi, Louisiana, and Florida. Hotel and motel 
  occupancy has increased, fully occupied hotels in some areas have 
  been providing accommodations in conference rooms, and rental cars 
  are scarce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revival in the construction industry appears to be beginning. The 
  market for construction equipment in Alabama has been strong in 
  recent weeks, because contractors and builders expect a strong 
  housing market in the coming year. Residential construction gains in 
  Alabama are expected to continue. In commercial construction, bids 
  are being solicited for an increased number of contracts. In some 
  areas, new residential developments are under way. In Louisiana, 
  increased mortgage lending is reported. Home construction has 
  increased, and better quality apartment units are completely 
  occupied. Construction of previously dormant projects is resuming in 
  several areas, and existing apartments are being renovated. A major 
  Atlanta real estate firm expects to begin new condominium 
  construction this fall, but construction activity in south Florida 
  remains very weak.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conditions in manufacturing are varied. The mobile-home industry has 
  felt an increase in sales, production, and employment during the 
  past two months after reductions spanning two years. In Georgia, 
  production declined from 76,000 units in 1973 to 13,000 units in 
  1975. A large number of mobile-home plants are reportedly for sale 
  and others are in limbo. Production at a major tire company plant 
  has shifted from a five- to a six- day week; however, this increase 
  has been caused by strike hedging. Continued demand increases are 
  reported throughout the paper industry, accompanied by price 
  increases and expansions of facilities. Lumber demand continues to 
  improve in the Southeast, with the exceptions of south Florida and 
  Atlanta; prices continue to rise. Orders are increasing for lumber 
  used for veneers and furniture manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel production is down, reflecting a dearth of orders. Metal 
  fabricators likewise report reduced sales volume; some also indicate 
  excessive inventories. A manufacturer of railroad rolling stock has 
  reduced its labor force from 3,200 to 1,500 as a result of sharply 
  reduced demand for coal cars. Employment is expected to decline 
  further, as present contracts are completed. Part of the reduction 
  in demand reflects improved management of rolling stock using 
  computer-based methods.
       </p>
       <p>
        A survey of Georgia purchasing agents conducted in late January and 
  early February indicates little tendency to restock. The same level 
  of raw material inventories was reported by 90 percent, while the 
  remainder reported larger inventories. Finished goods inventories 
  were stable for a large majority, while some noted growth in stocks. 
  There is little evidence of capacity tightness, as order backlogs 
  are reported constant or shrinking by all but 8 percent. However, 
  lead times allowed on purchases have lengthened slightly for the 
  second consecutive month, while some agents report slower deliveries 
  of goods purchased.
       </p>
       <p>
        An insurance company reports that delinquencies on its mortgage 
  portfolio continue to run at record levels. However, an essentially 
  stable rate during the past three months brought the rate in January 
  down from the peak level of January 1975. This is only the second 
  decline on a year-to-year basis in the past seventeen months; most 
  months during this period have produced substantial increases.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the agricultural sector, developments are mixed. Prospects for 
  soybean producers are dimmed by steady price declines, growing 
  imports of vegetable oil, and the likelihood of increasing soybean 
  acreage in Brazil. A substantial shift of acreage to cotton 
  production is expected to result. Rice farmers presently face 
  reduced prices and excessive supplies as a result of less 
  restrictive Government-support programs and reduced distribution of 
  supplies under aid programs. The juice yield of Florida's orange 
  crop has been cut somewhat by adverse weather conditions. Despite 
  these less favorable aspects, cattle producers are looking forward 
  to firming prices and better financial returns, although recent 
  increases in the number of cattle moving to market have lowered 
  prices. This development probably reflects changes in cattle-grading 
  procedures. Federal Land Bank personnel in Georgia report brisk loan 
  demand and steady or increasing agricultural land prices.
