      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Comments from our directors and from other business executives 
  suggest that economic activity is still declining. They indicated 
  that although there are scattered signs of recovery in some 
  industries, inventory liquidation will be heavy again this quarter. 
  Conditions in the industrial sector are mixed with some firms 
  continuing to produce at high rates, others beginning to recover, 
  and some continuing to experience weak or declining demand. The 
  decline in residential construction appears to have ended and a 
  moderate recovery is under way. S&amp;Ls, however, are being cautious in 
  their mortgage lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales in Cleveland rebounded last month from a sharply 
  depressed level in March. (Some purchases in March were postponed 
  because consumers believed the Ohio sales tax on motor vehicles 
  might be suspended for a time.) Nonautomotive retail sales have held 
  steady, according to a director with a national retail concern. He 
  does not expect tax rebates to create a significant surge in 
  consumer demand. Another director in the consumer entertainment 
  business said motion picture revenues are very good and per capita 
  expenditures in amusement parks are up 28 percent from 1974. All of 
  the increase reflects discretionary spending rather than higher gate 
  fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing agents in Cleveland and our own monthly survey of 
  manufacturers indicate the rate of decline in new orders, 
  production, and employment slowed during April. However, inventory 
  liquidation proceeded at a faster rate than in the first quarter. 
  Firms anticipate a continued high rate of inventory reduction in 
  May. There is evidence of further abatement in inflation. The 
  percent of purchasing agents paying lower prices exceeded the 
  percent paying higher prices for the second consecutive month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Market conditions for producers of capital goods and consumer goods 
  are mixed. Demand for some types of capital goods continues to be 
  very strong and a few previously depressed industries are beginning 
  to recover, but conditions in some industries appear to be growing 
  worse. Generally, firms producing materials, equipment, and 
  machinery for coal mining, air pollution control, oil country goods, 
  drilling rigs, rail cars, pipelines, and gas storage tanks are 
  enjoying strong demand. District firms also report good sales of 
  heavy duty power transmission components, but they caution that 
  there may be more deferments, cancellations, and declining orders 
  from major electric utilities due to uncertainties in the industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs of improvement among auto producers and suppliers are 
  spreading, as some laid-off workers continue to be recalled. 
  Automotive tire sales have started to improve, and industry sources 
  say a massive adjustment in tire stocks has occurred in recent 
  months. A director in the rubber and plastics business said 
  inventories at his company and among its retailers are approaching 
  normal levels; production is expected to increase soon. Chemical 
  shipments have begun to recover according to one major firm. A large 
  paper company and an appliance producer recalled some laid-off 
  employees and lengthened the workweek. An industrial machinery firm 
  reports that orders are starting to turn up, though slowly. The 
  nation's leading machine tool producer recently received its first 
  orders for machine tools from China, and it has been receiving large 
  orders from Mideast and Eastern European countries.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the less encouraging side, two major machine tool builders in 
  Cleveland report no pickup in new orders, and they are continuing to 
  work down their backlogs. One firm experienced a new wave of 
  cancellations in April. A top executive in the heavy-duty truck 
  industry reports that the industry is in its worst sales slump in 
  many years. In Cleveland, a manufacturer of large trucks previously 
  cut output from 60 units a day to 40 units. Now it is producing 24 
  units a day, following a recent three-week shutdown. Six hundred 
  additional workers were laid off early in May. Truck and bus tire 
  shipments are very weak, and further layoffs will likely occur in 
  this segment of the tire industry. In central Ohio, a large firm is 
  eliminating its recreational vehicle line and permanently reducing 
  its work force by 1,500. Bankers in the area are extremely 
  concerned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large and small steel companies continue to lay off workers, 
  temporarily suspend some operations, and reduce their workweeks. 
  Heavy liquidation of steel inventories by steel users is in process. 
  Steel mills, however, are still rebuilding their own inventories. 
  Economists from several steel firms say production should begin to 
  recover in the fourth quarter, with demand from auto and appliance 
  producers expected to lead the recovery. A large steel firm in 
  Youngstown will furlough 2,000 workers for five weeks beginning June 
  8 while new equipment is being installed.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of our directors strongly emphasized the need for policies 
  to stimulate capital spending. In their view, the recent 
  liberalization of the investment tax credit is of only limited help. 
  The directors believe that tax rules limiting depreciation to 
  original cost rather than replacement cost, and long depreciation 
  schedules, are inhibiting growth of the nation's plant capacity and 
  will lead to new shortages. Several directors in energy-related 
  businesses said they were certain that there would be severe energy 
  shortages in the 1980s.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among other comments from our directors, a university president said 
  jobs are very scarce this year for all except the few best 
  graduates. A director from a large bank in Cincinnati commented on 
  the large increase in job applications at his bank.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the construction sector, nonresidential building remains 
  depressed, but housing is beginning to edge up. Mortgage lending 
  activity by district S&amp;Ls increased in April, following a very 
  sluggish first quarter. Many S&amp;L officials believe interest rates 
  will rise sharply by year-end and, therefore, are not aggressively 
  seeking mortgage loans. Net savings inflows showed some signs of 
  slowing in April.
