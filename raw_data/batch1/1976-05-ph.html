      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District continues to expand. The 
retail sector shows healthy gains in sales, and manufacturers report 
increases in new orders and shipments although the increases are 
less widespread than last month. At the same time, employment and 
the average workweek in manufacturing show moderate gains while 
inventories in this sector are unchanged. The longer-term outlook in 
manufacturing is for additional expansion. Bankers indicate that 
consumer loans are increasing but business loans are sagging. 
Businessmen continue to report rising prices, and inflationary 
pressures are essentially the same as last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to this month's business outlook survey 
  report additional improvement in business over last month. Of the 
  businessmen surveyed, one-half report a higher level of general 
  business activity—slightly fewer than last month. Specific gains in 
  new orders and shipments are indicated, although the reported 
  increases are not as widespread as they were in April. One-third of 
  the firms in the current survey report increases in new orders and 4 
  out of 10 indicate higher levels of shipments. Last month, by 
  comparison, more than half of the respondents reported gains in each 
  of these categories. Manufacturing employment is another "plus" this 
  month. The factory workweek is somewhat longer, and work forces are 
  higher at 17 percent of the businesses surveyed. While this gain in 
  employment appears modest, the job picture is brighter than it has 
  been for quite some time. Only 4 percent of the respondents report 
  employment cutbacks since last month and this "net gain" of 13 
  percentage points is the highest since October 1973. One major area 
  showing no increase is inventories which are basically unchanged 
  from last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in manufacturing for the next two quarters is optimistic 
  with 8 out of 10 respondents projecting expansion. New orders and 
  shipments are expected to be higher by fall and increases in 
  inventories and employment are also projected. Fifty percent of 
  those polled expect to add to their inventories, 45 percent plan to 
  hire additional workers and 30 percent anticipate lengthening the 
  average workweek. In addition, 4 out of 10 respondents plan to hike 
  their spending for plant and equipment—about the same as in the 
  three previous surveys.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the price front, manufacturers report paying and receiving higher 
  prices this month, but there is no significant change in the 
  distribution of responses from last month. Forty-seven percent of 
  the respondents report paying more for their supplies currently and 
  19 percent have raised the price tags for their finished products. 
  The outlook is for additional price increases in the next six 
  months. Eighty percent of those surveyed expect to be paying more 
  for their inputs over the period and 70 percent anticipate charging 
  more for the products they sell.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail executives continue to report strong sales and the outlook 
  for the rest of this year is optimistic. The majority of retailers 
  report that current sales are more than 10 percent above year-ago 
  levels; this is several percentage points higher than their 
  forecasts for this period. Reports are mixed, however, on the 
  components of total sales volume. One retailer notes that, "apparel 
  carried the day" in the most recent sales period while another 
  labels apparel sales as "slightly disappointing." A carpet 
  manufacturer in the District indicates a noticeable softening in 
  orders from retailers since late February, and merchants in the area 
  confirm this slump although one mentions a slight pickup recently. 
  Area retailers are optimistic about sales prospects over the next 
  several months. One executive looks for a big lift in the summer 
  from bicentennial tourists. Her store has already run several 
  bicentennial-related promotions which boosted floor traffic, and 
  many additional promotions of this type are planned through the 
  summer. There is general agreement among retailers that price 
  increases are "modest" and no recent attempt by suppliers to push 
  through large price hikes is reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers report that total loan volume continues to be soft. 
  Consumer loans are up but business loans continue to sag. Consumer 
  credit card loans are reported to be increasing, and one banker 
  notes a strong promotion of auto loans at his bank. Commercial and 
  industrial loans are falling off with one banker noting a $35 
  million runoff in the last month. All of the bankers surveyed 
  attribute the weakness in business loans to improved business 
  liquidity but most expect pressure on operating funds to intensify. 
  As one banker put it, "I hear more and more talk that increasing 
  demand will require additions to inventories and this will increase 
  the demand for short-term financing." The consensus among bankers is 
  that loan demand will pick up sometime in the third quarter of this 
  year.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, short-term interest rates are expected to climb 
  gradually from this point on. There are no reported plans to lower 
  the prime rate. One executive feels it would generate little 
  additional loan volume, but notes that loans at his bank might be 
  made at less-than-prime rates if customers requested such an 
  arrangement. By year-end the prime rate is expected to be in the 7 
  1/2-8 percent range with Fed funds trading around 6 1/2-7 percent. 
  In general, bankers in the District express satisfaction with the 
  pace of economic recovery. There is little concern at this time 
  about the danger of the economy overheating, and the anticipated 
  rise in interest rates through the end of 1976 is not expected to 
  put a damper on the expansion.
