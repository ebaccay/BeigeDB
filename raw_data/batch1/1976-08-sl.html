      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eighth District businessmen report that business activity is 
  generally good. The pace of the recovery, however, has slowed 
  somewhat in the last two months. Inventory demand has apparently 
  slackened, and retailers note some slowing in sales. Also, 
  manufacturing firms are experiencing some leveling-off in sales, and 
  recent increases in manufacturing employment have been less than 
  increases recorded earlier in the year. Home building, which made 
  substantial gains earlier in the year, has tended to level off in 
  recent weeks. Deposits at thrift institutions continue to increase 
  but at a more modest pace than earlier in the year, and mortgage 
  interest rates have inched up in recent weeks. Despite the slower 
  pace of the recovery, most District businessmen remain optimistic 
  and report a preference for this slower rate of recovery rather than 
  for more stimulative actions which lead to further inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of consumer spending has apparently slowed somewhat 
  recently. Some department store representatives noted that their 
  sales were essentially unchanged from June to July; however, they 
  were substantially above year-ago levels in both months. July sales 
  of air conditioners and other consumer durables were reported to be 
  good, but overall sales of such items for the year to date have been 
  somewhat less than anticipated. The July gains in big-ticket items 
  were offset by reduced sales of nondurable items. Automobile sales 
  remain strong, though the rate of gain has stabilized.
     </p>
     <p>
      Gains in manufacturing orders have decelerated somewhat in recent 
  weeks from the pace of early 1976. A representative of the paints 
  and coating industry stated that orders have generally risen since 
  the beginning of the year, though a slowing in the growth rate is 
  now apparent. Manufacturers of home construction items reported that 
  sales, while above year-ago levels, have not increased recently, 
  reflecting the less than anticipated increase in housing starts. A 
  major aircraft manufacturer reported a mild decline in sales in the 
  first half of the year, though the backlog of orders is higher than 
  a year ago. Lower commercial aircraft deliveries were partially 
  offset by accelerating work on Government contracts. A producer of 
  conveyer products for the foundry, sawmill, and rubber industries 
  reports that new orders are substantially behind 1975 and 1974 and 
  that no recovery is foreseen at this point. On the other hand, a 
  representative of a major chemical firm reported that sales have 
  continued up at a moderate rate among most product lines. Perhaps 
  the most optimistic prospects are in the automobile sector. A 
  spokesman for this industry in the St. Louis area was generally 
  optimistic about the sales prospects for the new-model year. 
  Reflecting this optimism, two plants have announced major increases 
  in employment and planned output. Overall, employment in the 
  District has increased less than seasonally in recent months. 
  Manufacturing employment has continued to make some gains in several 
  areas of the District, but the increases were more than offset by 
  declines in the nonmanufacturing sector. Unemployment rates, 
  however, continue downward in most of the District and are generally 
  below the United States unemployment rate. Some nonmetropolitan 
  areas reported virtual full employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Growth of home construction has slowed recently. New home sales in 
  the St. Louis area are reported to have been fairly steady in recent 
  months, though not spectacular. Multifamily construction in the St. 
  Louis area remains near a standstill. Several commercial and 
  industrial projects are under way in various parts of the District, 
  but one contractor reports a lack of new projects coming on stream.
     </p>
     <p>
      The slower rate of deposit growth reported earlier at savings and 
  loan associations has continued in recent weeks. Offerings of 
  attractive yields on Treasury bonds probably are drawing some funds 
  from thrift institutions. The deceleration in the growth of thrift 
  deposits has encouraged some savings and loan associations to make 
  their certificates of deposit (CDs) more attractive by reducing the 
  maturity of CDs for a given yield. This policy is a reversal of 
  actions earlier this year, which tended to reduce the attractiveness 
  of CDs. Mortgage lenders report some upward pressures on mortgage 
  interest rates in the past month. The dominant rate is now at 8 3/4 
  percent in the St. Louis area. Business loan demand at commercial 
  banks remains sluggish, according to St. Louis bank representatives, 
  and bank lending rates have tended to decline.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop yields have generally improved as a result of scattered 
  rainfall in recent weeks. In some areas, particularly in Missouri, 
  corn and soybean crops have been severely damaged by drought 
  conditions. Reports from several other areas, however, indicate that 
  crops are in excellent condition. Recent rains in some areas have 
  enhanced yield prospects, especially of late plantings. Cotton yield 
  prospects, however, remain poor, reflecting earlier adverse weather 
  conditions.
