      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 10, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Most of our Redbook contacts report another month of generally 
expansionary activity, clouded by only a few signs of downturn and 
substantial damage by heavy rains and severe weather. Although some 
categories of loan demand remain strong, total loan growth is 
showing some weakness. An increase in large CDs has boosted deposits 
in recent weeks, with bankers saying that expectations of lower 
interest rates are figuring importantly in their management of CDs. 
Recent floods have heavily damaged property and put district 
agriculture off schedule. Fuel shortages have not yet hurt 
agriculture significantly, although concern continues. New car 
dealers are enjoying another successful autumn of new model 
introductions, with big cars selling better than expected, but not 
as well as compacts. Managers of department stores doubt that retail 
sales will grow much next year, but most of them are enjoying the 
way in which each month this year comes in better than last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       A very mixed picture of loan demand continues to emerge from 
interviews with Tenth District bankers. Some report that their 
volume of business loans is constrained only by their ability to 
raise money, while others notice a slackening of demand in recent 
weeks. Inventory financing is an especially strong source of demand, 
as price and sales increases necessitate carrying greater nominal 
values of inventories as suppliers tighten their normal credit 
terms. High farm prices also have pushed up the demand for loans to 
cover agricultural inventories. Pressures on rural banks from this 
source are being transmitted to correspondent banks in urban centers 
through requests for loan participations. Consumer installment 
borrowing is generally considered no stronger than seasonal, with 
loans for car purchases somewhat weaker than a year ago. Loans to 
financial intermediaries have increased, as savings and loans borrow 
to offset some disintermediation. Deposits have been growing rapidly 
over the last few weeks, with an increase in large CDs making up for 
a lackluster performance in consumer time deposits. Nearly all banks 
are attempting to shorten their CD maturities in anticipation of a 
decline in interest rates. Most say that the higher reserve 
requirements are having little or no effect on their CD management 
policies, but a few are increasing fed funds borrowings rather than 
locking in expensive CD money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heavy rains throughout much of the district have temporarily halted 
winter wheat planting and the fall harvest. Wheat planting is behind 
normal but few people seem overly concerned because, as one grain 
spokesman said, "Somehow farmers always get their wheat planted." In 
Kansas, considerable flooding over a wide area, accompanied by 
tornadoes, resulted in heavy losses of property, equipment, and 
crops. Soil erosion has been the major problem, with some fields 
losing most of the top soil that had been prepared for winter wheat. 
Much of the applied fertilizer was also washed away, and it may be 
impossible to replace because of the current shortage. While 
individual operators have suffered severe setbacks, the impact of 
the flood on total U. S. crop production—both now and next year—will be rather insignificant. This is reflected in the grain markets 
where very little nervousness exists. One comment was that if there 
is a fuel shortage, and if there is more wet weather, and if the 
wheat doesn't get planted and the fall crops harvested, then the 
"bulls" will take action and bid up market prices. But at the 
moment, the markets are relatively calm. Fears over a significant 
shortage of propane for agricultural purposes have been largely 
dispelled by the new mandatory allocation program. However, with 
allotments set equal to last year's supplies, some spot shortages 
are expected, as larger crops lead to larger propane requirements. 
There continues to be some concern over gasoline supplies, but the 
problem is not regarded to be as serious as the propane situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rising gasoline prices and closed service stations do not seem to 
have hurt sales of new model autos. Even in Denver, where the 
gasoline shortage has been especially acute, new cars are selling as 
well as they did last year. Compacts are the hottest, but some 
dealers report that their full-sized models are being well received. 
Most dealers hope that this year will be as good as last year; few 
expect it to be better.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store managers throughout the district say that their 
sales are continuing strong. Dollar sales at all reporting stores 
rose this September over last September, and increases ranged up to 
15 percent. Sales of durables as well as nondurables apparently are 
still increasing, although a couple of store managers expect this 
happy circumstance to end soon. Most managers expect a good fall and 
Christmas season. Looking ahead to next year, opinion is divided. 
Some store managers see sales rising at about the rate of inflation, 
while others expect slower growth. Inventories are being kept at 
last year's levels, or slightly above. While the lead times required 
by suppliers are still very long for some items, the store managers 
say that their inventories are "as budgeted."
