     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall picture that emerges from the views expressed by Second 
  District directors and other business leaders who were contacted 
  recently is one of a further moderation in the rate of the economic 
  decline, if not of an actual turnaround. Retail sales rose strongly 
  in May, further progress has been made toward reducing inventories, 
  and district crop prospects look good. The auto and construction 
  industries continue to display weakness, however, and the demand for 
  bank credit remains soft.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retail sales picture brightened considerably over the past 
  month. According to a survey by a local newspaper, sales at major 
  New York City department stores, which had been running below last 
  year's levels during the first four months of this year, were nearly 
  4 percent higher this May than in May 1974, while retail sales for 
  the entire metropolitan area were 5.4 percent higher than a year 
  ago. According to an official of a trade association, New York City 
  area merchants have become markedly more optimistic. On the basis of 
  his contacts with local retail firms, he reported that, while the 
  May increase was in good part accounted for by increased apparel 
  sales, sales of major appliances and furniture had also increased. 
  He felt that the improved retail sales atmosphere was due largely to 
  a strengthening in consumer confidence, with the tax rebates playing 
  only a minor part. The president of a nationwide department store 
  chain felt that consumer purchases of durable goods would likely 
  increase as economic recovery takes hold, a sentiment shared by 
  other respondents. The Buffalo Branch directors reported strong 
  retail sales in western New York in May, in some areas as high as 15 
  percent above a year ago, and expressed optimism that consumer 
  spending would remain strong at least through early summer. The 
  respondents, however, were generally cautious regarding the near-term outlook for automobile sales. Several businessmen expressed the 
  view that auto sales might not improve significantly until the 
  introduction of the 1976 models. The president of a large steel firm 
  stated that he was cautious regarding auto sales, but he noted that 
  millions of autos continue to be scrapped yearly and that a "hidden" demand must be building up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding inventories, the retailers reported a substantial decline 
  from high levels at the turn of the year, although the president of 
  the department store chain mentioned above felt that durable goods 
  inventories remained high. The president of a steel corporation 
  reported that his firm was reducing its stocks on hand and that the 
  firm's customers have rapidly reduced their inventories, which 
  should be at "normal" levels by the beginning of July. The president 
  of a nonferrous metals producer, on the other hand, observed that, 
  despite inventory liquidation, stocks of metals other than steel 
  remain at high levels. Among senior officials in the chemicals 
  industry, several reported inventories under control, although one 
  felt that his firm's stocks were still too high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Turning to agriculture, a Buffalo Branch director with farming 
  interests reported that spring weather conditions have been ideal 
  for crop planting. If the favorable weather conditions continue 
  through harvest time, the prospects are for very high yields in most 
  crops. The high yields are expected to result in lower prices in 
  general, except for certain vegetable crops where the carry-over 
  from last year was particularly low. Beef prices are expected to 
  remain strong, but lower prices are anticipated for eggs and poultry 
  products.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the darker side, none of the respondents expressing views on the 
  subject were optimistic over the near-term outlook for the 
  construction industry. Among others, a senior official of a large 
  New York City area savings bank reported that, as a result of a 
  large inflow of deposits in recent months, his bank had much more 
  funds available for mortgages than there was demand for such funds, 
  and he did not expect a turnaround in construction activity for at 
  least four to five months. Some observers noted the recent tendency 
  of depositors to shun higher-yielding certificates of deposit in 
  favor of regular savings accounts, suggesting that they may be 
  building up liquidity for withdrawal in the near term. The Buffalo 
  Branch directors generally felt that the 5 percent tax credit and 
  the large inflow of savings deposits had not provided a stimulus to 
  residential construction sufficient to overcome the depressing 
  effects of the uncertainties arising from current economic 
  conditions and high construction costs. They expected a gradual 
  recovery in the housing sector but felt a quick return to the high 
  levels of 1972 and 1973 does not seem likely.
