      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 12, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       According to Second District directors and other business leaders 
who were recently contacted, there has as yet been little easing of 
materials shortages and capacity limitations. The business capital 
spending outlook on balance remains strong, but the District 
residential construction picture appears bleak. High financing 
costs, as well as shortages, may be inhibiting inventory investment 
in some sectors, and little evidence of excessive inventory 
accumulation was noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most respondents perceived little or no indications that shortages 
and capacity limitations were easing up. Among others, the president 
of a multinational chemical corporation reported continuous 
shortages and capacity limitations in his industry, while a senior 
official of a nationwide chain of department stores noted that many 
items were still not available. An official of a large paper firm 
reported that while his firm might be obtaining an adequate supply 
of raw materials, the production capacity situation in the paper 
industry was still very tight and his firm was behind in shipping 
its products to its customers. The president of a large electrical 
equipment distributing firm, on the basis of conversations with his 
firm's suppliers, saw no easing as yet in the supply and capacity 
picture. On the other hand, the chairman of a large New York City 
bank reported that some basic materials have become more easily 
available since price controls were removed, and the president of a 
nonferrous metals product manufacturing concern reported some 
softening in the copper and brass markets, which he associated with 
the current weakness in the auto and construction industries. Both 
respondents, however, noted that many materials shortages still 
persist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responses to a question about business capital spending were mixed, 
but most of the respondents felt that financial market conditions 
had not yet caused firms to cancel or cut back their capital 
spending plans, at least in dollar amounts. The New York City banker 
mentioned above thus stated that he was not aware of any reduced 
capital spending plans, while the retailer reported that his firm 
was upgrading its capital spending plans to take into consideration 
the rise in construction costs. The official of the paper firm 
reported that his firm, and probably the paper industry in general, 
was embarking on a three- to five-year expansion program involving 
significantly higher outlays than had been expected in recent years, 
while the president of a diversified financial institution 
characterized the demand for capital as "still good." On the other 
hand, the president of a large New York City bank stated that some 
of his bank's business customers reported that their firms were 
cutting their expansion programs in physical terms although not in 
dollar terms, and the chairman of another large New York-based 
financial institution noted "some cooling of enthusiasm" regarding 
expansion programs. The president of the nonferrous metal products 
concern stated that his firms had become "definitely more 
conservative" with respect to capital expenditures in the light of 
current financial market conditions; and while another director was 
not aware of reduced capital spending plans solely as a result of 
financial market conditions, he felt this could become a factor for 
some electric utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were suggestions that current high, short-term interest rates 
may be, as stated by a New York City banker, acting as a 
"restraining influence" on firms' inventory policies. The president 
of the nonferrous metal products firm reported that the high cost of 
carrying inventories had induced his firm to institute tighter 
inventory controls. The great majority of the respondents commenting 
on the inventory situation felt that there has been no excessive 
inventory accumulation as yet. Among others, the president of an 
electric equipment distributing firm reported that his firm's sales 
had risen more rapidly than its inventories, and he felt this was 
also true for many of its customers. Other respondents, including 
the retailer and the paper company official, cited the shortage of 
some items as another factor inhibiting inventory accumulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second District residential construction remains weak. The president 
of a large New York City savings bank cited the continued loss of 
deposits by thrift institutions to higher-yielding Treasury 
securities and, in his view even more significant, the high cost of 
construction with new housing not selling well. An official of a 
savings bank trade association reported that savings banks in the 
New York City area had continued to suffer net outflows of deposits 
in May and that the savings and loan associations had probably 
undergone a similar experience. He saw no evidence of a turnaround 
in residential construction at this moment. The respondents in 
general felt that the Administration's new housing program was 
likely to have little effect on the housing industry. In the view of 
the savings bank association official, it might be a "cushion" to a 
further decline in residential construction rather than a stimulus.
