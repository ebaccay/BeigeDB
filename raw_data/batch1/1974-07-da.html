      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 10, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       The majority of our Directors believe that monetary policies are not 
sufficiently restrictive to bring the inflation under control within 
a reasonable time frame. A sizable minority, however, are very 
concerned over the present high level of interest rates and the 
difficulties in obtaining financing for productive capital 
expenditures. They believe some form of credit allocation other than 
by higher rates will be necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, most industrialists in the Eleventh District have not 
yet made significant revisions in their capital spending plans for 
1974 in response to tight credit conditions, rising prices, and 
material shortages. The firms interviewed covered a wide range of 
industries and included companies financing capital expenditures 
wholly from internal funds as well as those heavily dependent on 
external sources. Corporate executives who are relying on debt 
financing said they are going ahead with needed improvements since 
they believe "higher interest rates are here to stay." There were no 
cases of stepped-up spending plans in anticipation of rising prices,
or reports of project delays due to shortages of building materials. 
The majority of firms interviewed said capital expenditures for 1974 
will be at roughly the same level as last year. However, big 
increases in spending are planned by the oil field machinery and 
public utility industries. Two large utilities in Texas, for 
example, are spending about 30 percent more this year on plant and 
equipment, despite the fact that both claim internal financing will 
account for only 40 percent of the total funds required.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tight credit markets are having a substantial impact on the long 
term expenditures of small businesses in the District. Consultants 
to small businesses in Dallas and Houston report that capital 
expenditures by their clients are sharply lower. Many of these 
firms, heavily dependent on bank loans, are having difficulty 
obtaining financing. Moreover, when loans are available, the cost 
has been prohibitive. For the most part, smaller businesses have 
chosen to make do with their present equipment and facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A survey of leading savings and loan associations in the state 
reveals that large deposit losses are continuing, resulting in 
further tightening of the mortgage market. The most pessimistic 
accounts come from Houston where the inventory of unsold new homes 
has climbed to 6-8 months' sales, as compared to the normal 2-3 
months' sales. That city's two largest S&amp;Ls have stopped 
accepting new commitments and are only making additional loans to 
cover outstanding commitments. Although the rate of net deposit 
outflow at these institutions slowed in June, managers say a 
resumption of loan activity is impossible until they experience a 
positive savings flow. A more representative response came from a 
financial holding company with affiliated savings and loan 
associations across the state, where lending activity is down 
"drastically" from the first of the year, but financing is still 
available at 9-1/2 percentâ€”the prevailing rate in Texas on 80-percent conventional loans. The high offering rates necessary to 
attract deposits will hinder any substantial reduction in mortgage 
rates. For example, one lender reports he is becoming "locked in" at 
a minimum rate of 9 percent since most of his deposit inflows in 
recent months have been in the form of 7-1/2 percent certificates, 
and he estimates that a 1-1/2 percent margin is necessary to operate 
at a profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Depressed cattle prices are having a substantial impact on the 
ability of cattlemen to repay loans at banks in cattle feeding 
areas. A recent survey of such banks revealed that one-fourth of 
them were taking losses on loans for cattle feeding, but none were 
in any danger financially. These banks, with deposits ranging from 
$15 million to $30 million, described their losses as "big," 
"substantial," and "sizable."
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the rest of the banks contacted reported no current losses 
on loans for cattle feeding, several expressed doubt as to how long 
they could continue under current market conditions without 
experiencing some losses. A very pessimistic outlook for the 
repayment of some working cattle loans was shared by most of the 
bankers interviewed. They felt that the most critical period for 
repayment of loans will be during the next several months. One 
banker anticipates that several banks that he is familiar with will 
be under severe financial stress by fall unless conditions change 
markedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attitude of bankers toward their cattle feeding customers is 
generally accommodative. Most expressed a desire to stay with their 
established customers through the current depressed cattle market. 
However, one banker felt he would have increasing difficulty 
discounting loans made to cattle feeders because of the low equity 
positions of these feeders. All bankers interviewed indicated they 
were not "calling in" any loans but several have advised some 
customers to sell a portion of the cattle they now have on feed. A 
few bankers are also asking for additional collateral on old loans 
in anticipation of losses. Many loan officers are taking a very 
conservative attitude regarding new loans for placement of cattle on 
feed and will require much more stringent terms on these loans.
