      Beige Book Report: New York

       April 12, 1972
      </strong>

       The directors of the New York Bank and the Buffalo Branch in general 
felt Phase II still was having a favorable, if not fully adequate, 
impact on current economic developments, and that the resignation of 
the four labor members would not cripple the Pay Board. Most of the 
directors, as well as the retailers who were contacted, continue to 
be moderately optimistic, on balance, about the retail sales 
outlook. Views expressed by the directors, however, on the whole 
suggested that some cooling of the housing boom may be in the 
offing. According to most responses of the directors and of a number 
of bank officials, business loan demand has continued sluggish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the directors at both the Buffalo Branch and the head 
office were not especially enthusiastic over the impact so far of 
Phase II, they generally agreed that the President's program was 
having some effect in restraining inflation. Those Buffalo Branch 
directors who expressed an opinion agreed that the current situation 
would have been "far worse" without these measures, but they felt 
that more stringent action would probably be needed to bring 
inflation under fuller control. The vice-president of a large 
upstate firm pointed to the slowing down in the rate of growth of 
nonfood prices so far this year, and similar sentiments were 
expressed by the president of an upstate bank—a head office 
director. The chairman of the board of a large New York City bank 
felt that Phase II had been fairly effective, and he also remarked 
that the Pay Board had done a "fairly creditable job" in view of the 
"nasty problems" it had faced. Much the same view was expressed by 
the president of a large nationwide manufacturing concern. All but 
one of the directors who commented on the subject felt that the 
departure of the four labor members would not cripple the Pay Board. 
Indeed, some of the Buffalo Branch directors thought that this move 
might result in smoother Board operation. A New Jersey banker, 
however, reported that his staff foresaw more strikes and a 
"complete breakdown" of the efforts of the Pay Board.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent consumer spending picture has been somewhat blurred by 
the early Easter holiday, which tended to boost March sales, 
possibly at the expense of April sales. In any event, the directors 
and the retailers who were contacted still present a moderately 
optimistic picture, particularly with respect to the coming months. 
It is true that the president of a Rochester department store, a 
head office director, characterized current retail sales in that 
area as only "fair." And Buffalo Branch directors reported only 
slightly better performance in western New York this Easter period 
relative to last year. In each case, however, these directors said 
that businessmen in their area expected sales to pick up as the year 
progressed. An official of a high price, high quality New York City 
department store, who last month had reported a spurt in business by 
his firm in early March, was more restrained this month. He noted 
that while sales were still picking up, the rise was only "moderate" 
and smaller than had been hoped. However, he still remained 
cautiously optimistic, and he felt that 1972 would turn out to be a 
fairly good year, up to his store's expectations and better than 
1971. An official of a nationwide chain of medium-priced stores, on 
the other hand, verged on the exuberant. He reported that his firm's 
business had been picking up smartly, that the increased strength in 
the demand for bigger ticket items he had noted last month continued 
in evidence, and that his firm was "very pleased" and looking for a 
good year. The president of the large nationwide manufacturing 
concern viewed the strength in his firm's corrugated container sales 
as signaling a rise in consumer demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding residential construction, the overall impression emerging 
from the views expressed by the directors was that, on balance, it 
continues strong, but that some flattening-out may be in the offing. 
An upstate banker reported a considerable amount of apartment and 
single-family dwelling construction in his area. A New York City 
banker remarked that a slight rise in the rate of vacancies might 
not be an unfavorable development, as it might tend to reduce upward 
pressures on rents. The senior official of the large upstate firm 
looked for some cooling off of the boom in residential construction 
as a result of a "slight" rise in the rate of vacancies and in 
mortgage rates. Buffalo Branch directors reported some concern on 
the part of builders that supply would soon exceed demand, partly, 
in the case of Rochester, as the result of a number of urban 
development projects now underway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports concerning the strength of business loan demand varied 
somewhat, but, on balance, pointed to continued relative 
sluggishness. On the one hand, the New York City banker-director 
reported that demand at his bank was up to levels experienced in a 
"good year," and an upstate banker-director noted an uptrend of all 
types of loans at his bank in recent weeks. On the other hand, a 
Rochester banker, a Buffalo Branch director, while characterizing 
demand as "fairly good" at his own bank, indicated that reports from 
the Rochester area suggested such demand continues weak. Similarly, 
a New Jersey banker reported no pronounced increase in the demand 
for business loans at his bank. These latter assessments are 
consistent with the results of a special survey of five New York 
City banks and four other District banks: four of the five New York 
City banks reported no, or only seasonal, increases in business 
loans over the past month, as did three of the four out-of-town 
banks. A key reason advanced for this weakness was that business 
generally appeared to be in a fairly liquid position, thus obviating 
the need for bank credit at this time.
