      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A
  steady recovery continues to characterize the business outlook, 
    according to the views expressed by Second District directors and 
    other business leaders who were contacted recently. Consumer 
    spending remains strong; business inventories are down to levels 
    where some rebuilding may be required to keep in line with sales; 
    capital outlays are still sluggish but are generally expected to 
    pick up; and residential construction appears to be strengthening. 
    On the darker side, the District unemployment picture remains bleak.
     </p>
     <p>
      All indications point to continued strength in consumer spending. 
  The president of a nationwide chain of department stores reported 
  that retailers were generally optimistic, 1976 is expected to be a 
  good year and there is nothing on the horizon "that might hurt 
  business this year." He felt that consumers were being less price 
  conscious, and reported that higher price items were selling well. 
  The vice-chairman of a multinational electrical products firm noted 
  strength in the sale of consumer durables, and expected such sales 
  to remain strong throughout 1976. An economist for a multinational 
  nonferrous metal producer noted that despite the stepped up consumer 
  buying, such outlays have not kept up with the rise in consumers' 
  real income, opening prospects for further growth in the pace of 
  consumer spending. Similar sentiments were expressed by several bank 
  economists. Regarding the District retail sales picture, the 
  president of the nationwide chain mentioned above stated that his 
  firm's New York City area stores have been doing well, "as well as 
  anywhere else." While sales at large New York City department stores 
  during March were only about 5 percent above March 1975, in part 
  reflecting the later Easter date this year, area merchants expected 
  sales during the March-April period to substantially exceed those of 
  last year. An upstate banker reported that sales in his area 
  continued strong, while the Buffalo branch directors reported that, 
  after a sluggish start, spring consumer buying in Western New York 
  had "come on strong," especially during the last days of March and 
  early April. Larger retail stores were reported to be doing 
  particularly well.
     </p>
     <p>
      As in recent months, respondents felt that the continued strength in 
  retail sales had found its counterpart in the termination of 
  downward adjustments in business inventories, and in emerging 
  evidence that the rebuilding process was getting underway. Among 
  others, a business economist stated that "retail stocks are 
  obviously too low" as a result of a greater than expected volume of 
  sales, and that manufacturers and wholesalers will also have to be 
  adding to inventories to keep up with sales growth. Another 
  observer, a financial economist, felt that with consumer spending 
  running ahead of expectations, some businessmen found it difficult 
  to avoid a drop below desired levels in their stocks of certain 
  products in strong demand, The consensus, however, was best summed 
  up by the Buffalo branch directors who felt that businessmen have 
  learned to live with lower inventory-to-sales ratios through 
  improved inventory management techniques but that, with mounting 
  confidence in the economic outlook, these businessmen were 
  cautiously rebuilding inventories. These directors expected such 
  rebuilding to accelerate as spending for capital goods increased.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding business capital outlays, several bank economists and 
  other respondents reiterated the view expressed in recent months 
  that these outlays could be expected to pick up as business activity 
  continued to expand. However, as yet, there is no concrete evidence 
  that a significant pickup has gotten underway in this sector. Senior 
  officials of two nationwide retail firms reported that their firms 
  maintained a cautious and "selective" attitude towards the opening 
  of new outlets. The president of a machine-tools producer reported a 
  substantial rise in inquiries by businessmen, but little increase in 
  actual orders. Similarly, the official of the electrical product 
  firm reported heightened interest in bidding, but that this interest 
  has not been translated into "action," and indeed that his firm's 
  backlog of orders for industrial equipment actually was off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports were mixed regarding the current construction picture, but 
  on balance suggested some improvement. Unrented office space in New 
  York City was reported to have declined about 8 percent over the 
  past year. A business economist stated that the current moderate 
  recovery in the housing industry should continue through this year 
  and next, with mortgage money readily available and with demographic 
  pressures and the pent-up-demand for housing built up during the 2 
  years of recession providing momentum for steady gains in housing 
  starts. Similarly, a financial economist pointed to the strong jump 
  in residential contract awards in February as auguring strength in 
  the construction not only of single family homes, but of apartments 
  as well. The Buffalo directors reported that major builders of 
  luxury class homes in Western New York were doing a "brisk 
  business." One director pointed to the increasing demand for 
  building lots as indicating a probable future strengthening of 
  construction and the directors in general felt that the availability 
  of mortgage money in their area was sufficiently adequate to promote 
  substantial further improvement in home building. On the more 
  restrained side, the chairman of a large New York City bank reported 
  that construction of commercial structures and of condominiums 
  continued sluggish and could be expected to remain so over the near 
  term. On the basis of his firm's weak sales of plumbing material, 
  the official of the nonferrous metal firm felt the demand for new 
  homes remained lackluster, while several upstate directors reported 
  continued weakness in the building of low to moderate priced homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District unemployment picture generally remained bleak but there 
  were indications of a slight improvement. The unemployment rate (not 
  seasonally adjusted) for New York City edged down to 12 percent in 
  February from 12.2 percent in January, and for New York State to 
  10.9 percent from 11.1 percent. These rates had continued to 
  increase in January. A director associated with an automotive 
  product firm reported that his firm's output and employment were 
  well ahead of 
  pre-recession levels, reflecting the improved demand 
  for automobiles. The local labor market, however, continues very 
  slack; for example, a major Buffalo area food processor who 
  announced openings for 200 workers received 3,000 job applications 
  on the first day.
