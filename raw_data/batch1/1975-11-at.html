      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A varied economic picture emerges in current reports from the Sixth 
District. Consumers appear to be economizing by changing their 
buying habits. However, retailers expect a strong holiday selling 
season, with the exception of more expensive merchandise. 
Inventories of some retailers may be inadequate should strong growth 
occur in demand. Divergent trends are apparent in recent price 
developments. Production cutbacks are still occurring in certain 
industries, while others are operating at peak capacity. In the 
district's agricultural sector, record numbers of livestock have 
been sold and harvests have progressed rapidly.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Evidence has appeared in several areas of the Sixth District that 
consumers are "trading down" in their purchasing decisions. A large 
furniture company reports a preference for more economical 
furniture. Medium-priced furniture lines appear to be doing 
particularly well. Similarly, apartment dwellers are moving from 
more to less expensive apartments. A large department store, which 
has enjoyed strong sales increases since August, reports that the 
results of its discount operation exceed those for the parent store. 
A major sporting goods retailer reports that good quality 
merchandise of all kinds is selling well but that sales of expensive 
goods are slow. A supermarket chain reports that customers have been 
switching from brand names to less expensive private label products. 
Finally, a nationwide distributor of automotive replacement parts 
attributes a strong sales increase directly to the tendency of 
people to maintain and repair their present cars during periods of 
economic weakness rather than buy new automobiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers, in general, express the opinion that consumers are 
reluctant to purchase big-ticket items. They expect this reluctance 
to continue through the Christmas season. In other types of 
merchandise, retailers expect a strong holiday selling season. 
Retail store inventories are described by several sources as thin. 
Shortages due to cautious inventory rebuilding may result in missed 
sales during the holiday buying season. A representative of one 
major department store believes inventory may be low; that store is 
not poised for a strong business expansion. A nationwide retail 
chain reports that it is rebuilding its inventories at a modest 
pace. Sporting goods and fashion goods retailers report that 
deliveries are slow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports concerning nonretail inventories include the note that steel 
and aluminum are in abundant supply. Also, a large construction 
company reports difficulty in obtaining delivery of large dump 
trucks because manufacturers are producing the most easily made 
goods. Bottlenecks are noted in mining equipment, heavy equipment in 
general, and transformers, because of limited capacity in these 
industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       In construction a large company reports that the major sources of 
its jobs are the Alaska pipeline and projects for chemical and 
nuclear power companies. Small jobs are hard to come by. An absence 
of new speculative construction activity is noted in southeastern 
office construction and residential construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       A mixed pattern of price information includes a report by one large 
municipality that the price of buses is rising at a rate of 1 1/2 
percent per month. A large furniture company anticipates an increase 
in furniture prices of 5 to 10 percent in the near future due to 
increasing petrochemical prices. A major retailer notes that some 
price increases for apparel have occurred, but nothing dramatic. 
Coal prices are reported to have softened recently. A fertilizer 
manufacturer reports that his prices have decreased lately, 
reflecting reduced usage of fertilizer because of high prices and 
increased capacity in the industry; but supplies of fertilizer 
products which use natural gas as a feedstock are likely to be 
curtailed next spring. A construction company indicates that 
environmental protection requirements add 15 to 20 percent to the 
total cost of construction. A large paper products company reports 
cancellation of new capital spending plans because the investment 
was made uneconomical by increases in the cost of pollution control. 
A sign manufacturer complains that OASHI fines and costs of 
compliance have resulted in price increases of 7 percent and have 
also caused him to close one plant.
      </p>
      <p>
       A construction company reports that steel companies are demanding 
escalator clauses in contracts for delivery next year. Construction 
companies note an abundance of steel products and declines in 
prices. Low steel production levels and recent cutbacks in 
production are also noted. A manufacturer of cast iron confirms 
these tendencies. Orders have declined since 1973, with no sign of 
recovery. The company continues to trim its work force and feels 
inventories are still excessive. But the overcapacity problems and 
output reductions in the steel industry appear to be specific to the 
construction-related sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       A foundry which specializes in products used in mining reports a 
six-month backlog and is operating at full capacity after recent 
expansions. A casting operation reports a large increase in orders 
for products used in aircraft, automobiles, and earth-moving 
equipment. A furniture manufacturer reports an upward movement in 
its business throughout the third quarter, with strength 
concentrated in the medium- to-high end of the business. Finally, a 
producer of reading and education materials reports that sales to 
tax-supported institutions are declining as a result of cutbacks 
induced by a falloff of tax revenues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cattlemen are moving range livestock to market in record volume in 
an apparent effort to avoid expensive feeding through the upcoming 
winter months. Light calves continue to bring the lowest prices, 
typically ranging from 15 to 20 cents per pound. This is a reversal 
of the previous pattern of market prices, which declined with 
increases in the weight of animals. Crop harvests, though starting 
late, have progressed rapidly in the southeast's near-perfect 
weather during late October and early November.
