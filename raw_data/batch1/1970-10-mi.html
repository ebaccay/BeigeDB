      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The downturn in Ninth District business activity appears to have 
leveled off, but there are no indications of a significant recovery 
over the next few months. So far, the General Motors strike has had 
only a minimal impact here, but the Northwest Airlines strike is 
having a considerable influence on scattered areas of the District. 
Loan demand is still very strong according to directors and officers 
of this bank, in contrast to reports from other sections of the 
country. Agriculture income in the District is expected to fall 
below last year's level because of lower crop yields and declining 
livestock prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors and officers of this bank feel that the General Motors 
strike is having only a minimal effect on the District economy. For 
the most part, GM dealers entered the strike with heavy inventories, 
especially of the 1970 models and have actually increased their 
sales in recent weeks. According to the car dealers, people seem 
more than willing to buy 1970 models because of their lower prices 
and longer warranty periods. At the same time, auto sales of other 
makes have been brisk, and these dealers feel a part of the increase 
is due to the GM strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      An officer of the Minnesota AFL-CIO feels that the GM strike will 
continue longer than the 1967 Ford strike and could very well extend 
for at least three to four months. He based this expectation 
primarily on the fact that about 40 percent of GM's production 
workers are under 25 years old, and these workers tend to be more 
militant than the older workers. If his expectation is borne out, GM 
dealers in the District will probably run short of parts and new 
autos, as inventory shortages are already becoming apparent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Northwest Airlines strike is also having scattered effects 
throughout the District. A few firms servicing Northwest Airlines 
have furloughed employees, and a number of retail establishments 
have experienced noticeable sales reductions. In addition, Northwest 
Airlines has cut their flight schedules because of the strike, and 
as a result landing fees to a number of airports in the District 
have been drastically reduced. These landing fees are important 
contributions to airport sinking funds, and in at least one case so 
far, these reductions have become especially troublesome.
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District bankers are still experiencing strong demands for 
loanable funds, according to information gathered during 
go-around 
sessions with both directors and officers of this bank. The 
continued strong loan demand seems to be general throughout the 
District as no one cited a case where loan demand had diminished. On 
the contrary, numerous instances were cited where demand had 
actually strengthened and 
non-financial businesses had taken further 
steps to economize on the use of funds. One reason frequently cited 
for the continued strength in loan demand was that inventories 
seemed to be moving above planned or desired levels. One director 
stated that he knew that one of the top 50 firms in the nation and 
two mining companies have begun pushing off their accounts payable 
to the latest date possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      The power shortages that have plagued the East Coast have not yet 
been felt in the Ninth District, but such occurrences in the next 
few months would not be surprising. Moreover, indications are that 
over the longer horizon the problem could become critical. 
Anticipating possible shortages during the coming winter, the 
Minneapolis Gas Company, which buys gas primarily from the Northern 
Natural Gas Company, recently notified its interruptable gas 
customers to check their emergency back-up equipment because of 
potential shortages in the coming months. In addition, fuel oil 
suppliers are reluctant to make firm price bids for fuel oil to be 
delivered at a later date because of possible future shortages and 
further price increases. The price of "heavy" oil to industrial 
users in the Twin Cities has already risen to 10 cents per gallon 
from the seven cents per gallon last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm income is down from a year ago, according to the results of the 
latest agricultural credit conditions survey. The survey reflects 
conditions on October 1 according to the responses of 142 
agricultural bankers. There were two major reasons cited by 
respondents for lower income: (1) lower crop yields, which were not 
entirely offset by higher grain prices, and (2) declining livestock 
prices, especially for hogs. Lower farm receipts have caused both a 
drop in farmer and rancher spending and a slower rate of debt 
repayment. Bankers are anticipating an increase in the demand for 
farm debt refinancing as a result of the lower income. The current 
survey indicated that farm credit conditions had eased slightly in 
the last three months, but still remained tight compared with 
conditions in previous years. The rise in interest rates at 
agricultural banks appears to have slowed down and fewer bankers 
report reducing or refusing a loan due to a shortage of funds.
