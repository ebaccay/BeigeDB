      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall economic activity in the Fourth District during the past 
  month has not picked up much from last quarter. Retail sales, 
  excluding automobiles, spurted in October, and some capital goods 
  producers report further gains in orders, but recovery is not 
  broadly based. The moderated activity was partly caused by an 
  inventory correction in some key materials producing industries, 
  including steel, chemicals, and paper, as well as in consumer goods, 
  especially apparel and household goods. Consequently, operating 
  rates in these industries have eased, and expected spot shortages 
  and bottlenecks have not developed this year and are not anticipated 
  for most of next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales remain mixed, and retailers are still not certain if 
  consumer spending will strengthen without larger gains in real 
  income. A financial officer with a large discount chain noted a 
  sales spurt in the past several weeks, mainly for outerware. An 
  economist with a national retail chain in the District noted a surge 
  in sales of apparel during October, the first monthly gain since 
  early this year. He was not convinced that this pickup is a sign of 
  strengthening in consumer spending, because sales of major 
  appliances have been sagging and furniture sales have flattened 
  recently. His explanation is that slow growth in real income during 
  this expansion accounts for sluggishness in consumer spending, and 
  he expects a tax cut of about $15 billion will be needed to trigger 
  higher consumer spending in 1977. An economist with a major auto 
  producer remarked that the slippage in domestic new car sales in 
  October to an annual rate of 7.6 million units was partly due to 
  effects of the auto strike but also to some softness in the market. 
  He expects total new car sales to increase to about 10.8 million 
  units in 1977. Another auto economist was satisfied with sales of 
  1977 models of larger size cars but noted that sales of small cars 
  have not picked up as expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in capital goods continues but is not broadly based. 
  Machine tool builders in the District are increasingly optimistic 
  about 1977 prospects for shipments and profits because of the sharp 
  rebound in orders, especially from the auto industry, and the growth 
  in backlogs since late last summer. Several major producers of heavy 
  duty trucks and truck components expect recovery in output of about 
  10-15% this year from 1975, and another 20-25% gain in 1977 from 
  this year. A financial officer with a communication and information 
  handling equipment firm reports that their net orders in the last 4 
  months averaged about 30% higher than shipments, and that orders 
  have been strong for printing presses and satellite communication 
  equipment. The firm is operating at about 85-90% of capacity, 
  against a desired rate of 92-95%, and will more than double its
  capital spending for 1977 for semiconductors, offset presses and 
  other types of communication equipment. In contrast, some other 
  capital goods producers report recovery has been weak, especially 
  for certain types of construction machinery, such as excavators and 
  shovel loaders, medium-size trucks used for local delivery, and 
  industrial lift trucks. Although recovery in shipments of lift 
  trucks so far in this expansion has been negligible, one producer 
  notes an acceleration in orders last quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two economists associated with major banks in the District still 
  expect capital spending in 1977 to rise about 15% from this year. 
  One attributes the lagging recovery to low operating rates, and low 
  real rates of return on investment of about 9% compared with an 
  average of 15% during the 1950's and 1960's.
     </p>
     <p>
      A theme that surfaces in contacts with materials producers as well 
  as some consumer goods producers is that inventories were built too 
  rapidly early this year and are being adjusted downward. Inventories 
  of steel, plastics, appliances and apparel are being cut, which 
  accounts for some of the slide in output in recent months. Steel 
  operations have fallen somewhat below 75% of effective capacity in 
  recent weeks, compared with nearly 90% in May and June; and 
  economists associated with major producers in the District expect 
  production this quarter will be the lowest for any quarter this 
  year. Steel producers, who were concerned over possible shortages of 
  natural gas and coking coal this winter, if operations were 
  maintained at rates as high as late last spring, now view supplies 
  as adequate. A large plastics producer also noted a recent drop in 
  output because of inventory correction. Orders bulged earlier this 
  year in anticipation of shortages that did not surface.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some producers of consumer goods and retailers report inventories 
  were rebuilt too rapidly, partly involuntarily, which have forced 
  cutbacks in production and orders. One producer described the market 
  for all but small appliances as weakening. Output for major 
  appliances has been slashed, although this producer expects stocks 
  will be brought into balance by yearend. Two retailers noted that 
  slow sales of apparel since last spring necessitated large markdowns 
  to cut inventories, and both agreed that apparel inventories are now 
  at desired levels, although stocks of household goods are high. One 
  retailer expects excess stocks of furniture and appliances can be 
  liquidated in about one quarter.
