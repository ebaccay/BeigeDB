      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

      <strong>
       July 10, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       While business activity is on the upsurge in most parts of the 
District, inflation continues to worry most area businessmen. One 
Tennessee director described the general economic outlook as one of 
"frightened optimism." Agriculture, banking, and residential 
construction are areas most severely affected by today's inflation. 
With the continued rise in material costs, recent large wage 
settlements, and an expected drop in agricultural output next year, 
little letup in inflation is anticipated. Tourist activity continues 
to rebound in most parts of the District. Retail sales are showing 
some strength, and announcements of new industrial plants continue 
brisk.
      </p>
      <p>
       The growing concern over inflation was again evident in reports from 
businessmen and directors from all parts of the District. The farmer 
seems to be most directly affected by today's inflation. The beef 
cattle industry is reported as "sick." At the same time feed prices 
are high, cattle prices have dropped substantially. One large 
Tennessee farmer reports a year and one-half supply of feeder calves 
currently on pasture, which may have to be marketed if pastures dry 
up. Alabama's and Georgia's poultry industries are also facing 
price-costs squeezes. Some 30,000 baby turkeys were reportedly 
slaughtered in Georgia because the cost of raising them is much 
higher than current selling prices. The net impact of this cost-price squeeze will most likely be less meat output and higher prices 
in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       District banks are feeling the impact of tight money, skyrocketing 
interest rates, and inflation. Though deposit growth is lagging, 
loan demand continues strong. A Tennessee director reports that 
consumer and commercial loans are still on the increase. Tennessee 
municipalities are now turning to commercial banks and adding to 
loan demand because they cannot market municipal bonds at statutory 
interest rates. Mobile home loans are beginning to pick up. 
Tennessee's 10 percent interest rate ceiling on bank loans is also 
adding to strength in loans from other borrowers. One Alabama bank 
representative thought that the Federal Reserve Board should force 
banks to screen credits and curtail lending. Businessmen are 
apparently becoming apprehensive over the rumors that banks are 
heavily loaned with little or no liquidity. An Alabama director 
notes that the president of a large corporation became so concerned 
that he had their funds scattered among various banks. Another 
businessman asked this director to recommend banks in which not to 
carry funds. Reports from Alabama and Tennessee indicate that 
delinquency rates on business loans are high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction remains sluggish in all parts of the 
District. Savings and loans in Georgia have experienced a sharp 
decline in inflows of both savings and mortgage loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales seem to be improving and are now giving some strength 
to the District's economy. Reports from Jacksonville and Palm Beach, 
Florida, as well as from areas of Tennessee, indicate strong sales, 
particularly in appliances. A Tennessee director notes that credit 
cards are being used to their fullest. He believes that the 
inflation psychology of buying today to beat tomorrow's price 
increases has really caught hold. Recreation vehicles sales are 
reportedly improving in Florida and Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourist activity, as reported earlier, is on the upswing. South 
Florida's tourist trade is up, with hotel and motel occupancy rates 
climbing. In Miami Beach, the occupancy rate in April was 71 
percent. Tourism is doing well in New Orleans; most guests appear to 
be arriving by air. There has been a sharp upturn in tourist 
business in all areas of Tennessee. Smoky Mountain National Park has 
begun to attract an increasing number of visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor markets remain generally strong, despite some rise in 
unemployment related to energy problems. Although the worst of these 
problems seems to be over, a large textile manufacturer is closing 
two plants-one in Alabama and one in Tennessee. Approximately 1,300 
workers will lose their jobs from these closings. An increase in 
strike activity is also temporarily idling workers. Several strikes 
in the construction trades, particularly in Florida and Louisiana, 
are now in progress. Workers in Atlanta area auto-assembly plants 
have been idled by strikes in parts plants outside the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       Representatives of a large Alabama materials company indicate that 
their plant and equipment investment is running 15 to 20 percent 
behind schedule this year, largely because of delivery problems with 
capital goods. They are having particular problems with rail car 
deliveries. The high level of interest rates is not influencing 
their capital spending or inventory plans. But compensating balance 
requirements on unused commitments have forced them to hold their 
bank lines to a minimum. The availability of petroleum feedstocks 
continues to be a source of concern for this company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending plans for new or expanded plants were again heavy. 
The most significant announcement was a $2.7 billion uranium 
enrichment plant to be built on the Chattahoochee River near Dothan, 
Alabama. It is the largest single industrial development ever 
planned for Alabama. Seven thousand people will be employed in its 
construction, and when completed in 1983 one thousand four hundred 
people are expected to be employed. A Japanese spinning company will 
open in October in Columbus, Georgia; the $2.5 million plant will 
employ about 90 persons. Industrial expansion and new plants are 
doing well in Tennessee. Twelve new plants were built in the first 
quarter of this year and 19 expansions occurred. A number of new 
plants have been announced in Louisiana along the Mississippi and 
Red Rivers.
