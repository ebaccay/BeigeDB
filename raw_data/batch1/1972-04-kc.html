      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 12, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Construction is still an important source of economic strength in 
the Tenth District. Housing starts, which have been considerably 
greater than last year, are expected to continue strong through the 
year, and nonresidential construction activity also is expected to 
improve. District savings and loan associations report continuing 
large inflows of savings and substantially increasing mortgage 
commitments. Real estate lending by banks remains strong, and banks' 
construction loans are on the rise throughout the District. Other 
business lending is growing, though less universally than 
construction loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the last Red Book, it was reported that retail meat prices had 
risen sharply and that further increases would likely occur. The 
most recent consumer price index confirms the reports made a month 
ago, as meat prices accounted for 70 per cent of the sharp advance 
in retail food prices posted in February. With all the national 
attention on food prices, spot checks were made with a few retail 
food chains to determine what changes, if any, have occurred in meat 
prices in recent weeks. Modest increases have occurred in some cases 
but the general tone reflected greater stability than was 
anticipated a month ago. Very recently, meat prices have weakened, 
with the respondents reporting that the prospects for further 
declines are good in the near term. Nevertheless, it is unlikely 
that any downward adjustment in wholesale prices will be passed on 
fully to the consumer; thus, retail meat prices, after a brief 
period of uncertainty, may show less downward movement than 
currently reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction activity continues to be a source of strength for Tenth 
District economic activity. Commercial and industrial construction 
in the District are expected to be better this year than last year, 
with the last half of 1972 expected to be better than the first. 
Road and heavy construction activity are expected to improve in 
Kansas and Missouri due to actual and anticipated increases in 
funding of new state highway building programs. The housing market 
is good, and housing starts continue well above the same period last 
year. Several large housing contractors interviewed believe that 
1972 as a whole will continue to surpass 1971 in housing starts, 
although one respondent feels that the national housing boom may be 
peaking out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homebuilders interviewed have varying feelings about the possible 
effects of changing finance costs. One company doesn't anticipate 
much effect on housing starts this year from any firming of mortgage 
rates, while another expects a quick change in the rate of housing 
starts if mortgage rates go up later this year. A third respondent 
thinks that loan rates could rise one-fourth of 1 per cent with no 
slowdown in construction, but that a larger rise would lead to a 
tapering off in housing starts after a three or four month lag.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviews with a number of large savings and loan associations in 
the District suggest that home mortgage interest rates are expected 
to remain the same or rise slightly in the near future, following a 
general decline in the last three months. Most associations reported 
no change in nonrate terms. Savings inflows continued to be strong 
through March at nearly all institutions interviewed, in some cases, 
especially so.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were two exceptions noted to this pattern: one firm reported 
March inflows not so good but noted that its competitors were doing 
better because the respondent firm is refusing "big ticket 
depositors who are too unpredictable;" a second respondent 
attributed a March slowdown in inflows to its dropping of 6 per cent 
savings certificates. Mortgage commitments were uniformly reported 
as very strong and increasing substantially. Of those firms making 
loans on both single-family and multi-family units, most report a 
greater emphasis on single-family dwellings.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upturn in business loan demand at commercial banks, seen as only 
quite tentative by Tenth District bankers at the time of the last 
Red Book, has gained in scope and size over the last several weeks. 
Nearly all of the gains are emanating from local borrowersâ€”no 
upsurge was reported among national accounts. This imbalance, which 
may be due to many Tenth District banks not following the prime rate 
when it went below 5 per cent earlier this year, is expected to 
diminish with the rise of the national prime rate back to District 
levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The upturn is least evident in Kansas City, where business lending 
seems fairly flat, while the most vigorous growth was reported in 
Tulsa. Construction loans were on the rise everywhere. The advance 
in loans to other types of businesses is broadly based, with many 
industries borrowing for a variety of purposes. Moderate gains in 
business loans are expected during the second quarter. In other loan 
categories, real estate lending remains quite strong, and consumer 
installment loans continued to rise in March, at what some bankers 
feel is a faster pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand deposits were steady or declining in March at District banks, 
while time deposits continued to climb. The 
several-months-old 
pattern of decreases in large CD's and increases in consumer savings 
and time deposits continued to hold, although rising marketable CD 
rates are expected to moderate these trends.
