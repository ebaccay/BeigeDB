      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 13, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       According to our directors, business conditions vary widely from 
continuing strength to considerable weakness. Materials shortages 
are widespread and are creating production bottlenecks. Concern that 
materials will be unavailable when needed has led to inventory 
accumulation, according to bank directors.
      </p>
      <p>
       New orders are reported as very strong in machinery and equipment 
manufacturing, especially items dealing with oil exploration. Ship-building orders are also heavy because of the need to build new 
types of tankers to transport liquefied natural gas. One director 
commented that "business is better than the headlines."
      </p>
      <p>
       Material shortages were mentioned by all the directors. One director 
commented that "anything you want takes extra time and effort to 
get". This director reports that purchasing agents have to look all 
over the world for even minor items in order to keep production 
going. Steel products—tubular pipes for oil drilling and sheet 
plates for ships—were among the many items cited as in short 
supply. Aluminum, metals, castings, plastics and semi-manufactured 
parts were also reported as being part of the "amazing 
conglomeration of shortages." As a result of the shortages, several 
directors reported that firms are building larger than needed 
inventories to keep a hedge on needed materials. Hoarding of raw 
materials is especially evident in imported goods,
      </p>
      <p>
       One director noted that when price controls are lifted, the 
shortages disappear. He cited that resins had been unavailable from 
domestic sources at the controlled price (and were being bought 
previously in Mexico with their Ohio labeling still on them), but in 
the one week since resins have been decontrolled, they have become 
readily available—at twice their previous price. Other directors 
also expressed the belief that materials shortages have been created 
by producers who are either shipping goods abroad in order to import 
them at decontrolled prices or are diverting supplies to get them 
into the most expensive channels. The oil industry was mentioned as 
an example of the latter machinations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Small business firms were particularly singled out as being hurt by 
these shortages. One director expects unemployment rates to rise to 
well over 10 percent in those areas of Connecticut where small 
manufacturing firms predominate. Gasoline shortages, he noted, will 
make labor mobility more difficult from the high unemployment areas. 
Unemployment rates rose in December in all the New England states, 
climbing to 7.3 percent (seasonally adjusted) in Massachusetts. A 
director from a Connecticut telephone company mentioned that due to 
the low level of residential and commercial construction in 
Connecticut, the company is considering going on a shorter workweek 
at the end of March, for the first time since the 1930s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another area of weakness is the recreational area. Ski areas have 
been hurt by lack of snow and the scare over gasoline shortages, 
although gasoline is reported as available in ski country. 
Manufacturers of recreational vehicles have also been hurt. Camper 
business is reported as "limping" by one director and the motor boat 
business is also slow, although sailboat sales are reported as 
"fantastic." General aviation aircraft backlogs were being reduced, 
one director noted.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a sharp split in the policy advice of the academic 
correspondents this month. To Dr. Shapiro, the main danger is that 
the Fed be "drawn off course [of 5 to 6 percent growth in money 
narrowly defined or 8 to 9 percent growth in money broadly defined] 
by political forces." He cited with approval the Chairman's 
statement that an oil shortage cannot be overcome by an excess of 
liquidity. He likened the present situation to the 1940 and 1945 
experiences when supply constraints were binding in face of large 
increases in demand. To Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, and Tobin, 
the primary danger lies in an insufficiently expansionary policy. 
Eckstein was optimistic about a recovery by the fourth quarter but 
based his optimism on a 7 percent rate of monetary growth this year. 
A 5 percent growth rate would produce a substantial rise in interest 
rates in the second half of the year which the projected "tender" 
recovery could not survive.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Pointing to the weakness of 
nonagricultural final sales last quarter, Samuelson expected 
negative growth in both the first and second quarters. He has become 
less confident about the end of the oil boycott and feels the damage 
to auto sales will be irreversible. Restating his view that the Fed 
should not seek to roll back energy-related inflation, he advocated 
between now and April or May, an 8 percent rate of growth of money 
narrowly defined and a 10 percent rate for the broad definition. The 
risk of error, he argued, lies on the downside, Neither Samuelson 
nor Tobin found the decline in short rates too rapid. Tobin felt the 
Fed should not be afraid to accommodate the increase in liquidity 
demand which has occurred and should lower the Federal funds rate to 
the 7 1/2 to 8 percent range in the next policy period.
