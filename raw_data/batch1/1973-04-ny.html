      Beige Book Report: New York

       April 11, 1973
      </strong>

       The Second district directors that were recently contacted continued 
to point to a strong business outlook. Consumer spending and 
business plant and equipment outlays were said to have remained at a 
high level, and the devaluation of the dollar in general was 
expected to lead to an improved international trade balance. 
However, there were continued reports of further tightening in labor 
markets, of growing shortages of fuel and raw materials, and of 
imbalances between the demand and supply of food which current 
consumer resistance to high food prices would do little to correct. 
As a result, concern over mounting inflationary pressures, and 
skepticism over the capability of Phase 3 to cope with such 
pressures, continued to be expressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales were reported as generally strong, and it was noted 
that the income tax refunds now being paid would provide added 
stimulus in the months ahead. One director felt that the currently 
high level of auto sales—which he characterized as of boom 
proportions—in part reflected some "buying ahead" in anticipation 
of higher prices resulting from the additional antipollution and 
safety equipment scheduled for the 1974 and 1975 models. As in 
previous months, a number of directors reported that retail sales 
were stronger in the suburban shopping areas than in inner-city 
outlets. One director noted the recent softening of consumer 
confidence, probably reflecting concern over inflation, indicated in 
some recent surveys; however, this director felt that consumer 
spending would nonetheless be strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trend of business plant and equipment spending was also 
characterized as strong by a number of directors. A similar 
assessment was implicit in reports of the Buffalo branch directors, 
who observed that while there seemed to be a pervasive gloominess 
among businessmen in their area, these same businessmen were 
forecasting continued strength in their own companies' performances. 
The chairman of the board of a large oil company noted the adverse 
effect of environmental controls on capital outlays in the petroleum 
industry, which were severely hampering the construction of deep 
ports to accommodate super tankers, new drilling operations, and the 
construction of the Alaska pipe line.
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of directors reported that employment has continued at a 
high level in their area, with the availability of certain types of 
workers falling short of demand. A senior official of a large 
upstate manufacturer felt that the job market in general was 
gradually tightening, with skilled workers in short supply. Two 
upstate bankers characterized employment as at a very high level, 
with continued tight market conditions expected for the balance of 
the year. Another respondent noted that unemployment in the Buffalo 
area still remained relatively high, but looked for this situation 
to improve as steel and auto plants increased hiring. However, most 
directors commenting on the employment outlook for students this 
summer took a gloomy view of prospects in that area, partly because 
of cutbacks in federally funded student summer employment programs. 
Some of the directors observed that substantial youth unemployment 
over the summer was one of the most serious problems facing cities 
in their areas. The senior official of the large upstate 
manufacturing firm, however, felt that the outlook for student 
employment this summer was probably the best since 1969.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were also further reports of growing raw material shortages, 
including petroleum products, wood products, and nonferrous metals. 
In the latter context, the president of a multinational nonferrous 
metals producing corporation reported there were indications that 
"hot money" had moved into the future markets for such metals. The 
same director also stated that widespread raw material shortages—rather than plant capacity—seemed likely to lead to production 
bottlenecks over the coming months, and that the energy crisis was 
the single most important problem on the economic horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the impact of the recent dollar devaluation, a New York 
City banker reported that this move would tend to produce a "one 
shot" increase in his institution's earnings by virtue of its effect 
on income from its overseas investments. He expressed concern, 
however, over the extent to which this development might give rise 
over the long run to more widespread use of controls on the 
international flow of funds. The official of the oil company 
reported that the recent international monetary steps should 
eventually help improve the country's trade balance, although he 
felt labor costs and productivity remained the crucial factors in 
any lasting improvement. According to this director, one immediate 
effect of the devaluation has been to exert significant upward 
pressures on oil import prices. Similarly, the president of a 
multinational nonferrous metal producing firm stated the devaluation 
had heightened the pressure on raw material prices, particularly 
those of nonferrous metals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Against this background, concern over the prospects of mounting 
inflationary pressures in general continued unabated. The New York 
banker felt that Phase 3 appears to have triggered a new wave of 
inflationary expectations, and stated that inflation was currently 
the major economic and financial problem facing the Nation. Another 
director felt that the elimination under Phase 3 of the day-to-day 
administrative delays in granting price increases was contributing 
to the rapid rise in prices (and would also contribute to a sharp 
increase in profits). According to most of the Buffalo branch 
directors, growing consumer resistance to high food prices by itself 
would not have a lasting effect. However, the directors felt that 
recent moves by the Administration to increase the supply of feed 
grains and imported beef should tend to bring about a leveling of 
prices by the last quarter of the year.
