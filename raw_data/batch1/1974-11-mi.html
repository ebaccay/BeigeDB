       Even though some softening in farm income is anticipated, no 
immediate letup in consumer spending or increase in unemployment 
were foreseen, in general, by District bank directors. District 
gross farm income in 1974 is expected to approximately equal last 
year's level, and net farm income is anticipated to be down from a 
year earlier. In addition, credit conditions are tight at District 
rural banks. Although slowing was cited in several retail spending 
categories, especially automobiles, the consensus was that despite 
the softening in farm income, spending in rural areas has not yet 
been significantly affected and District retailers are hopeful for a 
good Christmas season. In contrast to the prospects of sharply 
rising unemployment in the national economy, several directors 
foresaw no immediate increase in their areas joblessness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the consensus among directors was that the District's gross 
farm income in 1974 will approximately match last year's level, the 
situation is expected to vary within the District. Given that 
livestock prices are down 60 to 70 percent from a year ago, a 
Montana director indicated that the outlook is rather bleak for the 
District's livestock industry; this view was also voiced by a 
western South Dakota director. Grain producers in Montana are 
benefiting from record high prices and relatively good crops this 
year, but farm receipts are expected to be off this year in North 
Dakota, where dry weather restricted crop yields. Directors from 
Minnesota and western Wisconsin state that they expected their 
areas' farmers to do quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the above opinions about gross farm receipts, directors looked 
for District net farm income to be down in 1974 from a year ago; 
however, one view was that 1974's District farm income would be high 
by historical standards. Another opinion was that District farmers 
have considerable savings and that crop incomes were carried over 
from 1973, which would help support their income this year. One more 
view was that the general softening in the economy would put 
downward pressure on farm input prices, which would also help the 
net farm income situation in 1975.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our latest agricultural credit conditions survey, this 
year's District farm income developments have slowed deposit growth 
at rural banks and increased loan demand. The slow deposit growth is 
a result of several factors: 1. Drought and frost have reduced crop 
yields in many areas. 2. In areas where crops are good, farmers are 
holding their crops in hope of benefiting from further price 
increases. 3. Cattle prices are lower than last year. 4. The 
movement of feeder cattle from western ranges to Midwestern feedlots 
has been much slower than usual. Further, the contract market for 
feeder cattle virtually disappeared this past summer. At the same 
time that deposit growth has slowed, loan demand has remained high. 
Bankers indicated that an important reason for this has been the 
need to finance cow-calf operations through the winter months, since 
many ranchers will be holding their calves and yearlings and 
gambling on a turnaround in the livestock industry next spring. 
Consequently, credit conditions are tight at District rural banks. 
Thirty percent of our survey's respondents expect problems in 
meeting their fourth quarter loan demand, and only 27 percent are 
actively seeking new loan accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even though concern was expressed about sales prospects and some 
softening was reported, directors generally expected District retail 
spending to hold up quite well until the end of the year. Directors 
from rural areas indicated that the softening in farm income either 
had not yet begun or else was just beginning to affect spending in 
their areas. This view was also expressed by District bankers 
responding to our latest agricultural credit conditions survey. 
Several directors stated that their areas' retailers were looking 
for a good Christmas season. Still another view was that Christmas 
spending would be stronger in the District than in the nation. One 
director stated that retail sales have been spotty in his area, and 
another expected consumer nondurable sales to hold up quite well but 
higher-priced durable sales to be off. Higher-priced and fashion 
merchandise was selling quite well in another directors s area, but 
lower-priced merchandise was becoming somewhat difficult to move. 
Most directors stated that auto and truck sales were off in their 
areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast to the increasingly bleak prospects for employment 
nationally, several directors were rather optimistic about their 
areas' prospects. In North Dakota, labor market conditions were 
termed normal and a skilled labor shortage was cited. In Montana, 
expansion in the coal industry is absorbing workers; however, the 
underground copper mines there were recently closed, affecting 700 
workers. The unemployment rate is currently at its lowest level in a 
number of years in the upper peninsula of Michigan, as that area has 
benefited from the increased demand for iron ore. Within the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, however, some layoffs have 
been reported. Recently, a large window manufacturer layed off 680 
people—approximately a third of its work force—in response to the 
slump in the housing industry. Also, concern was expressed that a 
prolonged period of severely cold weather this winter could disrupt 
natural gas supplies to industrial employers in the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul area, resulting in additional layoffs this winter.
