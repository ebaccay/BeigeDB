     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Several Ninth District economic indicators weakened in the second 
  quarter. Growth rates for retail sales were down considerably from 
  the first quarter. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the 
  District rose slightly in May to 6.0 percent. Housing permits fell 
  from the first quarter rate. Manufacturers responding to the bank's 
  latest quarterly Industrial Expectations Survey revised their sales 
  expectations downward from the previous Survey. Business investment 
  still had not picked up by early July, and as was true in June, 
  capacity constraints still were not a problem in this District. 
  Finally, the District's agricultural situation improved from the 
  previous month.
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth rate for retail sales in May-June was down substantially 
  from the early months of 1976. The year-over growth rate through 
  April had been about 25 percent. But nearly all firms reported 
  smaller gains in May and June, and some firms said that sales were 
  slightly less than in 1975 (May and June retail sales in 1975 were 
  robust in this District). Some retailers even felt that stocks had 
  become larger than desirable, in light of the recent dip in consumer 
  spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales appeared weakest in the District's rural areas—perhaps due 
  to widespread drought conditions. Sales in the Twin Cities have been 
  stronger, with some stores still experiencing increases over last 
  June of nearly 20 percent. Nonetheless, most increases were smaller. 
  A firm which operates stores nationwide said, for instance, that its 
  June sales in Minnesota were about 10 percent above last year 
  compared with its national sales gain of 6 to 8 percent. A 
  representative of the firm said that the 10 percent gain was better 
  than had been anticipated overall. Retailers—even those with lower 
  June sales than in 1975—continue to be optimistic about the second 
  half.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among individual products, autos continued to move well. 
  Intermediate and full-sized models were selling best. Short stocks 
  of intermediates and specialty models were common. Tourism was doing 
  well in the District and resort owners expected sellouts in July and 
  August. The drought caused sales of some items—such as lawnmowers—to fall, but caused sales of irrigation equipment to rise.
     </p>
     <p>
      District labor markets weakened in the second quarter, according to 
  several seasonally adjusted indicators, although quarter-to-quarter 
  comparisons of seasonally adjusted data are perhaps misleading due 
  to the unusually mild first quarter in the District. The 
  unemployment rate edged upward to 6.0 percent of the labor force, 
  from 5.7 percent in March. Employment, seasonally adjusted, leveled 
  off after several months of increase; actual employment growth was 
  substantial and total employment was up about 3 percent from 1975. 
  The volume of help-wanted advertising indicated a continuing strong 
  demand for labor. Manufacturing employment turned up in May and was 
  about 2 percent above the trough of last winter.
     </p>
     <p>
      April data on housing permits indicated that sector also tapered off 
  from first quarter performance, though the unseasonably warm winter 
  again makes interpretation of data difficult. The slowdown was not 
  merely statistical, however, and builders have expressed 
  disappointment at the rate of new home sales in recent weeks. They 
  attribute the slowdown to buyer resistance to new homes' prices and 
  to the recent upturn in interest rates. S&amp;Ls are liquid, so that 
  there is no evidence of a scarcity of mortgage money in the 
  District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing sales gains in the second and third quarters may be 
  lower than expected and lower than first quarter advances. 
  Manufacturers said that first quarter sales were 15 percent above 
  last year, and they projected second quarter sales at 13 percent 
  above 1975, down from an earlier projection of 16 percent. 
  Manufacturers said that current inventories are at adequate levels 
  in light of future sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business investment spending remained soft in the District; the 
  current dollar value of nonresidential construction awards was only 
  slightly above 1975. Excess capacity still exists in most sectors, 
  so that there is little incentive to make capital outlays at this 
  time. In addition, manufacturers still have some doubts about the 
  staying power of the recovery: for example, one manufacturer in the 
  District says that his firm has been postponing spending proposals 
  for several months due to an uncertain outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the District's farm sector, crop conditions improved from a month 
  ago. Rains boosted prospects in areas afflicted by the spring 
  drought. On balance, yields in the District will likely be lower 
  than trend, but crop conditions varied widely in the District. 
  Moisture supplies were still extremely short across western 
  Minnesota and eastern South Dakota. But the remainder of Minnesota's 
  corn and soybean crops were in fair to good condition as of late 
  June, with some areas even reporting excellent conditions. Row crop 
  growth in Minnesota was greater than normal; however, frequent rain 
  will still be needed to carry crops through to maturity. Small grain 
  yields in Minnesota were harder hit by drought than corn or beans. 
  Crop conditions were mixed across North Dakota, the major producer 
  of spring wheat. The Montana winter wheat crop, on the other hand, 
  is in generally good condition, though yields will be down slightly 
  from last year.
