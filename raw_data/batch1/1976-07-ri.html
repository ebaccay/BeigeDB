      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Responses to our latest survey of Fifth District business conditions 
  suggest a decided pause in the current expansion. Manufacturers 
  reports suggest a decline in new orders in June, with shipments 
  apparently showing no change and backlogs of orders falling off. 
  Inventories of finished goods were reported to be larger than a 
  month earlier and current levels are considered excessive by nearly 
  one-third of our respondents. Despite this apparent slackening in 
  the rate of advance, District manufacturers remain optimistic. 
  Expectations of continued gains in the level of business activity 
  are not quite as widespread as in some recent months, but over one-half of our manufacturing respondents expect further improvement 
  over the next six months. Beyond some normal lengthening of lead 
  times, there are no signs of any difficulties arising with respect 
  to the availability of materials and supplies. Reports from 
  retailers indicate a similar pattern of activity: sluggish sales, a 
  relative decline in sales of big ticket items, and further expansion 
  of inventories. Large District banks report only nominal growth of 
  commercial and industrial loan volume in recent weeks. In the 
  agricultural sector, the general condition of most major field crops 
  in the District has improved in recent weeks in response to much-needed rain and warmer weather.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of manufacturers responding to our survey, one-half report no change 
  in shipments over the past month. The remaining one-half are evenly 
  divided between reporting increases and decreases. Meanwhile, over 
  40 percent indicate reduced volume of new orders and over one-third 
  report declines in backlogs of orders. More than one-third also 
  reported increased inventories of finished goods, while stocks of 
  materials were apparently unchanged. Inventory levels are now 
  considered excessive by nearly one-third of our manufacturing 
  respondents, while nearly as many view current plant and equipment 
  capacity in excess. Nonetheless, employment continues to rise in 
  most sectors of the District economy, and reports of higher prices 
  are widespread.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among individual industries textile, apparel, chemical, and 
  furniture manufacturers seem to have been typical, experiencing some 
  weakness in the volume of new orders. Respondents from the primary 
  metals industry report little change from a month ago, while 
  producers of machinery and equipment showed some gains in this area. 
  Inventories are considered excessive in furniture and fixtures, 
  while in most other industries a majority of respondents consider 
  current levels about right. There are individual respondents in 
  virtually every industry surveyed, however, who feel current stocks 
  are excessive.
     </p>
     <p>
      Citing cooler than usual weather and a general lack of consumer 
  confidence, retailers responding to our survey report marginally 
  weaker sales in June and the first relative decline in sales of big 
  ticket items since December. Reports suggest a continuing spate of 
  bargain hunting, but with consumers retaining an eye for quality. 
  Rather widespread inventory accumulation and the recent sluggish 
  sales pace have left over 70 percent of our retail respondents with 
  what they feel are excessive inventories. Price increases at the 
  retail level are reported with greater frequency than in recent 
  months, although most respondents report no change in prices, 
  received or paid, since May. Retailers remain optimistic about the 
  level of business activity, particularly with respect to sales in 
  their own firms. Nearly 60 percent expect further improvement in the 
  level of activity nationally and in their individual market areas 
  over the next six months, but over 80 percent expect sales in their 
  own firms to improve over that time period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The availability of supplies and materials does not appear to be 
  presenting any serious problems in the Fifth District. Most of our 
  contacts in industry report at worst some lengthening of lead time, 
  but even that is considered normal. Most firms continue to report 
  that their orders are being met promptly and that they anticipate no 
  difficulties in meeting orders for their own products. Only one 
  respondent, an apparel manufacturer, reported operations being 
  hampered by the performance of his key suppliers. One manufacturer 
  mentioned the rubber strike, which he feels would adversely affect 
  operations by the end of July.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite seasonal strength in business credit demand from 
  agriculture-related industry, total C&amp;I loan volume at large 
  District banks has shown only nominal growth in recent weeks. 
  According to area bankers, continued cyclical weakness in business 
  loans is due to two basic factors. First, local industry reaction to 
  the recent slowing in nondurable sales has been swift and 
  conservative. In North Carolina, for example, the textile industry 
  is said to have quickly tightened production to forestall unwanted 
  inventory accumulation. Second, there is almost complete lack of 
  term loan requests for purposes of business fixed investment. 
  Consequently, loan volume is still below desired levels. Consumer 
  lending is still advancing, but not as rapidly as in recent months. 
  This seems to hold for both revolving credits and direct installment 
  loans. Large District S&amp;Ls generally report that the demand for 
  mortgage funds remains very strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the agricultural sector, earnings from farm marketings continue 
  to run above a year ago. But the 2 percent gain in the District 
  during January-April was much smaller than the 10 percent increase 
  recorded nationally. The corn outlook is especially promising, with 
  prospects for a record harvest in North Carolina. However, excessive 
  soil moisture is causing problems for crop farmers in many areas of 
  South Carolina.
