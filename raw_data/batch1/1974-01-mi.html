       The energy crisis has not yet forced substantial cutbacks in 
District economic activity, but businessmen are concerned about the 
future. In addition, other materials besides fuel are in short 
supply and delivery times are being stretched out. District 
retailers enjoyed a good Christmas season, with sales generally up 
to expectations. Several bank directors expect a decline in home 
building in their areas in 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a number of District layoffs have been attributed to the 
energy crisis, fuel shortages have not yet seriously disrupted 
District economic activity, and mild fourth-quarter weather has 
lessened the threat of heating-fuel shortages. District businessmen, 
however, remain concerned about how the energy crisis will affect 
their operations. A director associated with retail trade said that 
his firm has had enough fuel for its regular operations, but he felt 
it was too early to assess the impact of gasoline shortages on 
consumer shopping habits. Another director reported some concern in 
his community about employees having adequate gasoline to commute to 
work. Also, in his community a firm producing plastic parts for cars 
was concerned about automobile sales declining in 1974. According to 
another director, the fuel crisis has not yet directly affected 
sewer and highway building, but uncertainty over prices is making 
contractors hesitant to bid on projects. A Montana director 
indicated that there was no lack of gasoline in his area; he 
believed that a considerable amount of gasoline is being stored by 
consumers and businessmen.
      </p>
      <p>
       A survey of nine ski resorts located away from the District's major 
population centers indicated that the energy crisis did not hurt 
their holiday business. Only one ski area reported poor business 
during the Christmas-New Year period and, in general, ski-area 
operators look for business to remain good for the remainder of the 
season. No shortage of gasoline existed in any of the areas 
surveyed. Several operators indicated, however, that business from 
local customers was up, while customers who had to travel any 
distance were staying away. The concern in the resort and travel 
industry appears to be shifting from the fuel shortage's impact on 
winter recreational activities to the summer tourist business. A 
lack of gasoline this summer as well as the possibility of rationing 
could seriously hamper the District's tourist industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors indicated that other materials besides fuel are becoming 
difficult to obtain. A plastic resins shortage has forced one 
director's firm to curb some operations. Other directors reported no 
shortages in their areas but stated that delivery times are being 
stretched out. A Montana director has had to wait over a year to 
obtain farm machinery and remains uncertain as to when this 
machinery will be shipped.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many District retailers enjoyed a good Christmas season, as sales 
exceeded earlier expectations. Major Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers 
responding to a newspaper survey indicated that December sales were 
up from a year ago, and most stores equaled or surpassed their sales 
expectations. Furthermore, a director who heads a major retailing 
organization reported that, after some softening in sales growth 
last fall, his firm's relative year-to-year sales gain in December 
came close to matching the larger increases achieved earlier in the 
year. A North Dakota director termed his area's Christmas spending 
"great" due to high farm incomes. A Wisconsin director reported 
"excellent" Christmas business in his community, and a Montana 
director termed Christmas spending "good" in his area. On the other 
hand, an Upper Peninsula director said Christmas sales in his area 
only equaled year-earlier levels, while a Minnesota director from 
outside the Twin Cities indicated his area's Christmas sales were 
not up to expectations. Major Minneapolis-St. Paul retailers are 
uncertain about the future, and most look for modest sales gains in 
1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       The number of new District housing units authorized during the first 
eleven months of 1973 was down 22 percent from a year earlier, and 
several directors look for declines in their areas residential 
building in 1974. A director from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan 
indicated that a scarcity of fuel for heating homes was expected to 
curb his area's residential construction, while two other directors 
indicated the availability and cost of mortgage money would hurt 
their areas' home building. A North Dakota director, on the other 
hand, stated that the outlook for home building in his area was 
good. In addition, the apartment vacancy rate in the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul area in November was 5.6 percent, compared with 8.9 percent 
last February, which indicates District apartment construction may 
improve later this year.
