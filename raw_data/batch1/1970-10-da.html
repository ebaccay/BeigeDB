      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      For this report, thirty-one city and county finance officers in the 
Eleventh District were surveyed concerning current and anticipated 
levels of government expenditures and the means of financing these 
expenditures. The officers surveyed reported: (1) Most governmental 
units had a substantial increase in 1970 expenditures over those in 
1969, and anticipated additional increases in 1971; (2) Nearly 

  three-fourths of the units had awarded a wage increase to their 
employees in 1970; (3) Only a few units had postponed capital issues 
in 1970—due to either legal interest rate ceilings or other reasons; 
(4) About half of the governmental units planned new capital issues 
to be sold within the next nine months; and (5) Over 70 percent of 
the units had participated in some type of federally funded project 
requiring matching or local funding responsibility in 1970.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to 1970 expenditure levels (including both current and 
capital spending), the majority of officers reported a substantial 
increase (9 to 12 percent) in spending over the 1969 level, with 
about one-fifth reporting a spending increase in the neighborhood of 
20 percent. A few of the smaller units reported no change with one 
city showing a substantial decline in expenditures due to the 
completion of a major capital spending program during 1969. Although 
many officers did not yet have preliminary expenditure estimates 
available for 1971, of those who did, the majority again foresaw an 
increase in spending of from 9 to 12 percent. Moreover, about one-fifth of those surveyed anticipated expenditures in 1971 to exceed 
1970 levels by 20 percent or more. Two of the city officers noted 
that they expected over a 50-percent increase in expenditures in 
1971 due to large capital spending programs planned for next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly three-fourths of the officers surveyed reported that their 
units had awarded a wage increase sometime during 1970. Increases 
made ranged from 3 to 15 percent, most being about 5 percent. 
Several of the city officers mentioned that fire and police 
personnel were awarded wage increases from 2 to 4 percent higher 
than those for other employees. Some units had made across-the-board 
wage increases from $25 to $43 a month which resulted in a 5 percent 
or more increase—depending on individual pay levels. In addition, 
many officers reported that their units had improved fringe benefits 
substantially during the year. A few officers noted that their wage 
increase was not considered a "cost-of-living" increase, but was 
extended in order to remain competitive with other employers in 
their area. Finally, a number of the officers mentioned that they 
expected additional wage increases early next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only five of the thirty-one officers reported having postponed any 
new capital issues during 1970. Of these five, two had postponed 
bond issues because voters had approved the issues with interest 
rate ceilings (4.5-5 percent) that were not competitive in 1970 
markets. The other three officers mentioned that they had no legal 
rate ceilings, but had postponed the issues until a later date 
because of what they considered to be excessive interest rates 
prevailing in capital markets during the past year.
     </p>
     <p>
      About half of the officers surveyed indicated that their 
governmental unit planned to sell new capital issues sometime in the 
coming nine months—many before the end of the year. A number of the 
other officers noted that some proposed bond issues had not yet been 
approved by the voters, but could possibly receive the necessary 
approval and be issued sometime before mid-1971.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over 70 percent of the governmental units had participated in at 
least one federally funded project requiring some local funding 
responsibility during 1970. There was some difficulty in estimating 
funds expended on annual basis since there is some overlapping of 
fiscal and calendar years, and many of the projects are ongoing, 
requiring a number of years for completion. The majority of the 
projects involved matching funds (50-50) between federal and local 
governments; however, there were several projects that involved 60 
to 70 percent federal money. A few of the officers surveyed 
mentioned that their units had made proposals for projects involving 
federal funds—with approval anticipated in the near future.
