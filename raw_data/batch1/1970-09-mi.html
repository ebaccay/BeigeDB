     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 9, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Ninth Federal Reserve District continued 
weak through July and August. Primarily as a result of increasing 
unemployment nationwide, there appears to have been some back-migration to the rural areas and smaller towns of the District. 
Retailers in the District have become more optimistic in their six-month sales forecasts, but District manufacturers have revised their 
anticipations downward. Retail. price increases are becoming less 
prevalent than they were earlier this year, but industrial price 
increases show no signs of abating.
     </p>
     <p>
      Increasing rates of unemployment in urban centers nationwide are 
resulting in some movement back to rural areas and small towns in 
the District. Bank directors felt that more people would be coming 
back if there were suitable job opportunities not necessarily at the 
same skill or pay levels. It is interesting to note, however, that 
some of the directors felt that this reverse migration, although 
largely caused by lack of urban job opportunities is also the result 
of a growing disenchantment with urban conditions. For example, one 
director cited the case of Billings, Montana, school system which 
received 1,200 teaching applications this year, many from 
experienced teachers in eastern cities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors and officers of this bank, with some exceptions, felt that 
retailers are becoming more optimistic in their sales outlooks for 
the rest of the year. Reasons given for this optimism included such 
things as the recent signs that the slowdown nationwide may have 
bottomed out and the fact that people are not as uncertain about 
their employment status as they were a few months ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the directors, however, cited cases where retailers were not 
anticipating sales increases through the rest of the year. One 
director, from his observations of retailers in the Twin Cities, 
felt that they were becoming more conservative in their outlooks 
over the next year than they had been six months ago. Directors from 
agricultural sections of the District observed that retailers' 
outlooks were generally favorable, but that there was some concern 
about sales because of recent sharp drops in livestock prices and 
lower crop yields in some areas due to a lack of moisture.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast to the generally brighter retail sales outlook, District 
manufacturers do not expect any significant recovery in sales over 
the next six months. Respondents to our quarterly industrial 
expectations survey taken around the first of August revised their 
previous expectations downward. Sales in the current quarter are now 
expected to be only 2 percent greater than a year ago before rising 
in the next two quarters to about 4 percent above year-earlier 
levels. This finding is consistent with observations by this bank's 
directors. One case was cited in which a farm implement 
manufacturer, apparently overstocked with certain types of 
machinery, was offering large dealer discounts in order to move this 
machinery out of inventory. Another director felt that capital goods 
producers had been hurt by the recent cutbacks in plant and 
equipment expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are some indications that price increases at the retail level 
are becoming less prevalent than they were a few months ago. One 
director felt that although settlement of the recent teamsters' 
strike has resulted in some upward price adjustments, retailers are 
trying to cut down inventories by reducing prices. For example, boat 
sales were down this year, and dealers are selling them at only 
slightly above cost. Dry goods prices have remained essentially flat 
over the last few months, and increased competition from suppliers 
has held down price increases in men's wear. There is some 
indication that wholesale prices of men's suits have risen slightly 
in the last month or so, but retailers are shaving their margins in 
order to maintain prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors felt, however, that industrial price increases have 
not become less prevalent or less frequent than they were six months 
ago. With the exception of some price cutting to lower kinds of farm 
equipment inventories, the directors were not aware of any cases 
where industrial prices have been reduced. Moreover, they felt that 
industrial suppliers are still making across-the-board increases: U. 
S. Steel has announced a 5-percent increase for steel used in 
construction effective on November 16. This is essentially the same 
rate of increase posted on January 1 of this year, and it appears 
that other steel companies will follow U. S. Steel's lead. At the 
beginning of next year, the price of cement used in construction is 
also scheduled to rise about 5 percent, much the same as it did at 
the beginning of this year. In addition, users of foundry products 
recently faced a 
6-percent across-the-board price increase.
