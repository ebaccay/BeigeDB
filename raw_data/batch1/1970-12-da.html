      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The major portion of the data for this report was gathered in a 
survey of fourteen of the larger savings and loan associations in 
the Eleventh District. The associations surveyed reported: (1) Most 
associations had recorded deposit inflows since November 1969, with 
the weighted average rate of inflow of 4.0 per cent (2) The majority 
of associations had recorded increases in loans ranging from 2 to 15 
per cent, yielding the weighted average increase of 4.4 per cent 
since November of last year (3) Commitments at most of the 
institutions surveyed were up substantially over last year (4) 
Nearly two thirds of those surveyed had recently reduced their rate 
on home mortgages, with the most quoted rate in the range of 8 1/2 
per cent (5) About half of those surveyed felt that residential 
construction was being limited by huge construction costs (6) About 
half of the associations are now making loans on mobile home 
purchases, although these are fairly new loan programs (7) Most 
report that the price range of homes being constructed has risen 
somewhat in recent years, with the largest volume being constructed 
in the $20,000-$30,000 price range.
     </p>
     <p>
      General economic conditions continued to show a very moderate upward 
trend in the Eleventh District. Unemployment in Texas continues to 
remain well below the national average, while industrial production 
has edged upward slowly in recent months. Eleven out of the fourteen 
savings and loan associations surveyed had recorded fairly 
substantial deposit inflows since November of last year. Deposit 
inflows ranged from 2 to 15 per cent, with many in the 7 to 8 per 
cent range. Moreover, twelve of the fourteen showed an increase in 
loans over the period since November 1969, with eight of these 
associations recording annual growth rates for loans in excess of 5 
per cent. Most of the associations had commitments exceeding those 
in November 1969, with four of the associations showing commitment 
levels more than twice those of November of last year. Of the 
associations surveyed, nine reported that they had reduced the rates 
they charged on home mortgages. Most of these had reduced their 
rates by 1/4 to 1/2 per cent in recent months. The majority of the 
associations reported a current quotation of 8 1/2 to 8 3/4 per cent 
on home mortgages. Rates varied somewhat, with some associations 
charging 1 to 1 1/2 per cent origination fee. The 8 1/2-percent rate 
was typically on "prime" or "good conventional 80 percent" loans.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The majority of those surveyed felt that residential construction is 
being limited somewhat by construction costs. However, several felt 
that reduced interest rates might offset a portion of this high cost 
of construction. Should rates decline and additional mortgage money 
become available, most felt that only a very limited amount of 
demand for housing would continue to be deferred because of 
construction costs. However, one respondent noted that he expects 
the main volume of home building during the next five years to 
continue under the FHA or HUD programs. Half of those surveyed 
reported that they are now making loans on mobile home purchases. 
Since this type of loan is relatively new, only a few of the 
associations were able to supply figures on their volume of mobile 
home paper outstanding. Most of those participating in mobile home 
financing estimated that only a small portion of their deposit 
inflow will be channeled into such paper. One association estimated 
that in the future, about 6 to 8 per cent of its deposit inflow 
would go into mobile home financing. The majority of those surveyed 
indicated that homes in the price range of $20,000 to $30,000 
constituted the largest volume of homes being currently constructed 
in their areas. Most indicated that the general price range of homes 
being constructed had risen substantially (20 percent plus) since 
1967. However, three of the respondents indicated that a greater 
number of lower priced homes are being built now than in 1967, so 
that the proportion of higher priced homes being constructed has 
declined. A number of those surveyed indicated that, as funds become 
available, both short-term and long-term interest rates should 
decline and there should be an increase in the number of homes being 
constructed in all price ranges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Current levels of economic activity within the Eleventh District 
seem to indicate that the regional economy bottomed out sometime 
late this summer and is now showing a very moderate upward trend. 
Modest gains in industrial production have been made, as the decline 
in durable goods manufacturing was more than offset by high levels 
of nonmanufacturing and oil activity. The decline in durable goods 
was due mainly to declines in transportation equipment and 
machinery. The return of the auto workers to the GM assembly plant 
at Arlington, Texas, should have a positive effect on durable goods 
production; however, this may be partially offset by further 
downward adjustments in the aerospace industry. As a whole, 
industrial production in Texas during the first ten months of 1970 
has shown a significantly smaller increase than in previous years.
     </p>
     <p>
      There have been recent modest gains in employment in the District, 
with the unemployment rate for Texas running substantially below the 
national average. However, projected growth in the labor force is 
expected to outstrip gains in employment. Construction—particularly 
nonresidential construction—has shown some improvement in recent 
months, while department store sales in November were up only 3 per 
cent over the same month last year.
