      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       May 12, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>

      Recovery in the Fourth District is broadening. Manufacturers and 
  retailers note continued broadly based strength in consumer goods. 
  Steel operations are improving rapidly, and capital goods orders are 
  picking up from 1975's depressed levels. Sharp recovery in chemicals 
  and plastics, paperboard and containers, and certain types of steel 
  products has been accompanied by tightening supplies and a flurry of 
  price increases. Deposit flows into savings and loans continue to 
  outpace mortgage demand.
     </div>
     <p>
      Consumer spending continues strong except for small cars. One 
  Director noted continued strong consumer demand for household 
  materials for remodeling, and a banker Director described retail 
  sales and installment lending as extremely good. Delinquencies are 
  the lowest on record, repayments are strong, and consumers show no 
  reluctance to incur debt. The sharp rise in appliance production in 
  recent months has been an important factor in the recent surge in 
  steel orders. Recovery in consumer goods, however, is not without 
  some weak spots. A major producer of TV tubes reports that while 
  orders have been picking up they are still well below the peak of 
  late 1973. Also, operations at the GMC assembly plant at Lordstown, 
  Ohio remain curtailed because of excessive inventories of Vegas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The primary metals industry, which has lagged the overall recovery 
  is rebounding strongly. Operating rates in steel, which late last 
  year and early this year hovered around 70 percent, are now at about 
  90 percent of capacity. The surge in steel demand, however, is 
  confined largely to flat rolled products. Hedge buying against price 
  increases, coupled with strong demand from automotive and appliance 
  producers, ballooned orders this quarter, but some steel sources 
  expect orders next quarter will subside. One steel producer is 
  allocating orders for some sheet steel because of tight demand and 
  curtailed output stemming from relining of blast furnaces. Delivery 
  time on flat roll products has lengthened from 1 month to 3 or 4 
  months. Demand for structural steel and plates and other products 
  consumed by capital goods producers remains relatively weak and is 
  not expected to pick up until the fourth quarter. Orders for 
  aluminum also have been rising recently in response to higher demand 
  from automotive and packaging industries. The industry is operating 
  at about 75 percent of capacity, but steady improvement is expected 
  throughout the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The capital goods sector is showing signs of a comeback. A variety 
  of producers report a revival in orders from depressed levels in 
  early 1975. Heavy-duty truck orders spurted between the fourth 
  quarter 1975 trough and March 1976, although the March level was 60 
  percent of the peak in early 1975. Demand for bearings has increased 
  in recent weeks, reversing a declining trend in orders that lasted 
  into the early months of this year. One of the nation's largest 
  producers of machine tools reports orders in the first 4 months of 
  1976 rose 40 percent from a year earlier and exceeded shipments for 
  the first time in the last 18 months. An economist with a machine 
  tool builder doubts the 13 percent increase in capital spending 
  projected in the McGraw-Hill survey. According to him, time is 
  running out for 1976 delivery. Additionally, the spring survey in 
  recent years has been about 5 to 7 percent above actual spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tightening supply conditions are noted by several nondurable goods 
  producers in the District, especially the paperboard, plastics and 
  chemical products, and glass containers industries. Operations have 
  been boosted to 90 percent of capacity or higher for these 
  industries. Delivery schedules have tightened, but shortages have 
  not yet appeared. According to one source, shortages are not likely 
  to appear in paperboard and glass containers until capacity reaches 
  about 95 percent. Demand for plastics has boosted operations in 
  recent months close to the pre-recession peak. A petrochemical 
  producer reports that some of the industry's capacity has been lost 
  because of environmental restrictions.
     </p>
     <p>
      A flurry of price increases has accompanied strengthening in 
  markets. Prices for flat roll steel products will rise in June and 
  apparently some bar mill products are likely to increase, according 
  to one steel economist. Industry sources justify price increases 
  because of the high cost of additional capacity. A major bearings 
  producer announces a large price increase effective May, and 
  aluminum ingot prices are scheduled to rise about 6 percent early in 
  June. Several nondurable goods firms also report actual or 
  anticipated price increases for their products in order to finance 
  additional capacity. A plastics producer expects a 10 percent 
  increase in polypropylene this fall to support its new plant that 
  will double capacity by late 1977. Another source speculates that 
  paperboard prices are likely to rise in the third quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effects of the rubber industry strike, according to an economist 
  with a major tire producer, may be less widespread than generally 
  reported. He said 35 to 40 percent of the industry is still affected 
  by the strike. He expects that the auto industry will attempt to 
  adjust for the strike by eliminating spare tires in new trucks and 
  cars, accepting tires that were previously considered blemished, 
  upgrading tire quality, and increasing imports wherever possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loans generally report deposit inflows are stronger than 
  loan demand. At least two large associations no longer offer savings 
  certificates yielding 7-1/4 and 7-3/4 percent, and two others have 
  extended maturities on 7-3/4 percent certificates to 8 years. One 
  large association lengthened the maturity on 4 and 6 year 
  certificates to 10 years. As a result, net savings deposits have 
  declined since mid-April. Loans for multi-family housing remain 
  weak, and mortgage rates have eased to around 8 1/2 percent for a 70 
  percent loan although one association with a variable rate mortgage 
  lowered its rates to 8 1/4 percent. There is no indication of any 
  reduction in the passbook rate, although financial officers of 
  several associations are eager for such action.
