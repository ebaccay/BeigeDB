      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic recovery in the southwest has slowed, and although many 
  signs of strength are still evident, some areas of weakness are 
  currently hampering further overall improvement. This month's survey 
  touches on retail sales, construction, drilling activity, and cattle 
  feeding. The results suggest a mixed economic picture. New auto 
  sales are strong and the pace of residential housing starts is again 
  picking up after leveling sing off for four months. Moreover, 
  drilling activity should increase further over the remainder of the 
  year - especially if the interstate price of natural gas is raised. 
  Despite the areas of strength, department store sales have softened. 
  Highway construction remains one of the weakest sectors of the Texas 
  economy, and placements of calves in feedlots have slowed because 
  fed cattle prices have fallen well below production costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of new cars and pickup trucks are strong throughout the 
  District. The biggest demand continues to be for intermediate size 
  cars. Demand for large models is also up sharply largely because 
  General Motors plans to reduce the size of many large models in the 
  1977 production year to the intermediate size range. The auto 
  dealers surveyed feel the announced 6 percent price increase for the 
  1977 models has had no effect in stimulating purchases of the 
  remaining 1976 models. Inventory levels of intermediate and large 
  model cars and trucks are low, and some dealers are completely out 
  of the most popular models or will be before the 1977 models are 
  introduced. Inventories of compact cars, however, are plentiful as 
  sales of these models have not met previous sales expectations. 
  Large price discounts will likely be necessary to move the current 
  inventory of small cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most respondents in a survey of department store executives 
  described business as "pretty good" but pointed to a softening in 
  sales in the past few months. About half of the respondents felt the 
  softness was centered in durable goods, and about half felt the 
  weakness was largely in nondurable goods. Inventories are generally 
  on the "high side," but remain at manageable levels. As a result, 
  most department stores continue to take a conservative approach to 
  building inventories, and some have found the time required for 
  delivery of some goods has begun to stretch out. All respondents 
  felt retail sales would show steady improvement in the last half of 
  the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      After leveling off for four months, the pace of residential 
  construction in Texas has again begun to quicken. Most of the 
  activity continues to be in single family starts, but some builders 
  look to a significant improvement in multi-family construction by 
  the beginning of next year. One reason for the slower than normal 
  recovery in single family housing, according to a San Antonio 
  contractor, was the news media publishing stories that new homes 
  have become unaffordable. Another builder attributes the current 
  strength in new starts to the fact that people now see that they can 
  make mortgage payments despite higher prices and interest rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of single family housing, construction activity 
  in the southwest remains depressed, and one of the weakest sectors 
  is highway construction. In Texas, the growth in highway 
  construction funds has tapered off with slowdowns in both federal 
  funding and state tax revenues. And with road building costs rising 
  at an estimated 15 percent per year, actual construction put in 
  place is being sharply reduced. A few contractors have gone out of 
  business, while others are selling off used equipment and are 
  cutting back their work forces. The decline in demand for materials 
  used in road building is largely responsible for the depressed 
  market for construction steel and reduced output in the stone, clay 
  and glass industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the number of active drilling rigs in Texas is about 4 
  percent below the high levels attained a year ago, an increase began 
  a month ago and most industry spokesmen anticipate further gains in 
  drilling over the remainder of the year. But many drillers no longer 
  expect the gains to be as strong as anticipated two months ago. 
  Activity seems to be restrained by the rollback in prices for crude 
  oil, and many drillers report that proposed tax law changes and the 
  threat of divestiture could discourage investment in the industry. 
  Nevertheless, many independent drillers expect that the Federal 
  Power Commission will raise natural gas prices from $.53 per 
  thousand cubic feet to as much as $1.50 by September. If a large 
  increase is granted, exploratory drilling for gas should rise 
  sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Placements of calves in southwestern feedlots slowed considerably in 
  June from the increased levels of late 1975 and early 1976. Bankers 
  financing cattle feeders expect placements to remain low as fed 
  cattle prices have edged below feeder cattle prices and the cost of 
  grain. One banker reported that with current prices for fed cattle 
  around $40 to $41 per hundredweight and the cost of grain near $48 
  per hundredweight, cattle feeders are incurring heavy losses. 
  Considering the losses, cattle feeders and bankers are cautious 
  about placing new cattle on feed. Thus, the demand for feeder cattle 
  loans has weakened. The weakness in fed cattle prices apparently is 
  caused partially by the increased slaughter of heavier weight 
  grassfed calves as prices for feeder calves are restrained by the 
  lower demand for feedlot replacements.
