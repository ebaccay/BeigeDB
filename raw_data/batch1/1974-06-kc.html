      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <strong>
       June 12, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Major retailers in the Tenth District report modest sales increases 
over last year and appear moderately optimistic about the rest of 
1974. Sales of new domestic automobiles have grown more than 
seasonally in recent months, with some relative movement away from 
small cars. Lower livestock prices and prospects for a smaller wheat 
crop than was expected earlier may weaken the District farm income 
situation. However, little of the substantial decline in meat animal 
prices has shown up in retail meat prices. Although business loan 
demand at Tenth District banks remains strong, there are some 
indications that a slowdown in the growth of such loan demand may be 
under way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The retail sales picture continues to be mixed, according to reports 
from department stores across the Tenth District. Different firms in 
the same metropolitan area report widely differing growth in sales, 
along with the usual divergence from city to city. One major retail 
firm reports that its sales in rural areas are very good but that 
the sales picture in the metropolitan areas is "not so rosy." While 
furniture sales are apparently weak, sales of other consumer 
durables-especially appliances-seem to be fairly strong. Much of the 
inventory growth reported is said to be almost wholly in dollar 
terms, with some firms reporting declines in unit terms. Several 
firms emphasized the high holding costs for inventories as an 
important influence on their policies. Attitudes of the various 
respondents toward future sales may be summed up as moderately 
optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of new domestic automobiles seem to be showing slightly more 
than seasonal growth in recent months. Sales are shifting back to 
large- and intermediate-sized cars, compared to the December through 
February period. Buyers seem to be accepting standard engine sizes 
for a given model but continue to add options such as air 
conditioning and automatic transmission on all sizes of cars. There 
may be some movement away from such accessories as power windows and 
power seats. Reports on inventories vary so much from dealer to 
dealer that the situation is impossible to summarize.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales of imported cars in the Kansas City area have slipped 
substantially since February, with changing attitudes toward the 
fuel situation cited as the major reason. As a result, inventories 
are now very heavy. A Volkswagen dealer feels that the manufacturer 
simply guessed wrong on the duration of the gasoline shortage and 
the longer-run attitudes of car buyers, with inventories becoming 
"burdensome" as demand "fell apart."
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices and weather continue to dominate the agricultural picture. 
The latest report on sliding farm prices, which have now fallen 
about 14 percent since February, offers more evidence that 
processors and food retailers are allowing profit margins to widen 
before adjusting their prices. Hog and cattle prices are down 30 
percent and 12 percent, respectively, from a year ago, but the 
decline in red meat prices has been 3 percent or less. This 
reluctance to pass lower meat animal prices on to the consumer has 
slowed the movement of meat through the marketing chain and has 
contributed to an oversupply of heavy animals. Consequently, the 
livestock industry continues in a depressed financial state. 
However, on the basis of a recent telephone survey to a limited 
number of commercial bankers, most cattle loans have been adequately 
secured during the past year, thereby minimizing the number of bad 
loans. It was reported that a few rural banks may be in jeopardy 
because of poor cattle paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's wheat situation has not improved since the last Red 
Book. Various reports indicate that drought has destroyed much of 
the crop in New Mexico and Colorado. Given the recent planting 
difficulties in the spring wheat regions, 1974 wheat production may 
fall short of official estimates. However, the crop is still 
expected to surpass last year's record of 1.7 billion bushels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The volume of business loans declined substantially during May at 
weekly reporting banks, thereby providing some indication that 
business loan demand has perhaps begun to slow. Furthermore, in a 
survey of large District banks, several reported signs of a cooling 
in loan demand, as indicated by a reduction in the volume of new 
loan requests. However, other banks in the survey, in spite of 
experiencing a decline in business loans in May, still felt that 
business loan demand was exceptionally strong and was showing no 
signs of abatement. Whatever the future direction of loan demand 
might be, it. was the consensus among the surveyed banks that 
current loan demand was quite strong. As a result, virtually all 
banks were more actively policing compensating balance requirements 
and repayment schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
       District banks also experienced sizable inflows of CD's during May. 
In spite of press reports indicating that medium-sized banks might 
experience difficulty in attracting CD's in the wake of the problems 
at Franklin National Bank, apparently that was not the case with 
larger District banks. None of the surveyed banks reported having 
any difficulties in attracting and rolling over maturing CD's or 
having to pay a premium rate on CD's.
