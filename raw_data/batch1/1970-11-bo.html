      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 11, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      This month's discussions uncovered a further deterioration of the 
quiet confidence which had prevailed among District One Redbook 
respondents until early autumn. This shift—sensed more than heard in 
last month's talks—was made explicit in varying degrees by both our 
directors and our academic consultants. The members of the latter 
group in particular seem to have converged to a point where there is 
substantive agreement among them on policy issues.
     </p>
     <p>
      District One commercial banks continue to report results 
commensurate with the national experience: deposit flows are 
entirely satisfactory, and loan demand is flat to weak in all 
categories. One of our Class A Directors states that his institution 
has been investing large (for them) amounts in Federal funds for 
several months now, and is about to begin acquiring municipal 
obligations. Another Class A Director reports deposit increases of 
$80 million over a year ago. Of this amount only $10 million has 
been put into new loans while $70 million has been used to reduce 
debt. Loan-deposit ratios at this institution have dropped from 89 
percent last summer to a current 76 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area thrift institutions, too, have greatly improved their liquidity 
positions since mid-year, and many are once again building mortgage 
loan commitment levels. In line with this general picture mortgage 
rate reductions are finally beginning to appear in several 
communities scattered across the New England region. One banker did 
express concern, however, that an unusually high proportion of the 
pickup in mortgage activity is on existing structures, and that 
construction activity will be slow to benefit from easier mortgage 
market conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      More generally, area business conditions continue mixed. 
Recreational activity in the northern New England states is very 
good, and a great many of the region's manufacturers of industrial 
equipment and capital goods still have felt no slowdowns. There are 
perhaps more notable exceptions to this trend than there were a 
month ago; however, New England's precision tool and machine tool 
industries continue in a state of severe slack. New rounds of four- and eight-week layoffs—unforeseen as recently as a month ago—are now 
being planned for December and January at some firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Otto Eckstein, characteristically our most ebullient 
academic respondent over the summer months, seems to have shifted in 
recent weeks to a more moderate stance. Describing the U. S. economy 
as "sick, and getting sicker," Eckstein suggested that a fourth 
quarter nominal GNP gain of $7 to $8 billion now seems likely. While 
he still sees a strong spurt of GNP growth over the first half of 
1971 as likely to arise from the effects of steel hoarding and auto 
production catch-ups, Eckstein expects a third quarter 1971 decline 
in real GNP.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the housing outlook, Eckstein sees a relatively moderate 
resurgence as likely. His current projections have housing starts at 
a 1.75 million annual rate by the end of 1971, edging up to 1.8 
million and above in 1972. Eckstein emphasized that the nagging 
questions now lie more on the demand side of things, due to wealth 
effects, white collar unemployment, and consumer uncertainty. In 
money markets, Eckstein sees long rates (on AAA industrial bonds) as 
declining very slowly-perhaps 30 or 40 points by the end of 1971.
     </p>
     <p>
      On policy, Eckstein suggested three measures as appropriate now. 
First, he endorses a discount rate cut, solely for its announcement 
effects. Second, he now suggests a six to seven percent growth in 
the aggregates should be our target over the period from now to 
third quarter 1971. Finally, he strongly feels that the time is now 
overdue for an incomes policy. Specifically, this would take the 
form of the President himself calling together business and labor 
leaders for a closed session White House meeting. The crux of the 
Presidential message should be, first, that the Administration means 
business in its fight against inflation and, second, that the 
penalties for ignoring him will be continued high rates of 
unemployment. generally poor business conditions, public censure of specific groups, etc.
     </p>
     <p>
      <p>
       When Professor Wallich was queried on the use of incomes policy he 
replied, "Such policies are like prayer. If you know a good one that 
works you should use it." His approach would be one of a selective 
interim freeze on certain wages and prices. He stressed, however, 
that such an approach should be very temporary (six months or so), 
and removed before distortions and inequities begin to arise. On 
reducing the discount rate, Wallich would endorse such a move at the 
present time only if the mechanics of monetary policy are such that 
the System cannot otherwise achieve its aggregate and rate targets. 
As for specific aggregate targets, Wallich stated that the current 
growth path appears very low when viewed in real terms, and that 
seven percent would now seem warranted. This number represents a 
substantial shift toward stimulus on his part.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professor Tobin remains the most bearish of our academicians. He too 
would endorse an immediate discount rate cut, and additionally 
counsels us to keep pushing on the aggregates with a view to 
continued easing in rate levels. Nine to ten percent growth in Ml 
strikes him a appropriate to accommodate a closing of the GNP gap.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobin sees no real source of strength anywhere in the private 
sector, noting that any probable housing resurgence will come 
nowhere near offsetting the weakness in business investment that is 
developing. He further points out that we have experienced no great 
inventory decumulation and thus can expect no potential stimulus 
from that area. Tobin concluded by warning us to discount the 
argument that recent high savings rates will soon lead to consumers 
breaking out in a splurge. He points out that this ignores the 
wealth effects stemming from the stock market decline which are now 
very much in evidence in consumer behavior, and will continue to 
dominate it.
