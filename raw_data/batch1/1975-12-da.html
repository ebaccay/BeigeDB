      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Industrial output in the Eleventh District has risen steadily since 
last spring. The recovery in production, however, has been uneven 
among District industries. Those industries tied to the production 
of oil field equipment, such as fabricated metals and nonelectrical 
machinery, continue at boom levels. The output of chemicals has 
rebounded strongly. And apparel makers, deluged with new orders, are 
running at full production. This has meant strong demand for 
textiles and those chemical products used in synthetic fibers. But 
output in construction-related industries—most notably, primary 
metals—remains depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recovery in chemical production has been due, mostly, to 
rebuilding of stocks by users. This follows a period of heavy 
inventory liquidation. But now, producers report that new orders are 
being pushed up by widespread inventory speculation as price 
pressures mount in that industry. Prices of some basic plastics, 
such as monomers, were raised 25 to 30 percent in the summer and 
fall. As a result, users would like to build stocks further before 
the next round of price hikes, expected in January. But, they add, 
producers are largely preventing this by deliberately delaying 
shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent price increases have resulted in a severe cost-price squeeze 
for plastics user firms. Demand for their products has not 
strengthened enough, thus far, to allow these firms to pass the bulk 
of higher costs on to their customers. Consequently, a number of 
smaller firms are being pushed out of the market and are looking for 
larger firms to buy them out. The treasurer of one of the District's 
leading producers of plastic pipe said that in one week recently he 
received three such overtures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel manufacturers continue to step up production in response to 
a backlog of orders. Payrolls are being expanded and new plants are 
opening. And several garment makers are seeking sites for additional 
manufacturing facilities. Some clothing lines are sold out until 
February. And District firms generally feel retailers will continue 
to build inventories from current levels. An El Paso manufacturer, 
for example, reports that brisk sales at the retail level are 
forcing his customers to abandon the cautious ordering policies they 
had been practicing. One indication that retail stocks are still too 
low is that retailers are now accepting late shipments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel production at District mills is severely depressed. Output is 
down roughly 25 percent from a year ago. The largest steel mill in 
the District reports business is "horrible," with new orders running 
at the slowest pace of the year. The falloff has been centered in 
structural steel and has been due, primarily, to the steady decline 
in nonresidential construction in the Southwest in 1975. 
Manufacturers do not expect a substantial recovery in demand until, 
at least, mid-1976. And there is concern that when the recovery 
comes, a large part of the business will go to foreign producers. 
Today, foreign mills, particularly Japanese producers, are 
undercutting domestic steel prices by 20 to 25 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sluggish pace of construction activity has led to extremely 
aggressive bidding by manufacturers of building materials for new 
projects. A Fort Worth manufacturer of reinforcing steel bars said 
mills are engaged in the most aggressive price-cutting that he has 
seen in 25 years in the industry. Many jobs are actually being bid 
below cost as mills try to keep their share of the market and 
attempt to hold on to the backbone of their work force.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of independent oil producers reveals a consensus of opinion 
that the proposed energy legislation before Congress would be a 
disaster if enacted. The respondents feel changes are due but not in 
the direction of those proposed. Not only would changes now being 
considered roll back crude oil prices from an average of $8.75 per 
barrel to $7.66, but legislation would tighten the rules expensing 
intangible drilling costs. The latter change would reduce funds 
available for drilling and impact most severely on small 
independents, who account for much exploratory drilling. Passage of 
the legislation would not affect current drilling commitments, but 
thereafter, new commitments could fall off sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales have firmed at District dealerships. Compared with a 
year ago, sales in Dallas and Houston were up 54 percent and 32 
percent, respectively, in the mid-November reporting period. The 
market, however, is two-tiered. Demand is strong for the smaller 
economy cars and the large luxury models. In addition, customers are 
much more willing to buy optional equipment than a year ago. 
Inventories of new cars have been tight this fall. In one case, a 
leading dealer in North Texas sold 253 new cars in November, out of 
an inventory of 270 units. But factory shipments are expected to 
catch up with sales by year-end, and dealers are looking for 
continued improvement in sales in 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      On balance, labor markets in the District states continue to 
improve, as the rise in employment is outpacing the growth in the 
labor force. The number of jobholders is 2 percent above the level 
of a year ago, and the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.9 percent. 
Growth in employment in nonmanufacturing is faster than in 
manufacturing. Factory payrolls are up, bolstered by the increase in 
workers in nondurable goods industries. The average workweek in 
Texas also continues to edge upward, but employment in durable goods 
manufacturing in the District states is slow to recover. The number 
of construction jobs has increased but only with the ending of a 
series of strikes, and employment in the building trades remains 
substantially below the level a year ago.
