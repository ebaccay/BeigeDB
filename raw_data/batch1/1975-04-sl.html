     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Eighth District businessmen generally expressed more optimism than 
  heretofore about the prospects for an economic recovery later this 
  year. Although department store sales remain weak, unemployment 
  high, and general economic conditions relatively depressed, some 
  signs of recovery were observed. Most of those interviewed believe 
  that economic activity has bottomed out. Despite the low level of 
  construction, building representatives are generally optimistic. 
  Funds continue to flow into thrift institutions at a rapid rate, and 
  interest rates have declined from their peaks of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store representatives are still rather pessimistic. 
  Despite the early Easter, March sales at major Eighth District 
  outlets were not much above last year's level; thus the real volume 
  of sales was down. Retailers continue to report reduced sales of 
  big-ticket items. However, inventories are being reduced to minimum 
  levels and a turnaround in consumer demand could bring a quick 
  increase in orders to manufacturers. Car sales have also sagged in 
  the post-rebate period, although imported automobiles are apparently 
  selling fairly well.
     </p>
     <p>
      General manufacturing activity is difficult to gauge as 
  representatives of some industries reported worsening of conditions 
  and of others, improvement. Automobile manufacturing activity, for 
  example, has improved, as manufacturers expect an upturn in car 
  sales in the spring and summer months. One clothing manufacturer 
  reported the closing of some operations, while another was 
  increasing its workday. Still another reported current orders for 
  the fall season down considerably, but was fairly optimistic that 
  sales will pick up substantially in late spring since retailers have 
  reduced inventories below optimal stock levels. A plywood company 
  reported operations at high levels with increased sales. A 
  manufacturer of paint and coating felt the bottom of the decline had 
  been reached, but sales were 14% below a year ago. A substantial 
  drop-off in synthetic fiber sales was reported, while sales of 
  synthetic rubber and freon have increased. Manufacturers of small 
  farm implements and garden tools were highly optimistic, with 
  operations at very high levels and a high sales volume in prospect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several manufacturers are more optimistic than heretofore about 
  future conditions, even though sales at the moment do not justify 
  that optimism. Expansionary government policies are no doubt 
  contributing to the belief that the economy is currently at or near 
  the bottom of the recession, and that a substantial recovery will 
  soon begin.
     </p>
     <p>
      No major changes in business investment plans were reported as a 
  result of the recent tax concessions. As a general rule, firms 
  expect to implement their earlier spending plans which were quite 
  expansionary. Some, however, expressed the view that part of their 
  spending plans hinged on adequate financing at reasonable rates 
  which may be difficult to obtain in view of the level of prospective 
  government borrowing in the capital markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment continues up, reflecting the growing labor force and a 
  moderate decline in the employment level. Some improvement has been 
  registered for employment at automobile plants, but some other 
  industries report plant closings and further layoffs.
     </p>
     <p>
      An increase in housing sales and new housing starts was reported. 
  One builder stated that March was his best month since a year ago. 
  The tax credit recently passed for new home purchases is expected to 
  help clear existing housing inventories; however, areas such as St. 
  Louis, with a relatively small inventory of homes, will not be 
  helped much by this action.
     </p>
     <p>
      Funds continued to flow into S&amp;Ls at a relatively high rate in 
  March. The increase in savings so far this year has put downward 
  pressure on interest rates. Since mid-March, however, mortgage rates 
  have remained at about 8 1/2 percent. S&amp;Ls are reluctant to lend at 
  lower rates since lower rates received would require a change in 
  policies with regard to rates offered on CDs. They are reluctant to 
  make this change while considerable uncertainty remains concerning 
  the effects of government financing on credit markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan volume at commercial banks continued to decline in March 
  reflecting weak demand, and a further decline occurred in interest 
  rates. The volume of business loans declined, on balance, although 
  some increase was noted late in the month. Consumer installment 
  loans also continued to decline, reflecting the decline in sales of 
  big-ticket items such as cars, televisions, and furniture. The level 
  of time deposits at banks was little changed, as a small increase in 
  consumer-type savings deposits was about offset by a decline in 
  other time deposits.
