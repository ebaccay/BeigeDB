      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic prospects in the Sixth District economy appear to be 
  turning cautiously optimistic. Layoffs are still being reported but 
  not of the magnitude of the past few months. Local area businessmen 
  and directors' opinions are mixed concerning the impact of 
  automobile price rebates and post holiday retail sales. Generally, 
  sales seem to be holding up better than previously expected. Besides 
  auto rebates, several other instances of price cutting were reported 
  again this month. Industrial and commercial investment plans, 
  despite some retrenchment, remain reasonably strong in the face of 
  last year's weak economy and little improvement yet this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment in the District continues on the rise, as it does 
  nationally, but the extent of the rise varies throughout the region. 
  Florida and Georgia have been hardest hit, and unemployment rates in 
  these states are higher than the nation's. Both states are typically 
  well below the national unemployment rate. Alabama and Mississippi, 
  though showing some increases in unemployment, seem to be holding 
  their own. For example, Alabama steel producers are turning their 
  backs on new customers; producers indicate that their books are full 
  through 1975. Union Carbide Corporation announced a large expansion 
  ($9 million) at its steel mill in Gadsden, Alabama. Bessemer freight 
  car building plant, the world's largest and most diversified 
  facility of its type, is booked solid with orders through this year. 
  Reports of job layoffs are fewer and more scattered than in the 
  previous 2 or 3 months. South Central Bell will lay off 250 
  employees in Alabama and will trim capital spending by $82 million. 
  A large Florida truck-trailer company has laid off one-half its work 
  force. Three hundred workers will be furloughed by the Tennessee 
  Valley Authority. A Louisiana paper mill which makes liner board 
  used by many national companies has closed down, idling 335 workers. 
  A large plywood manufacturer has also recently shut down its 
  facilities. North Georgia's carpet industry has recently predicted 
  that 1975 will be a better year than previous bleak forecasts have 
  indicated. At a recent carpet industry meeting, an industry 
  representative reported that January 1975 sales surpassed those of a 
  year ago. Alabama's textile industry is also expecting a good year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regional auto dealers are reporting improvement in sales as a result 
  of the rebate programs. Florida directors indicated that sales are 
  up from previous months but still below year-ago levels. Sales are 
  restrained, however, by the availability of credit. Showroom traffic 
  has been very heavy. However, heavy-duty truck sales have fallen to 
  the lowest point in many years in Central Florida. New Orleans 
  directors report mixed responses to rebates. A New Orleans area 
  director noted that the rebates have materially enhanced showroom 
  traffic but not new car sales. A Mobile, Alabama director reports 
  that the rebate has boosted sales significantly and that dealers are 
  very enthusiastic. Three Baton Rouge, Louisiana car dealers 
  indicated that the rebates were responsible for 50- to 100-percent 
  sales increases. But it was interesting to note that each of the 
  three dealers stated that they are now worried about what will 
  happen to auto sales when the rebate program ends. A survey of 
  Alabama auto dealers indicates that rebates have caused great 
  increases in showroom traffic and substantial increases in sales, in 
  some cases over 100 percent at 23 major dealers around the state. It 
  was also reported that several large Alabama industries with ties to 
  the auto industry were giving $100 rebates to employees who 
  purchased new cars.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales seem to have held up fairly well in January. Directors' 
  responses to questions regarding the extent preholiday sales 
  campaigns siphoned off January sales were mixed. At least two 
  reports of strong January sales were received. One indicated that 
  retail stocks were the lowest in years, creating a problem until 
  spring delivery of merchandise. A Central Florida retailer, however, 
  believes that December sales promotions did eat into January sales. 
  Louisiana directors reported that retailers were satisfied with 
  January sales levels. Apparently, December promotions did not drain 
  January sales. A report from the Alexandria, Louisiana area, 
  however, indicates that retail sales are sluggish and not responding 
  to intense price promotions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last month we reported a surge in holiday tourist traffic in 
  Florida. In early January, tourist activity fell off drastically but 
  has rebounded again, at least in Central and South Florida. One 
  director reports that businessmen in central Florida seem to have a 
  renewed air of optimism since the first of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Besides the car rebates, several instances of price cutting were 
  noted. A South Florida area retailer indicates that at present 
  inflation is dead in soft goods. He notes that there is weakness in 
  both apparel and textile goods prices. An Alabama apparel retailer 
  indicates that while leisure wear is selling well, men's clothing is 
  one area where inventories remain abnormally high. He notes that 
  they are now in a whole new ball game for clothing manufacturers; 
  they have adjusted their thinking, and it appears now that prices 
  for fall 1975 will be reduced from fall 1974 prices. There is 
  considerable price cutting on Florida's housing, condominium, and 
  rental-unit markets. Direct cuts have appeared in resale markets, 
  while discounts, "free gifts," no leases, no deposits, and low 
  early-months' rent are being offered on new home and rental housing. 
  One Florida director reports that 55 townhouses previously priced in 
  the $55,000-range were reduced to $36,000; within a week they were 
  all sold. Savings inflows continue at savings and loans throughout 
  the District. These institutions, particularly in Florida and the 
  Atlanta area, are now beginning to seek new mortgage commitments. 
  Rates have been reported in the 8 3/4- to 9-percent range by some 
  savings and loans.
