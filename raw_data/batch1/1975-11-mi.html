      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions continued to show improvement in the Ninth 
District. Retail sales have been quite strong this fall, and 
prospects are for a good holiday season. District automobile sales 
have also strengthened. Many district businesspeople have brought 
their inventories into balance. Another encouraging development was 
the third-quarter improvement in district farm income. Finally, loan 
demand has increased at district commercial banks in recent months.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       District retail spending improved this fall, and the outlook is good 
for the holidays. A recent survey of major Minneapolis-St. Paul area 
retailers reported stronger sales of clothing, home improvement 
materials, and big-ticket items like appliances and furniture. This 
sales pickup has made the Twin Cities area retailers optimistic 
about their sales prospects for the holiday season and next year. 
One director, whose company manufactures consumer products, 
indicated that consumer spending has accelerated and stated that his 
firm's sales to retailers point toward a good holiday season. 
Directors from outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area 
reported that fall retail sales have generally been good in their 
areas and the outlook is for sales to continue strong through the 
holidays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Growing strength was apparent not only in general merchandise sales 
but also in automobile sales. A Montana director described recent 
automobile sales in his state as "super." A southern Minnesota 
director reported this fall's auto sales improved after being down 
this summer, and in western South Dakota consumers have been showing 
considerable interest in the 1976 models. In addition to the 
strength in car sales, one director reported that truck sales in his 
area were up considerably.
      </p>
      <p>
       Excess inventories have no longer been a problem for many 
businesses. One Minneapolis-St. Paul area director expressed the 
view that most businesses have pretty well adjusted their 
inventories. Two directors indicated that retailers have been 
cautious about inventories and may encounter some difficulty 
obtaining merchandise as merchants seek to obtain goods to meet 
unanticipated demands this holiday season. A western South Dakota 
director, on the other hand, stated that businesspeople in his area 
have still been trying to cut inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our October Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey, farm 
income prospects in the Ninth District improved in the third quarter 
over previous quarters. In this most recent survey, 29 percent of 
the district's bankers reported farm earnings above year-ago levels; 
in the first half of 1975, fewer than 10 percent of the bankers 
reported improved farm earnings.
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of factors contributed to the recently improved income 
prospects. High prices from hogs and fat cattle boosted some 
farmers' profits. Other farmers' incomes were increased by higher 
dairy prices. Better yields were also a factor in raising farmers' 
earnings, most noticeably in the wheat belt of North Dakota.
      </p>
      <p>
       By no means all bankers reported farm earnings higher than those of 
1974. Earnings have been down from last year in the flood-ravaged 
regions of the Red River Valley, and midsummer drought conditions 
reduced crop yields through areas of South Dakota and southwestern 
Minnesota. Finally, earnings remained low for the district's cow-calf operators, who are in the second year of an adjustment process 
that many bankers expect will continue through 1976.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan growth—apart from seasonal advances—was much stronger in 
September and October than earlier in the year at district banks. 
Part of this increase has occurred in business loans at large banks 
in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. Outside the Twin 
Cities the situation has been mixed. Three directors located near 
the Twin Cities reported that loan growth has been quite strong in 
their areas. Two cited strong real estate loan demand, and one 
indicated that installment lending was up in his area. On the other 
hand, a Montana director indicated no increase in loan demand in his 
area. The poor outlook for the livestock industry and the lingering 
effects of the recession are expected to hold down loan demand in 
western South Dakota.
      </p>
      <p>
       The October Agricultural Credit Conditions Survey also indicated 
that agricultural loan demand was not expected to increase in the 
third and fourth quarters. Short-term loan demand has slowed 
considerably since the July survey. With earnings slightly improved 
over the first half of 1975 and with slower farm spending, farmers' 
financial positions have stabilized. Farmers have been paying off 
old debts, and refinancing of farm loans has declined. Also, farm 
credit needs have turned down seasonally. Advance stockpiling of 
inputs may also be lower than last year, when fears of input 
shortages appear to have encouraged extensive stockpiling.
      </p>
      <p>
       With farm income prospects improving, bankers have been viewing farm 
lending more favorably. Sixty-one percent of the bankers reported 
that they actively sought new loan accounts during the third 
quarter, the highest percentage since the second quarter of 1974. 
Only 8 percent of the bankers reported that they had reduced or 
refused a loan due to a fund shortage, and only 4 percent 
anticipated problems meeting loan demand in the coming months.
