      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The major regional economic indicators suggest that business 
  conditions in the Eleventh District have begun to strengthen. 
  Although mining output is off, production in manufacturing is up 
  sharply, led by large gains in such major nondurable goods 
  industries as chemicals and refining. Housing starts in Texas are at 
  the highest level since January 1973, and there are 19,000 more 
  construction jobs than a year ago. The growth in total employment in 
  the Southwest has reduced the unemployment rate to 6.3 percent from 
  a peak of 7.0 percent in September 1975. This month's survey 
  suggests that new car sales are climbing again, and new orders for 
  women's and children's clothing have picked up. Total bank loan 
  demand remains on a plateau, but loan demand for multifamily 
  construction and irrigation farming is increasing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for new automobiles appears to be growing, following a lull 
  in sales during September and early October. Part of the recent 
  increase, however, is attributable to fleet sales that obscure 
  underlying consumer demand. However, all auto dealers interviewed 
  anticipate strong sales during the 1977 model year. A few dealers 
  expect sales will pick up significantly now that the Presidential 
  election is over. There is no indication of unfavorable consumer 
  reaction to the reduction in size of GM models or to the average 6-percent increase in new car prices. Some used car sales, however, 
  are attributed to higher prices for new cars. Almost all dealers 
  indicate that their inventories are lower than they would like. Ford 
  dealers are experiencing a slow pickup in deliveries since the auto 
  strike ended, and GM dealers report that it is difficult to get 
  enough of the most popular models.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook for apparel sales is mixed, according to market 
  observers at recent showings of spring merchandise at the Dallas 
  Apparel Mart. The number of buyers at the women's and children's 
  market was 10 percent higher than a year ago, and the volume of new 
  orders was up an estimated 20 percent. Inventories at most buyer 
  outlets—largely "mom and pop" stores—were reported to be low. The 
  biggest price increases were reported for articles made of denim and 
  for children's wear. For all goods, higher priced merchandise tended 
  to sell better than medium- or low-priced goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      New orders for men's clothing were off at the latest market. Partly 
  because few style innovations have occurred in the past two years, 
  consumers appear content with their current wardrobes. Some price 
  increases in men s clothing have occurred, especially for shirts and 
  worsted goods. Industry spokesmen note that consumer price 
  resistance for men's suits begins at about $165 in department 
  stores, while price resistance for similar goods sold in specialty 
  clothing stores begins at about $200.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interviews with District bankers suggest that business loan demand 
  continues "disappointedly flat" and in some cases is falling. The 
  long anticipated turnaround has not appeared, and several bankers 
  now put off to mid-1977 an expected rise in business loan demand. 
  Loans to the petroleum industry for drilling and developing fields 
  continue to be the only area of significant strength. Although 
  commercial and industrial loans remain weak, loans to local firms, 
  in contrast to national firms, have been coming in better.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer loan demand is lackluster. With the exception of the 
  Houston area, there is little or no growth in credit card usage or 
  delinquencies. A Fort Worth banker reported that repayments in 
  credit card accounts are outstripping sales, and a Dallas banker 
  noted the high level of savings was impeding growth in consumer loan 
  demand. New car loans are weak because many purchases are being 
  financed through sales finance companies. Several bankers indicated 
  that real estate loans—especially for construction of multifamily 
  housing—have bottomed out and appear to be in an initial state of 
  recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Country bankers report that operating loans for irrigation farming 
  are being spurred by sharply higher production costs and lower 
  market prices for grain. But bankers are firming collateral 
  requirements as a means of reducing loan risks. And many bankers 
  indicate that the net worth of borrowers will become a more 
  important factor in the evaluation of farm loans in the future. A 
  banker in the High Plains of Texas stated that marginal tenant 
  farmers will likely have difficulty in obtaining sufficient 
  operating capital next year to meet their projected needs. Another 
  banker reported that financing of many tenant farmers will likely 
  require more participation of the Farmers Home Administration and/or 
  the Small Business Administration in making guaranteed loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the bankers interviewed indicated that with continued 
  expectations for an impending rise in loan demand, they plan to 
  maintain a liquid investment portfolio. Because the tax-exempt 
  advantages of municipal obligations are currently less attractive, 
  the major portion of new acquisitions is mainly comprised of U.S. 
  Treasury issues. More banks, however, are lengthening the maturity 
  structure of their investment portfolios somewhat in order to obtain 
  the higher rates of return available on intermediate-term Government 
  securities and, thus, help offset the slower growth in income from 
  loans.
