      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 15, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Comments from our directors and other executives in the District 
  reflect the deepening recession. Retail trade has been poor, and 
  consumers are extremely pessimistic. Layoffs have been widespread 
  and widely publicized. The underlying situation in the capital goods 
  sector is deteriorating. The steel industry which has been a major 
  source of strength, says a decline in demand is imminent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers in the Cleveland area generally experienced a late spurt 
  in sales during the week just prior to Christmas (when the two daily 
  newspapers resumed publication following a seven-week shutdown). 
  Sales for the holiday season as a whole were considered poor. Some 
  major department and discount stores reported the dollar volume of 
  sales on a par with the previous year's sales. Retailers noted a 
  change in buying patterns as consumers bought more functional gifts 
  (e.g., pocket calculators) and did much more comparative shopping 
  than usual. A director with a national retail concern said that both 
  low-priced items and high-priced luxury goods (e.g., furs) sold 
  well, while middle-priced items moved sluggishly. Their inventories 
  are in good shape. This director expressed the view that consumer 
  confidence is at the lowest level since the mid-1930's; he also 
  believes that consumers' real purchasing power will continue to 
  decline for three or four more quarters. Another director noted that 
  gloom and pessimism among consumers in western Ohio is thick. Farm 
  implement dealers are said to have heavy inventories of goods, 
  although there are selective items in tight supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the industrial sector, economic conditions are deteriorating 
  rapidly. The December report of Cleveland purchasing agents shows 
  the largest decline in new orders since December 1957, accelerated 
  declines in employment and output, continued reduction of raw 
  materials inventories, and the beginning of inventory liquidation of 
  finished goods. On the encouraging side, purchasing agents reported 
  a further slowing in the rate of inflation; many are paying lower 
  prices. Early returns from our survey of manufacturers also reflect 
  a deepening of recessionary forces, with declines in new orders and 
  employment spreading among industries throughout the District. 
  Layoffs have been pervasive, particularly among the auto companies 
  and suppliers. (Widespread publicity given to the depressing
  situation in the auto industry may be contributing to adverse 
  consumer psychology.) However, one of our directors in the 
  automotive supply business stated that the effects of unemployment 
  in the auto-related areas are cushioned because of supplemental 
  unemployment benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sharp reductions in natural gas supplies to industrial firms 
  throughout the District are contributing further to cutbacks in 
  employment and output. Truck component manufacturers are cutting 
  employment in response to an increasing number of cancellations of 
  heavy truck orders. All the tire companies in the District have cut 
  their work forces in an attempt to reduce heavy inventories of 
  tires, estimated by one industry source to be seven months' supply. 
  But sales are falling faster than output can be reduced. One major 
  tire firm said their tire replacement sales in December were off 25 
  percent from the depressed year-earlier volume. Tire dealers say 
  customers are postponing purchases and wearing tires down to the 
  bare bones. Tire sales for trucks plummeted in December; the only 
  strength remaining in tires stems from farm machinery and mining 
  equipment producers. Despite weakness in the tire market, 
  manufacturers are holding list prices, but consumers are negotiating 
  with dealers at below list.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two major steel firms say the recession thus far has had little 
  impact on their order rate. The companies are shipping everything 
  they can produce. However, a sharp drop in demand is expected this 
  quarter. Raw steel output recently has been below capacity because 
  of shortages of coke and coal, but deliveries are returning to 
  normal. Steel output during 1975 is not expected to decline as much 
  as shipments, because steel-mill inventories have been depleted and 
  will be rebuilt. One industry source expects a surge in steel 
  imports this year to a record level.
     </p>
     <p>
      The machine tool industry continues to experience a weakening in 
  demand, according to three large producers in the Cleveland area. 
  New orders and backlogs are declining, while cancellations have 
  risen sharply (largely from auto firms and suppliers to the auto 
  industry). One producer reported that cancellations in December 
  again exceeded orders (orders fell to two units while cancellations 
  rose to 38, about equal to one month's production). Another firm, 
  which does not rely heavily on the auto market, said it has a large 
  enough machine-tool backlog for producers of agricultural and 
  oil-drilling equipment to sustain operations through this year. But new 
  orders have slowed; if there is no pickup soon, the firm will cut 
  employment in 1976 (reflecting the long engineering lead time).
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all of our industrialist directors report that their firms 
  are experiencing a deterioration in business. This is being 
  reflected in new orders, prices, and some easing in materials costs, 
  but rising labor costs, coupled with poor productivity, is a major 
  problem. Some directors expressed deep concern over the lack of 
  capital formation (particularly among utilities) and the long-run 
  inflationary implication of this situation. In general, the 
  directors believe a fundamental economic correction is under way. In 
  their view, anti-inflationary policies are wrong and the Fed should 
  not move to provide massive stimulus to offset unemployment. The 
  likely outcome of too stimulative a policy would be a rekindling of 
  inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the financial sector, one of our Bank directors noted a sizable 
  decline in consumer and business loans at the 
  year-end. Another said 
  that reports from their loan officers indicated that auto dealer 
  customers had large loan losses in December.
