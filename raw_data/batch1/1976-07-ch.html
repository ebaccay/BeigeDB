      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic outlook continues favorable in the Seventh District, 
  although the pace of the upswing probably has moderated since the 
  first quarter. Unemployment has declined significantly in all major 
  centers, but remains high compared to pre-recession levels, 
  especially in Michigan. Despite publicized reports of weaker 
  national performance of employment and retail sales in recent 
  months, there is little apprehension in the District that the 
  general expansion is near a peak. Motor vehicles and many types of 
  smaller capital goods are selling well, but orders for heavy capital 
  goods continue slow. Various equipment producers, however, express 
  confidence that new orders will strengthen in the next six months or 
  so. Single-family home construction continues at a high level, but 
  other construction sectors remain depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Executives continue to be cautious on commitments to increase 
  investments in inventories and plant and equipment, and on new 
  hirings. In large part, this reflects still-fresh memories of the 
  excesses of 1973-74. But they complain of various government 
  regulations that restrict managerial discretion, and there is 
  apprehension that this fall's elections will produce a less stable 
  political environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most firms either are adding to staff or, at least, are not cutting 
  back. Help-wanted advertising in the Chicago area rose significantly 
  in March and since then has been running 80 percent above year-ago, 
  and has been very close to the level that prevailed in 1973 and in 
  1974 until September when a sharp decline began.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capacity continues to be ample in virtually all sectors. However, 
  new cuts in natural gas allotments have been announced for the 
  winter season. Limited availability of gas supplies is reported to 
  be deterring expansion of industrial firms in Wisconsin. A recent 
  heat wave in Indiana caused reductions in electric power available 
  to manufacturers. Possible shutdowns of nuclear plants present a 
  continuous threat to power supplies. Lead times on new orders for 
  materials and components have stretched out further, partly because 
  suppliers are reluctant to increase staff. On the brighter side, oil 
  companies are less concerned about gasoline shortages this summer 
  because refinery operations have been adjusted to increase supplies 
  more readily than had been expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Opening steps have been taken to exploit a substantial body of 
  copper ore in Northern Wisconsin. A Chicago steel firm contracted 
  recently with partners to substantially expand two iron mines in 
  Northern Michigan that produce low-grade ore which is converted into 
  pellets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Various firms have taken steps to assure future supplies of 
  materials and components against a recurrence of the bottlenecks of 
  1973-74. They have expanded their own facilities, purchased plants 
  of smaller companies, and have attempted to arrange firmer 
  commitments from suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some retailers were disappointed by sales results in May and June, 
  but they do not appear to have lowered their sights for the year as 
  a whole. The extent of sales promotions of seasonal merchandise 
  since July 4 does not suggest a heavy overhang of goods. Appliance 
  sales have been somewhat weaker than expected, especially 
  refrigerators and freezers. The failure of appliance sales to expand 
  further may reflect large purchases of autos and other vehicles, 
  heavy vacation spending, and the higher proportion of new housing 
  units represented by single-family homes.
     </p>
     <p>
      As the 1976 model year draws to a close, shortages of popular 
  intermediate- and full-sized cars are cited more frequently. Gluts 
  of some small cars are substantial. The smallest auto producer, 
  which concentrates on small cars, stopped assembly of 1976 models on 
  June 25, several weeks earlier than usual. The "Big Three" are 
  pushing large car output to the limit, mainly using overtime rather 
  than extra shifts. Local strikes at crucial plants have impeded auto 
  production. The model changeover period apparently will be shorter 
  than had been expected earlier, but new models will not be produced 
  on the same assembly lines as old models (as in the past) because 
  many 1977 models are "not compatible." Availability of tires is not 
  an immediate problem despite the long strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      The heaviest trucks are now selling well again and the uptrend in 
  sales of lighter trucks, with an increasing share going to 
  consumers, remains "phenomenal." Demand for semi-trailers has picked 
  up at least as fast as sales of heavy trucks. Farm equipment sales, 
  especially heavy tractors, have exceeded expectations and 
  inventories in the field are moderate. Export sales of farm 
  equipment also have been strong. Sales of lumbering equipment, lift 
  trucks, and smaller construction equipment are well above recession 
  lows.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output of some types of heavy equipment remains at high levels, but 
  backlogs for virtually all types continue to shrink. The volume of 
  inquiries and quotes have been at a good level, however, and firm 
  orders are expected to increase as the general expansion continues.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent and prospective increases in steel prices are expected to 
  hold up. Cold-rolled sheets are "effectively on allocation." Demand 
  for heavier steel products has increased somewhat. Steel mills, like 
  most other manufacturers, will schedule normal summer vacations this 
  year, despite lengthened lead times.
     </p>
     <p>
      Single-family homes continue to lead construction. For the first 
  five months home permits in the Chicago area were close to the high 
  levels of the early 1970's, but apartment permits were only a 
  fraction of that level. Apartments have accounted for only 30 
  percent of Chicago area permits this year, compared to almost 60 
  percent in 1971 and 1972. Commercial and industrial construction 
  prospects remain poor through year-end. Sales of mobile homes have 
  increased sharply from last year's low level, but no early approach 
  to peak rates of 1972-73 is anticipated.
