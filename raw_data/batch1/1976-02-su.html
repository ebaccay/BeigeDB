      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Strong retail sales are the key to a generally optimistic outlook 
for the Redbook this month. Nearly every District focuses attention 
on the strength of consumer demand as an indication that the economy 
may be regaining some of the momentum it lost in the latter months 
of 1975. The picture is still far from rosy, but the outlook is 
distinctly more optimistic. Even though capital goods industries are 
still weak, the rest of the manufacturing sector is gaining 
strength. Inventories have been brought into line with sales and new 
orders are up. Two persistent weak spots—the construction 
industry's slump and high urban 
unemployment—remain gloomy, but 
inflationary pressures seem to be moderating in several Districts. 
While there is little disagreement that "catch-up" efforts in wage 
negotiations scheduled for 1976 pose a problem for stabilizing 
production costs, there are differences of opinion on the likelihood 
that food prices will rise significantly during the next few months. 
The financial sector continues to build liquidity rather than 
expand. Savings are flowing into commercial banks and thrift 
institutions at very rapid rates. This is putting downward pressure 
on mortgage rates. However, despite low interest rates for business 
loans, demand for credit remains sluggish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports from 10 of the 12 Districts indicate that the surge of 
retail sales experienced in December was no fluke. In each case, the 
bulk of the gains recorded at the end of 1975 were preserved through 
January. "Big-ticket" items are leading the sales surge in most 
areas. Cars, trucks, appliances and furniture are all selling well. 
Chicago, Philadelphia and Minneapolis note that apparel sales are 
also strong. In general, retailers appear to have their inventories 
at levels which they feel are sustainable and are increasing their 
stocks only to the extent needed to meet revised sales forecasts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The manufacturing sector continues its upswing. Cleveland notes that 
steel producers are experiencing a gradual recovery while Kansas 
City and Chicago both point to rising sales forecasts as a spur to 
automobile production in their Districts. In most industries 
manufacturing inventories are now either in line with sales or 
nearly so. Dallas reflects the findings of most District Banks in 
reporting that business continues to be reluctant to rebuild 
inventories now that stocks have been cut back. The manufacturing 
sector's advances seem to be most hesitant in the Richmond District. 
That region had experienced substantial improvement in late 1975, 
but this month's report indicates a retrenchment may be occurring. 
New orders and backlogs both softened during January in that 
District. Capital goods manufacturers have yet to participate fully 
in the recovery, and in the Boston District capital goods orders are 
still "feeble." St. Louis and Minneapolis report similar weakness. 
Cleveland describes farm machinery and mining equipment as "holding 
up well," while Richmond's machinery and equipment group is one of 
the few sectors showing progress in that region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The construction industry remains in the doldrums throughout much of 
the country. Residential and nonresidential construction activity 
were both lower last quarter in the Cleveland District, and Boston's 
real estate and housing markets remain "depressed." Atlanta finds 
itself with very large amounts of vacant office space that resulted 
from overbuilding. However, the city is trying to turn substantial 
recent additions to its hotel room capacity into a plus by searching 
for more convention business. The San Francisco District reports 
that its stock of unsold housing and high building costs are 
continuing to discourage new residential construction even though 
mortgage rates are dropping.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been relatively little progress so far in reducing the 
nation's unemployment problem. Chicago finds that "job markets are 
improving gradually but unemployment remains very burdensome in the 
inner cities." St. Louis finds its region in a similar situation. 
The Dallas region is one of the few in the country where the problem 
is not severe. Increasing job opportunities in the oil industry have 
helped to bring the area's unemployment rate below 6 percent. By 
contrast, San Francisco reports the opposite problem since its 
area's aircraft industry is once again badly depressed and its 
employment is dropping.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best that can be said of inflation is that it may be moderating. 
Prices continue to rise virtually everywhere, but no District 
reports any unusual increases. New York and Kansas City both note 
predictions from sources in their Districts that food prices will be 
declining in the months ahead—courtesy of good harvests, heavy 
plantings and intensified preparation of livestock for meat 
production. The Chicago District report, however, disputes this 
forecast. New York, Richmond, Chicago and Minneapolis all mention 
the concern that "catch-up" raises will be the objective of 1976 
wage bargaining.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current outlook for agriculture is mixed. With the exception of 
soybeans, forecasts call for planting additional acreage in most 
major crops. The outlook for 1976 crop harvests at this point is 
generally positive. However, farm income is currently under pressure 
because of declining grain prices. According to the Minneapolis 
report, the price decline is also resulting in slow debt repayment 
and requests for additional inventory financing at rural banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The situation of the country's banking community has not changed 
substantially in recent weeks. Savings inflows are generally strong, 
while business loan demand continues to be weak. For instance, 
Richmond reports that some of the banks in its District are 
experiencing unusually low levels of credit line utilization. Even 
aggressive loan pricing efforts (Philadelphia) are producing little 
new business. The Dallas District banks seem to be relatively busy 
with agricultural and consumer loans. But despite the comparative 
strength of that region's economy, commercial loan growth is 
described as "lackluster." The only development of significance is 
the downward pressure that savings inflows are putting on mortgage 
rates, especially in thrift institutions. Boston, Cleveland and 
Chicago all report declining financing costs for mortgage loans.
