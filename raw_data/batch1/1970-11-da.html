      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 11, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The data for this report were gathered in a survey of
      <br/>
      twenty-four of 
the larger retail stores in the Eleventh District. The retailers 
surveyed reported (1) most stores had experienced a downtrend in 
sales earlier in 1970 but have noticed a pickup in buying and store 
traffic in the last two months; (2) about half of those surveyed 
noted that the prices on goods they purchase are still increasing—some at a slightly lower rate; (3) over half of the retailers 
mentioned that prices on the goods they sell are still rising—but, 
again, at a somewhat slower pace in recent days; (4) the majority 
noticed a trend toward stable or rising sales volume in suburban 
stores, while most central city stores had experienced a downtrend 
in sales, especially during the past year; (5) there appears to be 
increasing price awareness on the part of the consumers and many 
stores noted a shift toward low to medium priced goods; (6) the 
relationship between discount stores and department stores does not 
appear to have changed significantly, although the number of 
discount houses appears to be rising; and (7) over half of the 
stores expect sales during the upcoming holiday season to be heavier 
than during the same period in 1969.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite sluggish sales recorded earlier in the year, thirteen of the 
stores reported substantially heavier buying and store traffic 
during the past two months. Although consumers appear somewhat more 
cautious in buying, people seem to be responding well to promotional 
price appeal ads, and buying volume has increased. One store noted 
that despite some slack in sales earlier in the year, this would be 
their best year in history. Another retailer noted that last 
September (1969) was the beginning of a downtrend in sales, but now 
October (1970) the opposite feeling seems to prevail.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to price changes, the picture is not quite so 
optimistic. Twelve out of the twenty-four retailers surveyed 
reported that prices on goods purchased are continuing to rise. Some 
felt that prices are not accelerating as fast as earlier this year—but, there was still concern over rising prices. However, price 
rises are more spotty and across-the-board increases are not as 
widespread. Prices of goods sold also seem to be rising—order to 
cover cost, since profit margins have already been reduced. One 
retailer did report that his store was attempting to reduce prices 
on a few of their most highly competitive lines.
     </p>
     <p>
      With a general softness in sales during most of 1970, central city 
stores have fared worse than most suburban outlets. Most of the 
retailers reported stable or rising sales volume at suburban stores, 
while downtown stores struggle to hold their own. However, a number 
of the retailers noted that as sales have increased recently, some 
downtown stores are improving their sales volume. Only one retailer 
reported a substantially larger sales volume at their central city 
store.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of the retailers mentioned an "increasing price awareness" 
on the part of consumers. Consumers are concerned with prices, but 
also tend to demand quality for the price paid. There has been a 
recent trend away from the really expensive items—and toward the 
medium-to-low priced goods. However, consumers seem to relate prices 
to quality for all price ranges. One store noted that the better 
buyer of former years has suffered losses in the stock market and is 
not buying up to normal capacity. Many of those surveyed felt that 
quality is more important when consumers are being selective. 
However, the trend seems to be reversing and a few retailers felt 
consumers would become somewhat less price conscious in future 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      With the recent increase in discount store outlets, many retailers 
felt that competition has become keener. Although Sunday closing 
laws have taken some edge away from discount stores, one retailer 
noted that the increase in "square footage" alone has probably 
shifted the balance toward the discount outlets. Many of the items 
offered by moderate and higher priced stores are not available at 
the discount centers; however, for lower priced items, the 
forcefulness of large discount operations makes competition quite 
keen as a number of retailers noted-customers are very aware of 
price competition at this time.
     </p>
     <p>
      In comparison with the 1969 holiday season, the majority of 
retailers reported that they expect a heavier volume of sales this 
year. Three of the retailers expected a substantially heavier 
volume, eleven expected a slightly heavier volume, seven expected 
sales to be about the same as in the 1969 season, while only three 
felt sales might be slightly lighter this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the way of general comments, one retailer noted that consumer 
sentiment was low due to the economic situation but expected relief 
during the fourth quarter and early in 1971. One noted that if the 
General Motors strike continued, plus the massive layoffs at Texas 
Instruments, Ling-Temco-Vought, General Dynamics and Ford, that 
holiday sales could be softer than are now anticipated. One retailer 
indicated he was taking a "lean bull" position and expected October 
through April to be very strong for retail sales.
