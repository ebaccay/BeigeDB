      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business and labor leaders in the Ninth Federal Reserve District are 
very concerned about the persistence of inflationary pressures and 
seem to be willing to try almost anything, including wage-price 
guidelines, to control the problem. District investment firms are 
encountering financial difficulties and, as a result, have had to 
alter their operations. Businesses are continuing to cut back their 
investment plans, and scattered instances suggest that consumers may 
be changing their consumption patterns because of the uncertainty 
regarding the state of the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the go-around at the last meeting of the Board of Directors 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the directors were asked 
whether or not business and union leaders in their local areas would 
support some kind of incomes policy or wage-price guidelines. They 
felt that people are becoming increasingly concerned about inflation 
and are becoming progressively disenchanted with traditional 
restrictive monetary and fiscal policies. As a result, the directors 
felt that guidelines would probably be publicly unpopular but in 
many cases would be privately welcomed. In general, they thought 
that people would prefer to see voluntary controls imposed rather 
than new legislation, and that businessmen are more in favor of 
guidelines than labor leaders. The directors cited a number of
instances where business leaders have voiced approval of some kind 
of guidelines. The directors also cited cases where labor leaders 
did not want to be quoted but were concerned with the large 
settlements which have been won by unions in recent labor disputes. 
Because of these large settlements, rank and file members are 
expecting large wage increases and union leaders are afraid to ask 
for less. Guidelines would give them an excuse to argue for lower 
wage settlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      The financial difficulties being experienced by Wall Street 
investment bankers, mutual funds, and securities dealers are 
apparently also being encountered by Ninth District investment 
firms. A telephone poll of two leading local investment banking 
firms explored the implications of these problems in three areas of 
their operations. First, operating staffs of securities brokers have 
been cut back about 15 to 20 percent in the last year. These 
cutbacks, however, were attributed to the decline in volume of 
trading rather than to the current financial crisis. In general, 
sales staffs have been reduced, with the declines occurring in some 
instances through attrition rather than through layoffs. Second, a 
securities brokerage house is closing one of its suburban offices 
because of the lack of volume. In addition, a director was aware of 
a mutual fund in Billings, Montana, which has recently closed down. 
Third, merger activity among securities brokers appears to be on the 
upswing. Both investment bankers who were contacted reported that 
they had been approached by a number of smaller firms in the last 
three months. Although only two mergers have been consummated, these 
firms felt that additional mergers could take place in the not-too-distant future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Scattered pieces of information continue to show that District 
manufacturers are cutting back their capital expenditure plans. Two 
directors cited cases where distributors of heavy equipment to 
agriculture and construction firms have experienced sharp declines 
in sales during the past month or so. It was also reported that a 
large retail firm headquartered in the twin cities has cut back its 
capital appropriations by about 50 percent. One other director 
stated that General Motors has scheduled huge cutbacks in capital 
spending, with each division being asked to curtail capital 
expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of examples have come to light which suggest that consumers 
are changing their consumption patterns. A Minneapolis-based 
undergarment manufacturer reports that its sales are 10 to 15 
percent below last year's levels. They attribute their poor sales 
performance this year to the slowdown in department store sales and 
feel that consumers are taking their business to lower priced 
stores. Automobile dealers in the twin cities report a downturn in 
auto sales which has been centered primarily in higher priced 
automobiles and that sales of basic models are holding up fairly 
well. In addition, repair shops for both automobiles and other 
durable goods are experiencing sharp increases in business, which 
suggest that consumers are tending to hold off on major durables 
purchases. A telephone pol1 of resorts around the District reveals 
that resort owners are experiencing a number of cancellations, 
although accommodations at Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks 
are still very tight. All the resort owners who were contacted said 
that they could accept reservations for any time this summer.
