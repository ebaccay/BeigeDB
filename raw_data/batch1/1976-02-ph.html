      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Economic activity in the Third District has picked up in February. 
The manufacturing sector, which was just marking time in January, 
shows modest expansion this month and retailers report strong sales. 
Manufacturers in the region indicate that new orders are higher and 
inventory liquidation has been halted. At the same time, employment 
is about the same as in January and the workweek is fractionally 
longer. Prices in this sector are higher, but the reported increases 
are not as widespread as they were last month. The outlook in 
manufacturing for the next six months is for continued expansion. 
Area retailers are enjoying brisk sales and envision a healthy sales 
picture over the coming months. Bankers report that loan volume 
remains basically flat.
       </p>
       <p>
        District manufacturers, responding to this month's Business Outlook 
Survey, report a modest improvement in business over last month. Of 
the businessmen surveyed, 21 percent indicate improvement while 72 
percent report no change. New orders are up this month for the first 
time since November, and the level of inventories is unchanged for 
the first time since the fourth quarter of 1974. This steadiness in 
inventory levels is reported for both durables and nondurables. At 
the same time, jobs in manufacturing are holding steady, and the 
workweek is fractionally longer. Here, weaknesses in durables are 
offset by gains in nondurables.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is optimistic. 
More than 8 out of 10 executives polled expect a higher level of 
economic activity by August. A similar proportion anticipate an 
increase in new orders over the period and more than one-third 
project net accumulation of inventories. At the same time, these 
businessmen look for gains in employment. Close to half of the 
respondents expect to add to their work forces, and almost one-third 
plan to lengthen the average workweek. Increases in spending for 
plant and equipment are anticipated by 4 out of 10 respondents. This 
is a continuation of a gradual upward trend in planned capital 
expenditures which began last October.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail executives report that current sales are running well ahead 
of the same period last year. In addition, all of the merchants 
contacted indicate that present sales levels are above their 
expectations for this period. In general, the strength in sales at 
most stores is reported to be broad-based, but certain items are 
singled out as strong sellers. For example, one retailer notes a 
resurgence in lower-priced durables such as small electrical 
appliances priced under $50. He adds, however, that the bulk of the 
strength is in soft goods, especially apparel. In general, retailers 
in the area are optimistic about the next several months and there 
is little expectation that sales would suffer much if the proposals 
for substantial increases in Philadelphia taxes were enacted. One 
merchant indicates that a bullish forecast for his stores' sales 
made last November will probably be revised upward in the near 
future. In addition, all of the retailers contacted feel that 
inventories are better-balanced than they were during most of 1975.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the price front, manufacturers report that prices are up for 
goods they buy as well as for those they sell. However, the 
increases are not as widespread as they were in January. This month, 
for example, only one-third of the respondents are paying higher 
prices for their inputs while close to one-half were experiencing 
increases last month. Similarly, 19 percent of the executives polled 
in the latest survey indicate higher prices for the products they 
sellâ€”down from 36 percent in the previous month. The outlook for 
the longer term is for additional inflation. Nine out of ten 
respondents expect to be paying more for supplies six months from 
now, and almost 2 out of 3 anticipate higher prices for their 
finished products. Retailers in the area note that while prices of 
inputs and outputs are both higher, there is "continued moderation" 
in the rate of increase. One merchant expects a highly competitive 
retail environment in '76, and as such he feels that it will be 
difficult for retailers to raise gross margins by raising their 
prices faster than costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bankers in the District report that total loans outstanding are 
essentially flat. At one bank, however, loan volume is reported to 
be declining and below levels forecast in December 1975. There is 
general agreement that the weakness is in the business loan 
component. One executive notes that competition is much keener now 
than it was a few months ago. Last November an offer by his bank of 
90-day loans at below-prime rates elicited a strong response. A 
similar offer recently has not added one cent to the volume of loans 
outstanding. The majority of bankers contacted look for an expansion 
in loans to begin sometime in the second quarter with slightly over 
10 percent growth for the year being a frequently-mentioned 
expectation. The consensus is that consumer loans will grow faster 
than C&amp;I loans. None of the bankers contacted expects short-term 
interest rates to go any lower, but there's uncertainty as to when 
they'll begin to rise. There is agreement, however, that the climb 
will be gradual at least through this year. All of the bankers 
surveyed express concern over the recent "Problem List" disclosures, 
but no unmanageable problems from customers are reported. In 
general, area bankers feel that the proposed increase in local taxes 
in Philadelphia will have no noticeable impact on the current 
recovery. Any effects on the regional economy, they feel, will be 
longer-term.
