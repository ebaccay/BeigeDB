      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 19, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Our business directors reported business conditions as very strong. 
Improvements in machinery and aerospace orders were noted, while 
orders in the consumer durables area were variously termed as 
"steadily improving" to "fantastic." Some directors felt that the 
Price Commission's profit margin rules would begin to pinch profits 
in the second half of 1973, while others noted current problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       A raw material supplier to the tire industry noted that business was 
excellent, with record sales and orders in November. There is some 
apprehension, however, that retailers are overstocking tires so that 
the high level of manufacturers' sales now may be borrowing from 
future sales. A high orders backlog was noted by a manufacturer of 
superalloys who also reported that commercial aircraft engine orders 
were finally getting back to respectable levels. These are 
replacement engines for the 727 and 747 planes. A manufacturer of 
general aviation aircraft also noted strong orders. Machine tool 
orders were also reported as finally really turning up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors expected large increases in capital spending in 
1973. Two directors noted that in a number of lines, production had 
already reached capacity levels, although one director of a large 
conglomerate stated that most of his lines still had slack.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bank director whose bank does the payroll for a number of firms in 
the Boston SMSA reported no increase in employment in November from 
August levels, although payrolls rose 18 percent from the previous 
month's level. Obviously, firms are still relying heavily on 
overtime rather than new hiring.
      </p>
      <p>
       A New Hampshire banker reports a slowing in both savings and demand 
deposit growth. Apartment building remains strong, and the demand 
for mortgages almost exceeds the bank's ability to make the loans. 
Mortgage rates are up one-fourth percent, but other rates have been 
steady.
      </p>
      <p>
       All our directors were asked to comment on the effects of the Price 
Commission's profit margin guidelines. One director said that the 
recent change in the way of calculating costs (allowing the 
inclusion of interest on long-term debt and adjustments for divested 
companies) meant that the guidelines would not affect his firm in 
1973. Another director noted that the guidelines had caused some 
inequities. For example, a large consumer paper goods producer whose 
costs had risen substantially could not raise its prices because 
another large, diversified consumer goods producer, which also is a 
major supplier of consumer paper products, could not raise its 
prices because the latter company had hit its profit margin ceiling. 
Thus, the first company's profits were being squeezed. This director 
noted he is aware that this kind of problem is occurring in a number 
of firms. Two directors stated that they had recently raised prices 
in a number of lines and, therefore, did not expect any profit 
squeeze in the first half of 1973.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two of our academic correspondents this month, Professors Samuelson 
and Wallich, stressed that a "well-behaved, speedy" expansion has 
occurred with inventory accumulation still "held in reserve" and 
showing signs of coming to life. Professor Wallich felt the 
wholesale price figures confirm an increasing rate of inflation; the 
behavior of the deflator, he argued, was in part a statistical quirk 
due to devaluation. Preferring a more lengthy expansion to speed at 
this stage, Samuelson favored moving toward restraint. Specifically, 
he would like to see a gentle rise in the Federal funds rateâ€”130 
basis points over the next yearâ€”and would not be upset by a 4-percent rate of monetary growth even if it brought a substantially 
faster rise over the next month or two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professor Eckstein disagreed with this viewpoint, arguing that an 
increase in banks reserves at an annual rate of at least 6 percent 
is of critical importance. Unless the Federal Reserve accommodates 
the expansion that much, "all bets are off" on the prevailing 
handsome forecasts, as well as the hope of holding the bill rate 
under 5.55 percent and the AAA utility rate under 8.0 percent during 
1973. The only serious danger of excess in the current outlook is in 
housing, where rationality may be destroyed by the tax shelter 
feature in apartment building. The bottlenecks which have been 
experienced are mainly a by-product of the housing boom and are not 
surprising for this stage in an expansion. There is still no 
prospect of a general excess demand for labor. Eckstein was dubious 
about the projected amount of overwitholding refunds as well as the 
stimulative impact of the refunds on consumer spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       All three criticized attempts to hold interest rates down 
administratively. Eckstein felt it would lead to demands for more 
rigid interest rate controls and for capital allocation. Wallich 
argued it would result in serious distortions, in particular by 
forcing borrowing outside the banking system. This would be 
institutionally damaging and could weaken the Fed's ability to 
control the situation. He felt the political trade-off could be 
better achieved by an increase in the corporate income tax rate. To 
Samuelson, the key is to gain the cooperation of labor leaders who, 
he suspected, are more concerned with profits than with the prime 
rate. He did not feel there would be serious distortions in the 
short run but suggested the problem will not disappear after the 
spring round of labor negotiations since any restraint on the part 
of labor would probably be contingent on the continuation of profit-price controls.
