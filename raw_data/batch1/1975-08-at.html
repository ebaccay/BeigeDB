      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 13, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Sixth District have definitely moved into 
the recovery stage. Most businesses now report rehiring of workers 
laid off over the past year. Capital spending plans, curtailed 
during the recession, are now being taken off the shelves. 
Construction activity in single-family housing is showing definite 
signs of improving. There is concern over a shortage of skilled 
labor in specific occupations, and a natural gas shortage could 
cripple the District's important chemical industry.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       A pickup in new orders has stimulated rehiring by many District 
businesses. Genesco, in Nashville, Tennessee, reports a jump in new 
orders at the wholesale level. Other Tennessee manufacturing 
industries which are tied to construction have recently reported 
increased orders. Several wood products plants have reopened, after 
being closed for several months. The outlook for this industry, 
according to local businessmen, is good, and most plants are now at 
full production. In Alabama, new jobs and rehiring are proceeding 
more slowly, largely because of the lagging steel industry. One 
Alabama steel manufacturer closed an entire plant for the first week 
in July and still remains well below full operating capacity. 
However, a Goodyear tire plant in Gadsden, Alabama, has rehired most 
of its employees. The plant is now operating on a six-day week and 
expects to continue to operate at this rate through the summer. In 
Louisiana, the Uniroyal Tire Company, as well as several other local 
plants, is rehiring workers previously laid off. The Mobile, 
Alabama, area reports rehiring in the shipbuilding, paper, and 
chemical industries. Several employment agencies in the District 
indicate a turnaround in the past two months. A representative of 
Snelling and Snelling in Jacksonville, Florida, indicates that there 
has recently been in improvement in the "quality" of job orders they 
are receiving from local businessmen, as well as in the number of 
firms that are looking for people. This representative reports that 
their firm will begin advertising on television in August. Car 
dealers are also reportedly now anxious to restock their staffs of 
car dealers. But they are now looking for a new breed of car 
salesmen, college-educated men who want to make a career out of 
selling cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The two areas of greatest weakness—autos and housing—appear to be 
picking up. A regional Ford representative reports July sales in 
Georgia and Florida up sharply from June. The new high-fuel economy 
(MPG) models are given a good deal of credit for the pickup. Sales 
of imports and luxury cars, as well as used cars, are still the 
strongest. The high trade-in price of used cars may be stimulating 
some new car sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of a recovery in the single-family housing market became 
more evident. Inflows to District savings and loans association were 
strong throughout the first half of this year. This, along with the 
housing tax credit, has finally begun to stimulate sales and new 
construction. Single-family home sales in Florida are booming, 
according to one Florida banker. Throughout the state, even in south 
Florida, sales and new starts are moving ahead. The condominium glut 
remains a problem. Even condominium sales are beginning to show some 
strength in the Tampa-St. Petersburg area, but a tremendous glut 
still remains. The condominium glut is also a problem in Atlanta, 
Knoxville, and Nashville.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending plans are apparently being taken off the shelves 
and dusted off by several District industries. New contracts were 
also announced by several area companies. In the Mobile, Alabama, 
area, some of the large industrial developments and expansions 
shelved in late 1974 are now being put into action. One of the 
largest is the Ow Badische $100 million chemical plant. Union 
Carbide is planning to build a plant employing 750 workers in 
Columbus, Georgia. In Tennessee, pollution-control projects costing 
about $78.5 million were approved by the Tennessee Valley Authority. 
Most of the projects are for modifications of their twelve coal-fired steam power plants to meet state and Federal water-quality 
standards. The United States Air Force announced a $24.7 million C-130 Hercules contract for the Lockhead-Georgia Company, pushing the 
total C-130 contract announcements in July to more than $100 
million. This will stabilize employment at the huge aircraft 
manufacturer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most area businessmen appear to have calmed their fears of 
shortages, but some conflicting evidence was also noted. In Jackson, 
Mississippi, the supply of materials for manufacturers is not 
anticipated to be a problem, but energy costs and natural gas 
availability are much more of a concern. An east Tennessee chemical 
manufacturer also expressed concern over the shortage of natural 
gas. A furniture manufacturer reports a drastic change in supply and 
delivery recently. Several types of wood have recently been more 
difficult to obtain. He indicates that the problem stems from large 
orders for these woods placed by the Japanese. Upholstery fabric 
prices have also gone up. A representative of the Georgia Purchasing 
Managers Association reports that delivery lead times have increased 
from thirty days to between forty-five and sixty days in the last 
two months. Twenty-eight percent of the purchasing agents surveyed 
expected higher prices on materials purchased in the next three 
months. The Alabama Purchasing Managers Association characterizes 
most purchasing managers as "nervous" about the return of shortage 
conditions.
