      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      The gradual improvement in general economic activity continues in 
  the Seventh District. However, final sales of some items—e.g., 
  apparel, household appliances, and medium and heavy trucks—have not 
  matched expectations. Inventories are generally "in good shape," although on the low side in some cases. Fears that shortages would 
  develop late this year or early next year have diminished. Attitudes 
  of business executives and most consumers remain cautious, with an 
  eye either to possible shortfalls from forecasts, or possible 
  adverse political developments. Capital expenditures appear to be 
  gaining strength, overall, but very gradually. Credit is in good 
  supply in all sectors. There are some signs of revival in 
  nonresidential construction. Forecasts of interest rate increases 
  are more moderate as loan demand from both the business and consumer 
  sectors has been less than expected.
     </div>
     <p>
      Many business executives, who report demand for their products to be 
  far less robust than in 1973 and early 1974, emphasize that they 
  look back upon the chaotic multiple-ordering and gray markets of 
  that period with horror. Distortions, partly caused by price 
  controls, made accurate readings of the underlying strength of their 
  markets impossible. Businesses are attempting to keep tight control 
  on costs relating to capital expenditures, purchase commitments, and 
  use of labor. Some say that "the financial people are in control 
  today," rather than the sales people who made the big decisions in 
  the last boom.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lead times have lengthened further on average, despite margins of 
  unused capacity. Cancellation of the scheduled October 1 steel price 
  boost reflects buyer resistance and their reluctance to build 
  inventories. Except for a few items such as special castings, there 
  are no reports of current shortages. The 130-day tire strike, 
  apparently, did not affect vehicle output at all, but supplies of 
  snow tires may be tight this winter. Relatively easy supply 
  situations do not necessarily mean stable or declining prices. 
  Producers have raised prices of rubber products substantially, 
  although "quietly." In another example, paper prices are expected to 
  average 5 to 7 percent higher this year, followed by another 6 
  percent rise in 1977, despite ample capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large retailers indicate that sales were stronger in most 
  departments in August. Apparel and fashion goods sales continue 
  below forecasts, however. Retailers' inventories are judged to be 
  fairly well-balanced because of cautious ordering policies. Sales 
  are expected to rise further in the months ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of major appliances are below expectations with freezers far 
  below last years Sales of "built-ins" going to individual remodeling 
  projects as well as to new construction are quite strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers and other suppliers of consumer wants comment that luxury 
  products are in strongest demand, a phenomenon noted throughout the 
  recession. Airline travel measured by passenger miles has been about 
  10 percent above last year in recent months with all of the gain in 
  pleasure travel. Flights to Hawaii are virtually filled.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales of autos and other vehicles to consumers have continued at an 
  excellent pace. As many dealers exhausted their supplies of large 
  cars, sales of small cars, including imports, were stimulated. Some 
  small cars have been sold at cut-rate prices, especially certain 
  1975 models still on hand after two years. Inventories of new models 
  are less ample than a year ago and production is being pushed hard 
  with Saturday work typical. General Motors is anxious to "get a 
  reading" on public acceptance of its new lines of lighter, shorter 
"big cars." Chicago area sales will be watched as a bellwether for 
  the nation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Light truck sales have been at record levels for some months with a 
  large share going to consumers. Sales of medium (10,000 to 26,000 
  pounds), have remained slow. Sales of heavy trucks have increased, 
  but not as much as expected, and advanced production schedules may 
  have to be pared back. A producer of diesel engines is operating at 
  all-time high levels, and wonders if orders for truck engines will 
  be maintained, Meanwhile, sales of diesels for construction 
  equipment and industrial uses have not increased significantly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most producers of equipment report that demand has improved, but 
  very gradually and the picture is "spotty." In general, it is the 
"early movers"-smaller equipment and components such as controls and 
  smaller electric motors—that have showed the largest gains with the 
"laggers," including most types of heavy equipment, still slow. A 
  producer of heavy industrial cranes and large mining shovels reports 
  that order backlogs are eroding rapidly and production may be 
  reduced from current record levels in the months ahead. Machine tool 
  builders have been pleased with recent increases in orders and 
  expect substantial additional orders to be placed during or after 
  the 10-day biennial machine tool show now being held in Chicago 
  (September 10-17).
     </p>
     <p>
      Stocks of all types of petroleum products are ample. One forecast of 
  the rise in total sales this year has been reduced from 6 to 4.5 
  percent, mostly because vacation driving has been less than 
  anticipated. A "normal" winter or worse could mean some problems 
  with availability of fuel oil, and, also, further curtailments of 
  natural gas. OPEC nations are now expected to increase crude oil 
  prices by 15 percent at yearend, double the rise expected earlier, 
  mainly because of stronger than expected demand outside the U.S.
     </p>
     <p>
      Lead times on cold-rolled steel and galvanized sheets have been cut 
  by half since late spring. One forecast of steel shipments for 1976 
  has been reduced from 98 to 96 million tons because user inventories 
  are not being increased as expected, not because consumption is less 
  than expected. Local analysts point to a change in steel order 
  patterns with "reservation planning" by large users over a longer 
  horizon.
