      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 14, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Our January survey of Fifth District business conditions yielded 
mixed results. Manufacturers' responses indicate little or no change 
in their level of activity during December, while retailers were 
unanimous in reporting increased sales. Among manufacturing firms, 
shipments and new orders were essentially unchanged from the 
previous month while backlogs of orders were down somewhat. 
Inventories of both manufacturers and retailers showed little change 
in December. Inventories at retailers have apparently been brought 
into line with desired levels, while among manufacturers they remain 
in excess. Prices, including employee compensation, continued to 
rise across a broad front. The outlook for business during the next 
six months remains bright, as most respondents expect improvement 
over that time period. Our directors also noted improvement in the 
confidence of consumers as well as of businessmen in the District. 
Bank credit in the Fifth District advanced moderately in December, 
with a slight negative movement in loans offset by continued 
investment in United States Government securities. Gains were posted 
in both demand and time deposits, and purchases of large 
certificates of deposit (CDs) showed special strength. District 
farmers' cash receipts from marketings during January-October 1975 
recorded a 3 percent increase over a year earlier, compared with a 3 
percent decline nationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of manufacturers responding to our January survey, slightly over 30 
percent reported an increase in sales while almost as many reported 
a decrease. Among individual industries, the increases in shipments 
were concentrated in textile mill products, apparel, and lumber and 
wood products. Reductions occurred primarily in chemicals and 
machinery and equipment. Overall, the volume of new orders looked 
much the same as shipments, although manufacturers reporting 
declines slightly outnumbered those reporting increases. Industries 
showing increases in new orders include primary metals and apparel, 
while declines were noted in transportation equipment. Overall, 
machinery and equipment manufacturers showed some decline in new 
orders, but some firms in this industry reported gains. Backlogs of 
orders declined somewhat at District manufacturing concerns. 
Inventories were essentially unchanged, although materials seem to 
have declined slightly, while finished goods edged upward. One third 
of our respondents continue to view current inventory levels as 
excessive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Responses suggest a slight decline in manufacturing employment, the 
first since May. Hours worked per week held firm, while employee 
compensation—in terms of average hourly earnings—rose at nearly 
one third of the firms responding. Prices paid and received were 
also up across a broad range. Nearly one third of the manufacturers 
continue to view current plant and equipment as excessive, but 
nearly all are satisfied with current expansion plans.
       </p>
       <p>
        District retailers apparently had a very good Christmas season. One 
branch director called it "exceptional". All survey respondents 
reported increased sales in December; one called it the greatest 
change noted in a number of years. The improvement in total sales 
has not spread to big-ticket items, however. Retail inventories were 
unchanged from a month earlier and are now in line with desired 
levels. Retailers are generally optimistic about the near future, 
hoping that the recent surge in sales will carry over into 1976.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial and industrial loans at weekly reporting banks declined 
from November, primarily reflecting seasonal influences such as 
repayment of loans by retailers. Loans to durable goods 
manufacturers showed small but steady increases, but these were 
offset by declines in loans to nondurable goods manufacturers. 
Business loans in December were 7.7 percent below the year-ago 
level. Consumer loans recently have advanced at a very gradual rate, 
while real estate loans here declined. Total investments by weekly 
reporting banks posted strong gains in December, led by a surge in 
purchases of Treasury bills and longer maturity Treasury issues. 
Holdings of municipals fell slightly from November. Total 
investments in December were 19.5 percent above a year ago, while 
total assets posted a year-to-year gain of 3.3 percent. Steady gains 
in time deposits continued during December, and CDs increased by 3.5 
percent from the previous month. Demand deposits were 3.2 percent 
above the year-earlier level. Net purchases of Federal funds by 
member banks over the first four weeks of December dropped to their 
lowest level since January 1973. Discount window borrowings by 
member banks remained at the near zero level reached in November.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the agricultural sector, a buildup in the inventory of hogs held 
for breeding purposes and a sizable upturn in intended farrowings 
during the December 1975-May 1976 period strengthen prospects for 
larger pork supplies in the second half of 1976. Indications point 
to a somewhat larger increase in the Fifth District than in the 
nation.
