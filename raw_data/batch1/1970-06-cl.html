     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in this District appear to have stabilized at a 
depressed level. There is little evidence that a general upturn is 
in progress, although most of the strike-related distortion seems to 
have been eliminated. In retail stores consumers appear to have 
become more price conscious,
but softness of demand is selective 
rather than general. 
The mood of our directors has recently shifted 
from cautious optimism to deep pessimism. They now believe that the 
current economic contraction will be more prolonged and deeper than 
most economists and public policy makers are currently expecting.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent terminations of strikes in the trucking and rubber industries 
resulted in a peaking in mid-May in the sharp rise in the District's 
insured unemployment rate. The rate has subsequently declined 
moderately although it remains roughly three times as large as the 
low point of last autumn. Our regular monthly survey of District 
manufacturers conducted during the first two weeks of June revealed 
further distortions caused by strikes and lockouts. Some of the 
major 
metal-producing and metal-working firms expect to be shipping 
in June partly from inventories that they were unable to ship in 
May. The survey accordingly showed an anticipated rebound in 
shipments and in employment during June, coupled with a sharp 
decline in inventories. Other anticipatory data for the current
month do not suggest an immediate general recovery in the District's 
manufacturing sector.
     </p>
     <p>
      Discussion with an economist from a major department store chain 
doing nationwide business revealed that consumers have sharply 
curtailed their purchases of high-price luxury items and certain 
appliances. On the other hand, bargain basement business is 
extremely good for many items such as ready-made apparel. 
Confirmation of the fact that sales of big-ticket items 
(refrigerators, televisions, and other durable goods) have suffered 
came from one of our directors who is on the board of a major 
department store in Cleveland. Most of our directors, especially 
those associated with large industrial firms and banks, are now 
extremely pessimistic. They believe that real economic activity will 
show little, if any, recovery in the second half of 1970, and they 
are deeply concerned by their inability to counter labor's monopoly 
position in collective bargaining negotiations. A number of 
directors expressed reservations about the Administration's economic 
policies although most of them endorsed our current monetary policy 
of moderate growth in money and bank credit. There was a general 
feeling that senior executives in a broad range of industries shared 
this pessimism and were as a result lowering their sights for 
capital spending and employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      One director who was formerly quite optimistic emphasized concern 
about growing weakness in new orders in his industry: auto and 
aircraft components. Another director representing a very large 
office equipment manufacturing firm reported that many firms were 
limiting or reducing expenditures for computers and related 
equipment and that he expected further cutbacks over the months 
immediately ahead.
     </p>
     <p>
      The following comments were received about the machine tool 
industry, which is important in this District. A director who is the 
president of a substantial machine tool manufacturing firm mentioned 
that, although his competitors are experiencing a slowdown in new 
orders for machine tools, his company's business continues to be 
good. The chairman of a very large machine tool company 
headquartered in the District informed this Bank that, in contrast 
to poor domestic business, his company's plants in European 
countries are booking some 30 percent more orders than a year ago. 
An economist from another large machine tool company said he 
believed there was definite evidence that business has bottomed out 
in his firm, although he saw no signs of an upturn and did not 
expect one until after Labor Day. The same economist, who is highly 
regarded in the profession, volunteered the information that there 
is "across-the-board weakness" in his firm's prices. For example, 
prices of metal cutting machine tools, for which there are no 
official Bureau of Labor Statistics price data, are declining. 
Similar price reductions not reflected in the BLS data were reported 
by a director currently engaged in consulting work in the aluminum 
industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other comments of interest from the directors included mention of 
the fact that the supply situation in the coal industry is so tight 
that some utilities are currently importing coal at prices above 
domestic rates. A director from a large reserve city bank noted a 
recent sizable increase in business loans for current working 
capitalâ€”i.e., for "paying the bills". One director, the chairman of 
a large rubber company, reported a highly front-loaded labor 
compensation settlement for his firm. The contract calls for 
increases of 12 percent in the first year, 8 percent the second 
year, and 4 percent the third year.
