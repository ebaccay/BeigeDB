       The deterioration in District business conditions has become more 
pronounced during the past month. Retail sales are weak, inventories 
are high, and retailers are not optimistic with regard to near-term 
prospects. Manufacturing activity continues to decline, and 
weaknesses are becoming more widespread among industries. Layoffs 
have risen sharply, and a number of firms are reducing employment in 
December. Restoration of coal mining operations will help conditions 
in some areas, but is expected to dampen order demand in the steel 
industry. There are scattered signs that business loan demand has 
spurted recently as businesses are burdened with heavy receivables 
and excessive inventories. S&amp;Ls continue to show improvement in 
savings inflows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales for the holiday season appear to be off to a slow 
start, according to executives from three major retail concerns. 
Short-term prospects are generally considered to be pessimistic. 
Sales in the Cleveland area have been hindered in part by adverse 
weather and by a lack of advertising (the area's two daily 
newspapers have not been published for more than a month). 
Inventories are reported to be on the high side, especially for 
appliances, television sets, and home furnishings. Buying 
commitments have been cut back and the firms are attempting to 
promote sales through pro-Christmas markdowns. All concerns report 
that fewer part-time workers than usual have been hired for the 
holiday season, and some firms are allowing attrition to reduce 
full-time staffs. A manufacturer of men's clothing notes that their 
bookings from the retail sector for the spring of next year have 
fallen below those of last spring. Retailers have become more 
cautious in their ordering, and cancellations are increasing. The 
executive mentioned a softening in textile prices and a dramatic 
price weakening in the past few months in the secondary clothing 
market (goods canceled and sold at close-out prices).
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing agents in the Cleveland area report a further 
deterioration in business conditions. Production declined in 
November for the second consecutive month, while new orders declined 
for the third consecutive month. The problem of shortages has 
diminished considerably, and raw materials are becoming more readily 
available. Price increases continue to slow. Last month there was a 
significant reduction in buying lead time for capital equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our own monthly survey of District manufacturers reveals a 
progressive weakening in the new order picture during recent months, 
declining backlogs, a slowing in inventory accumulation and price 
increases, improvement in delivery time, and further reductions in 
employment and hours. Layoffs have been widespread among auto 
producers and suppliers, and in the appliance industry. In addition, 
the coal strike has disrupted economic conditions in those portions 
of the District heavily dependent on coal production. A number of 
machinery companies are planning to reduce employment in December. 
Other employment layoffs are planned this month by firms in 
printing, paper, housing materials, food processing, aluminum, oil 
refining, appliances, autos, tires, and auto supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three major machine tool companies in Cleveland are experiencing 
declines in new orders, but high levels of backlogs are expected to 
sustain strong shipments well into 1975, One firm reported that 
their new orders are just offsetting cancellations, and their 
backlogs (2-1/2 years) are being reduced. Another said cancellations 
for machine tools exceeded orders last month (cancellations totaled 
18, orders 12). The third company is beginning to reduce employment 
even though its backlogs are still rising; shortages of certain 
materials and parts continue to hamper optimum production in that 
firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel producers are still allocating steel, although three major 
steel companies report some increase in cancellations and declines 
in new orders. Autos, appliances, and some construction users have 
cut back orders. Steel that has been canceled has been promptly 
resold to oil and gas producers, railroads, mining, shipbuilding, 
pipe manufacturers, and other capital goods industries where demand 
remains strong. Several steel firms were forced to curtail 
operations because of the coal strike; they plan to step up 
production as soon as it is apparent that coal deliveries will be 
resumed. The steel companies also fully expect a wave of 
cancellations when coal miners return to work and the availability 
of steel returns to normal. Customer stocks are estimated to be 
about 10 per cent above normal, but mill stocks are abnormally low 
and will be rebuilt as customer demand slackens. Steel industry 
economists note that steel imports have soared recently and foreign 
steel prices have been cut dramatically to near parity with domestic 
prices. Accordingly, they expect the U. S. deficit in steel to 
increase in 1975 because imports will be higher and exports lower 
than in 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the financial side, several large banks in Cleveland noted a 
spurt in business loan demand in recent weeks. Customers are said to 
be heavy on receivables and inventories and in need of cash. One 
bank also reported that in recent months they have significantly 
scaled down the proportion of auto dealer loans accepted because of 
a deterioration in quality and lengthening in maturities. Thrift 
institutions continued to experience an improvement in net savings 
inflows in November. An official with a FHLB expressed the view that 
if gains in deposits continue, the S&amp;Ls will first pay their 
debts and rebuild liquidity before seeking mortgage loans more 
aggressively. An executive for a $150 million S&amp;L noted that their 
net gain in deposits during November-December has about equalized 
losses during the summer months. They recently lowered their 
variable rate mortgage to 9.6 per cent.
