      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <p>
       Retail sales at department stores in the Tenth District continue to 
hold up, although managers are still more unsure than usual about 
the months ahead. Disaffection with the big car is reemphasized by 
the extension of the closedown of Kansas City's Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac assembly plant. Power boat dealers, too, are feeling the 
energy crunch. Farm income is suffering a setback with the recent 
decline in farm prices, especially the prices of livestock. The 
consumer is beginning to benefit as meat prices come down, but a 
reduced supply of feed cattle in the months ahead may soon reverse 
this downturn. Business loan demand has been unseasonally strong, 
and deposits have increased apace. Oil companies are among those 
businesses largely responsible for the rising demand for loans, 
while deposit growth is largely in consumer time deposits and large
certificates of deposit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store executives in metropolitan areas throughout the 
District report that, while business is not booming, sales do show 
strength. In most stores contacted, sales are up more than prices 
over last year. Several managers emphasized that it is still too 
early to gauge sales trends. They are looking to Easter sales as the 
first solid indicator of the consumers' buying mood. For those who 
would make one, the current best guess as to the outlook for 
department stores is for rising volume in the upcoming months, 
assuming gasoline supplies remain adequate to support shopping. 
Contrary to fears some months ago, inventory levels have been 
relatively easy to maintain, and currently are considered adequate 
for spring. Most managers note no significant change in the 
departmental mix of their sales, although sales of television sets 
and stereos are "outstanding" at one store, and a luxury retailer is 
enjoying extremely strong demand for silver and fine jewelry. Some 
declining interest in department store lines of outdoor recreation 
and leisure goods is observable, although the season still is young.
      </p>
      <p>
       Boat dealers already are convinced that they will suffer in 1974. 
One describes sales so far as "terrible". With the exception of big 
luxury cruisers, power boats are not selling well at all. A major 
distributor of boats in the District says that bank refusals to 
finance the inventories of boat retailers last fall has further 
depressed sales by limiting stocks. Consumer concern about the 
gasoline shortage is substantiated by the increasing popularity of 
canoes and sailboats. Another facet of spending patterns is 
indicated by rising sales of alcoholic beverages reported by two 
major retail chains in the Kansas City area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following a 1 1/2 percent gain during the month ended February 15, 
farm prices have since experienced a sharp reversal, especially for 
livestock. Beef prices are down almost 20 percent from their 
February level, and hog prices have also fallen somewhat. Although 
meat supplies have risen, reflecting the settlement of the truckers' 
strike and the shipment of heavier animals, prices at the farm level 
have slipped more than anticipated. One reason rests with consumer 
demand, which has remained quite sluggish as food merchants have 
widened their profit margins rather than pass on savings to 
consumers. Moreover, given the current plight of the cattle 
industry, producers have been sending more cows and bulls to 
slaughter, which tends to depress prices because the meat is of 
lower quality. Very recently, however, retail meat prices have begun 
to reflect developments at the farm level. Several Kansas City 
merchants reported that they have lowered beef prices and are now 
beginning to feature sales and engage in more advertising. 
Generally, most of them expect some further price moderation over 
the next few weeks. However, if feed cattle marketings decline in 
the second quarter as expected, any downturn in retail beef prices 
is likely to be short-lived.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviews with larger Tenth District member banks indicate that 
business loan demand has been unseasonally strong in recent weeks. 
Most banks report heavy borrowings by both national and local firms, 
although a few banks have experienced some softening in borrowing by 
national firms, which are felt to be switching to the commercial 
paper market. Even though shortages of pipe are reported to have 
limited operations of oil and oil-related businesses, banks in Tulsa 
and Oklahoma City continue to experience especially strong loan 
demand by these firms. Deposit inflows have generally been 
sufficient to satisfy loan demand. In some cases, several banks have 
found themselves with a surplus of loanable funds and have begun to 
increase their holdings of state and local securities, after having 
permitted them to run down for a period of time. One source of the 
deposit strength has been in consumer-type time deposits, inflows of 
which have been attributed to the drop in Treasury bill rates that 
occurred in late January and February. Certificates of deposit have 
also increased in recent weeks, as several banks are continuing to 
rely on this instrument to augment their supply of loanable funds.
