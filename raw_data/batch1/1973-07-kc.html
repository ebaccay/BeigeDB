      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

       July 11, 1973
      </strong>

      <p>
       Difficulties in obtaining fuel because of station closings 
apparently are scaring some motoring tourists away from the Tenth 
District this summer. But while the energy crisis may be depressing 
tourism, it is generating activity in the extractive industries in 
Wyoming and elsewhere. A survey of many light manufacturers 
throughout the District turned up none pessimistic about sales 
outlooks. Good news of a bumper crop of wheat in Kansas is largely 
offset by the bad news of the adverse effects of the price freeze on 
food supplies. Bankers feel that recent increases in administered 
interest rates (discount, prime) will have little dampening 
influence on economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       In most cases, popular historical sites and outdoor recreation areas 
throughout the District are attracting fewer tourists. Attendance at 
Eisenhower Center in Abilene, Kansas, for example, is running 20 
percent below last year. Colorado apparently has been hit hardest. 
Park and museum visitations there are down "tremendously." Even 
campground use has declined for the first time, while motel receipts 
are off as much as 30 percent in some Colorado areas, and perhaps 10 
percent statewide. Businessmen blame problems in obtaining gasoline. 
New Mexico also is suffering a decline in tourist business, with 
national park and monument visitation down 7 percent and state park 
visitation down 4 percent through May. Tourist inquiries received by 
the New Mexico Department of Development during June of this year 
were 25 percent fewer than those received during June of 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wyoming tourism so far this year appears about as good as last year, 
and perhaps somewhat better. But respondents fear that the early 
visitors are trying to beat the gasoline shortage, and that the 
season will finish slow. Advanced sales of nonresident hunting and 
fishing licenses are down 30 percent, no doubt partly due to their 
increased prices, but probably also due to fears of short gasoline 
supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks largely to fuel shortages, mining activity has increased 
greatly in the Tenth District western states. The shift toward 
atomic energy is stimulating the pace of extraction and processing 
of uranium in the Rocky Mountain States, where much of the nation's 
known reserves of uranium ore are located. On top of this, the 
renewed importance of coal has given a boost to the Wyoming economy, 
where major reserves of low sulfur coal are found in thick seams 
near the surface. In most of the District states, petroleum and 
natural gas production is of continuing economic importance. Stepped 
up efforts of discovering new fields and producing zones, and the 
possible economic feasibility of extracting oil from vast shale 
deposits, further brighten the economic outlook in the District.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales managers of many light manufacturing firms in the District see 
little indication of an end to the boom. They expect continued sales 
growth into 1974. Most firms are producing at or near capacity. 
Several are adding, or planning to add, to capacity. Only minor 
inconveniences are being experienced because of the price freeze. 
However, one Wyoming manufacturer came near closing recently because 
of inability to get diesel fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the month ended June 15, farm prices posted another gain, rising 
6 percent above May on the strength of higher grain prices. The 
spurt in grain prices was precipitated in large measure by a wave of 
buy orders from abroad in anticipation of export control. Despite 
record high prices, the freeze has locked much of the livestock 
industry into an unprofitable position, and with controls on 
exports, crop producers may curb their plans to expand output in the 
future. Food processors have also been hard hit by the new program 
as several have either cut back or closed down operations. On the 
whole, the stiff actions taken to ease food prices likely will prove 
counter productive and result in more restrictive production.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvest of the 1973 winter wheat crop is progressing rapidly. 
Earlier fears about possible shortages of combines, fuel, and 
elevator storage have been largely unfounded. Isolated shortages 
occur nearly every year, but usually are not so well publicized. If 
anything, the Kansas harvest has been less troublesome than usual. 
Some wheat is being stored on the ground, but none has been lost due 
to an inability to get it out of the field. At this point, the 1973 
crop could quite possibly exceed the June 1 estimates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Following the lead of the nation's largest banks, all but one of the 
major District banks increased their large borrower prime rates to 8 
percent in the past week. The only exception, a large Tulsa bank, 
raised its prime rate to 8 1/4 percent. Surveyed banks generally 
felt that further increases in the prime rate would be required to 
slow business loan demand. With regard to the prime rate charged to 
small borrowers, only two banks reported increases since the 
guidelines went into effect. However, the level of this rate varied 
greatly among banks, ranging from 6 1/2 to 8 1/2 percent. Recent 
increases in the discount rate were not viewed as being much of a 
deterrent to further borrowing from the Federal Reserve. Several 
banks implied that unless otherwise restricted they would continue 
to use the discount window as long as it remained their cheapest 
source of funds. Two banks also said that the recent increases in 
required reserve ratios would be far more effective in restraining 
their lending activities.
