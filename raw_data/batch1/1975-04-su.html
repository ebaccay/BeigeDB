      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      This month, reports from the twelve District Banks show faint signs 
  of optimism—not that the recession has already bottomed out, but 
  that it is approaching bottom. The unemployment picture is grim, and 
  there is no quick solution in sight. But inflation is abating. 
  Retail sales are weak, and the manufacturing picture is mixed, but 
  the inventory correction which must precede recovery is occurring. 
  While construction activity is very soft, mortgage rates are 
  dropping and the new tax bill provides some additional incentive to 
  get housing going again. Agriculture is likely to be a very strong 
  sector in the months ahead. Bank loan activity is weak throughout 
  the country, but savings inflows should provide the industry with 
  large amounts of lendable funds once the recovery starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      The picture in manufacturing is a mixture of good and bad. Post- 
  rebate auto sales have been soft for all except luxury and imported 
  car lines. However, some progress is reported in trimming auto 
  inventories and auto manufacturers are starting to produce some 
  models again. In contrast, both Chicago and Cleveland report that 
  steel production has been strong. Demand has recently begun to 
  slacken, but in the Cleveland District, the industry is still 
  producing to rebuild its own inventories. Kansas City reports that 
  its area's extractive industries are quite busy. Dallas, however, 
  notes that oil refining is now operating well below capacity as a 
  result of declining demand for oil and a shortage of available 
  storage capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is a consensus that the inventory adjustment process is moving 
  along well. In manufacturing, San Francisco reports that the firms 
  in its area are over the worst of their cutbacks, while Richmond 
  notes that the process may continue for another 3-6 months in its 
  District. But whether it be 3 months or 6 months, the message from 
  all areas of the country is that progress has been significant and 
  that production consistent with current demand is likely to begin 
  soon. In the retail sector the signals are less uniform. In general, 
  there have been substantial inventory reductions, but in some lines 
  of goods more trimming will be required. Consumer durables is one 
  example offered by Cleveland as an area which still has substantial 
  inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether retail sales will rebound enough to move these durables in 
  the near future is uncertain. Retail sales in March were weak in 
  most areas of the country. An early Easter, cold weather, and in 
  Philadelphia a major transit strike all combined to keep sales down. 
  Yet many Districts report that their retailers see signs of rising 
  consumer sentiment which make them cautiously optimistic about the 
  future.
     </p>
     <p>
      There are also hopeful signs in other sectors of the economy. 
  Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco all report strength in their 
  agricultural areas—despite the declining prices of farm products. 
  Residential and nonresidential construction are both still weak, but 
  the signs are hopeful. Unsold inventories of structures are said to 
  be manageable everywhere except in the Southeast and Far West. 
  Atlanta and San Francisco both report that builders in their region 
  are pessimistic about the chances for a quick recovery even with the 
  new Federal tax incentives. Elsewhere, it is expected that 
  construction can be a positive force in turning the economy around 
  in the months ahead. Oddly enough, tourism and leisure seem to be 
  one of the economy's strongest sectors. Cleveland, Atlanta, Kansas 
  City, and Minnesota all mention that industries catering to the 
  nation's taste for recreation have been remarkably resistant to the 
  recession. Capital expenditure plans of industry have been much less 
  buoyant. While the process of cutting capital spending may be 
  stabilizing, the outlook everywhere is, as Boston phrased it, 
"lean."
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial institutions throughout the country are facing the same 
  basic problem. Money is flowing into these intermediaries at a 
  record rate, but reinvestment alternatives are limited. By default, 
  the funds are being used to build liquidity because loan demand is 
  very weak. Virtually every District reports declining commercial and 
  retail loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inflation and unemployment also conform to the "good news/bad news" theme of these reports. There is widespread optimism that inflation 
  is being brought under control. Many examples of growing industrial 
  competition and price cutting are cited in the District reports. 
  There are also scattered reports of restraint in the prices of new 
  lines of seasonal consumer goods. Relatively few shortages still 
  remain. Kansas City forecasts that declining raw agricultural prices 
  may enable food prices to stabilize in the second half of 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      The news on unemployment is less cheerful. The best that any 
  District Bank could say is that the situation is no worse. 
  Unemployment in most areas is still rising. It is especially severe 
  in New England, but even some urban areas of the Midwest are feeling 
  the pinch. Scattered reports of rehirings and fewer layoffs create 
  an impression that, at best, the indices may soon stabilize at their 
  current high levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, however, the central theme of the reports is one of hope—hope that inflation is slowing, that the inventory correction is 
  nearing completion, and that lower interest rates may stimulate 
  housing and business investment. There is also a suggestion that the 
"hope" itself is very important. While the reports relay skepticism 
  that recent tax legislation will have any significant economic 
  impact on the economy, there is some agreement that the 
  psychological effect of fiscal stimulation on consumer and business 
  confidence may be very important in turning the economy around.
