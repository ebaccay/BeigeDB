      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 21, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The opinions expressed recently by Second District Federal Reserve 
Bank directors seemed to reflect some renewed doubts regarding the 
strength of the economic recovery. 
The directors in general foresaw 
no near-term improvement in the unemployment picture—indeed a few 
expected further weakening—and some felt that additional disruptive 
strikes were in the offing. On the other hand, the outlook for 
consumer spending and residential construction remains good; no 
significant changes in the trends in these sectors were thought to 
have occurred in the recent past. Most of the directors felt that a 
widespread lack of confidence among both businessmen and consumers 
is a major factor in the disappointingly slow rate of economic 
recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Concerning the unemployment situation, the directors felt the 
continuing efforts of businessmen to cut back costs made it unlikely 
that a significant reduction of unemployment would be achieved in 
the coming months. The chairman of the board of a large New York 
City bank said he expected that his firm would have a smaller staff 
at the end of 1971 than it had earlier in the year, and felt that 
other financial institutions-the city's strongest employers—also 
would not contribute much support for the local job market this 
year. The president of a nationwide manufacturer of plumbing and 
related products felt that the wage-cost squeeze was forcing 
industry to cut back on spending and employment. The Buffalo Branch 
directors agreed that labor markets in their locality generally 
continue to experience an oversupply of persons seeking a limited 
number of job openings, and said the permanent closing of some 
plants has aggravated the situation. Several directors also referred 
to the fiscal difficulties of state and local governments as a 
factor inhibiting hiring by these bodies. One exception noted by an 
upstate manufacturer was that employment in the automotive parts 
industry has been holding up well.
     </p>
     <p>
      This rather dim unemployment picture, to some extent, conditioned 
the directors' views with respect to potential labor strikes. Most 
directors agreed that further strikes could be expected, since labor 
leaders felt obliged to attempt to gain at least the same benefits 
for their members that other unions have received in the recent 
past. This view was most forcefully advanced by the chairman of the 
board of the large New York City bank and by the president of the 
plumbing concern. Upstate directors, on the other hand, tended to 
see a reduction in labor disputes. Some of the Buffalo directors, 
for example, felt that there would. be no steel strike because steel 
workers were becoming aware of both the worsening competitive 
position of U. S. steel in world markets and the fact that strike-hedge inventory-building by steel users would minimize the potential 
harm of a strike to the steel companies. Moreover, the other Buffalo 
directors who did believe a strike was in the offing thought it 
would be a short one. All of the Buffalo directors felt that the 
settlement would be somewhat less generous than that obtained in 
recent other major industrial wage agreements, although most felt 
that the settlement could not depart significantly from those 
recently negotiated in the aluminum and can industries.
     </p>
     <p>
      There seemed to be little change in recent weeks in the directors' 
assessments of the outlook for consumer spending and residential 
construction. Outlays for consumer goods were generally reported to 
be running at a level well ahead of last year, but have not as yet 
reached "boom" proportions. In regard to residential construction, 
the directors generally felt that activity in this sector was 
running at a satisfactory level, or would do so soon. The chairman 
of the board of a large Rochester department store noted that 
political problems "sometimes interfere with low- and middle-income 
housing." The president of an upstate bank felt. that home-building 
activity in his area was strong, but would be stronger except for 
the resistance of local officials to large projects, and the lack of 
adequate sewage, highway, and school facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the Second District directors stressed the lack of 
confidence among both business and consumers as a major factor 
inhibiting the economic recovery. This feeling was perhaps most 
forthrightly expressed by the vice president of Rochester's largest 
firm, who said: "businessmen and consumers had lost confidence in 
the Government's ability to design and execute programs which would 
lead the economy back to health along with a reduction in the rate 
of inflation." He attributed this feeling in part to a "lack of 
credibility in the economic statistics and forecasts developed by 
the Federal Government." Another upstate director described the 
situation as a "nationwide stagnation of enthusiasm."
