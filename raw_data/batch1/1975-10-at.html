      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales, hampered by adverse weather associated with Hurricane 
Eloise, made slow improvement. Signs of renewed single-family 
residential construction activity appeared in some areas, while 
nonresidential and multi-family residential construction remained 
largely dormant. A potential for renewed inventory adjustments 
continues to exist. Layoffs and wage disputes created crosscurrents 
in labor markets. Coal has stimulated business activity in the 
district.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The impact of Hurricane Eloise on the regional economy has been 
considerable. Substantial wind and water damage to tourist 
accommodations occurred in coastal Florida. Foul weather diminished 
tourist traffic and limited the growth of retail sales, particularly 
in coastal areas. Substantial damage to corn and peanut crops, pecan 
groves, farm buildings, and homes occurred in rural Alabama. Mid-Louisiana reports a disappointing soybean crop because of heavy 
rains; however, the sugar cane crop is reportedly the largest ever. 
Excessive moisture has also hampered corn and soybean yields in 
Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the hurricane's effects, directors report slow improvement 
in retail sales in many areas. However, sales in many localities 
remain below 1974 levels. Scattered reports are received of renewed 
reluctance to buy. The strongest recovery in sales appears to be in 
Tennessee, where gains in relation to 1974 levels are indicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The torpor of the construction industry continues, except for 
scattered reports from directors and lenders of renewed activity in 
the single-family residential sector, particularly in the state of 
Tennessee. A scarcity of mortgage funds is a recurrent theme in 
assessments of construction activity. Concerning the nonresidential 
sector, the latest survey of office space in Atlanta finds a vacancy 
rate of 20 percent, with continuing increases in store as additional 
structures are completed. Excessive stocks of commercial, office, 
and warehouse space are noted in reports from Florida. In Louisiana 
and Mississippi improvement is noted in building permits granted, 
but much of this activity is governmental. Large electrical 
generating plant construction projects are reported in both
Louisiana and Alabama. The multifamily residential market remains 
depressed, with sales of condominiums during August in the Miami 
area 69 percent below the 1974 level. In Jacksonville, although 
condominium sales were the best this year, only 4.3 percent of the 
1,500 units in inventory was sold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two reports emphasize a continuing potential for renewed inventory 
reductions, should demand fail to increase as expected. Customers of 
an iron foundry, thinking that their inventory adjustments were 
complete, had increased their orders. Now sales of fabricated metal 
products have failed to meet expectations, and a hold has been 
placed on foundry shipments scheduled for late September. In 
addition, although a large retailer notes lengthening delivery times 
and short supplies of piece goods, he states that insufficient 
increases of demand could cause a stock liquidation similar to that 
in 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       A membership survey by a purchasing managers association in Georgia 
found the following trends: lead times are lengthening on goods 
ordered; higher prices are reported by 40 percent, as in the 
previous month; 55 percent report prices unchanged; three-quarters 
anticipated higher prices over the next three months, compared to 
two-thirds in the previous month; reductions in inventories are 
indicated by about one-third and unchanged stocks by about 60 
percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       District labor markets were buffeted by strikes and layoffs but 
benefited from rehiring in certain industries. The strike by flight 
attendants against National Airlines, which began September 1, still 
continues. The central issue is comparability of wages with those of 
other carriers. Proposals for a five-year, no strike agreement are 
being considered by seven unions which represent National Airlines 
employees. An indefinite layoff of 500 workers, in addition to the 
750 furloughed in March, began October 6 at the Ford Motor Company 
assembly plant near Atlanta. These additional layoffs during a 
period of the year in which production is usually high are explained 
by weak demand for the intermediate-sized models manufactured at the 
plant. Near Birmingham, a lack of orders for steel has caused the 
shutdown of a U.S. Steel Corporation plant which employs 700 to 800 
workers. A Georgia chemical manufacturer has recalled 600 workers 
after a shutdown which lasted for six months, following settlement 
of a dispute concerning terms for extending a labor contract. A 
Florida iron foundry has recalled its second shift for molding of 
heavy castings. These employees were laid off in April. In Tennessee 
300 workers have been recalled by a manufacturer of baseboard 
electric heaters and electric can openers. An additional 200 
employees are expected to be recalled within four to six weeks when 
production of portable electric fans resumes. In Alabama depletion 
of the state's unemployment compensation pension funds has 
necessitated a deduction, beginning October 1, of one-half of 1 
percent from workers' paychecks in order to fund unemployment 
compensation payments. This is the first time in the history of the 
state program that such contributions have been necessary. Borrowing 
from the federal government will also supplement the fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coal is creating significant business activity in the district. Two 
deep shaft coal mines are to be sunk near Birmingham at a cost of 
about $50 million each. Production is expected to begin in 1978. 
Coal will be furnished under a long-term contract to six Japanese 
steel companies. In Mobile, Alabama, the prospective increase in 
coal exports has resulted in an effort to expand port facilities to 
accommodate increased shipments of coal. Construction of additional 
coal-powered electrical generating plants has led to an announcement 
by Southern Railway of plans to build facilities for coal loading, 
storage, and blending at an Alabama location. Following its 
completion in 1977, this plant will receive coal from barges on the 
Mississippi River and then distribute it to trains for 
transportation to generating plants.
