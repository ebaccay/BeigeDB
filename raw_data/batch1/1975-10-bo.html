      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors of the First District are more unsettled this month. 
They are aware that the economy may not trace out a classic 
recovery; ''to look around and see the wreckage, it is hard to feel 
cheerful." Many more problems, many more hazards seem to be plaguing 
business. There are suspicions that "our system doesn't work right." 
New England unemployment in August increased to 12 percent from 11.1 
percent for July. Rhode Island's figure improved substantially, 
dropping to 13 percent, but significant deterioration in 
Massachusetts (13 percent) and Connecticut (11.4 percent) more than 
compensated.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Banking directors report sluggish or declining asset portfolios. All 
components of loan demand continue weak, and consumer credit has 
shown only feeble activity. Inventory liquidation seems to be 
reaching a nadir, but firms which are in positions to restock are 
proceeding extremely cautiously. Consequently, banks are improving 
their money market positions, unwinding liabilities and buying 
Treasuries. The lack of profits continues to restrict municipals 
investments to local issues, at best. New York City evokes divided 
attitudes, but none of the directors is intimately involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The banking directors expect short-term interest rates to remain 
flat for a few months. There is hope that recent money stock data 
may occasion a fall in the federal funds rate. "It would be 
regrettable if short-term rates rose."
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales in the district have yet to recover convincingly. Most 
markets have seen only feeble increases in volume since April. One 
more successful retailing director reports a softening in activity 
for the last three weeks. He is stocking cautiously for Christmas, 
and business uncertainties are moderating his optimism for spring. 
In general, retail outlets have not begun restocking inventories. 
There seem to be few reported ripples from Grant. Although suppliers 
may have been caught, it was no surprise to our retail director. The 
firm had lost identity in a highly competitive market.
      </p>
      <p>
       A director from Connecticut has become more optimistic about his 
state's prospects for 1977-78. Foreign companies anxious to locate 
in the U.S. have been impressed with Connecticut. Also, corporate 
headquarters of U.S. firms have been moving to the state. Defense 
contracting is continuing strong as well. Other New England states 
cannot look forward to these sources of growth at this time, and 
concern about long-term development is becoming substantial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital goods producers and manufacturers of intermediate goods are 
still working off backlogs. So far there has been little stimulus 
for the First District in these industries. One director has 
identified a "key factor syndrome." Business is paying close 
attention to interest rates: rising rates are depressing, a fall is 
encouraging. There are reports that the war against inflation is 
misplaced if it requires high interest rates. With sluggish business 
and sales uncertainty, current rates are very high in both nominal 
and real terms. Lower rates would be necessary to bring out 
investment, expand capacity, and nourish the recovery, according to 
this view. Financial markets are much more than a veil over the real 
economy, and business is not poised to spring or encouraged to do so 
by high interest rates, a director reports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professors Houthakker, Solow, and Tobin were available for comment 
this month. Houthakker is still comfortable with general 
developments, while Solow and Tobin are very concerned about the 
propriety of policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Houthakker feels that the economy and policy are on the right track. 
He feels that a very vigorous rate of growth will prevail for a few 
months driven by exports, consumers, and an end to inventory 
liquidation; he then looks forward to growth of about 7 percent by 
the end of 1976 as business investment assumes a positive role. 
Inflation will slow to 4 percent at that time. He cautions against 
rapid money growth, and hopes that policy will favor the low end of 
the 5 to 7-1/2 percent range. He fears that the considerable money 
expansion in Europe should be discouraged, perhaps through official 
discussions: such European policy will present some danger that the 
dollar will become unduly strong, or that domestic monetary policy 
may be unfavorably undermined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solow is not impressed with Ford's proposed fiscal program, but he 
also believes the Fed need not be too concerned since there is 
little chance of enactment. He expects rates of growth of 8 to 10 
percent for the near future which is not out of line with a natural 
reboundâ€”especially given the foregoing collapse. Such rates of 
growth need not imply that a sustaining drive for recovery has 
surfaced, so he remarks that the Fed need not feel tempted to lean 
against the wind. He notes that most optimistic forecasters have 
assumed money growth in excess of 7-1/2 percent. Policy is not doing 
its part: "I have seen no calculation of cyclical increases in 
velocity that would make 7 to 7-1/2 percent money growth appropriate 
in this economic situation. It is an empty belief that this time 
will be different."
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobin emphasizes that velocity increase is related to money growth. 
Low money growth and high interest rates tend to cause a more 
sluggish expansion of GNP (or even a stalling of growth) which 
yields slow velocity expansion, at best. Tobin also stresses that 
high long-term interest rates reflect market expectations of rising 
future rates of interest, coupled with risk. There is a positive 
relationship between inflation and interest rates because the market 
has learned that price increases entail tight policy. The Fed should 
permit money growth to exceed 8-1/2 percent and explain that such a 
policy does not include a compensating stringency in the future. A 
temporary increase in money growth is appropriate for recovery; in 
fact, a recovery without big U.S. budget deficits requires this 
policy.
