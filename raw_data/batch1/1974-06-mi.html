      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

      <strong>
       June 12, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       According to directors' responses, the combination of scarce 
mortgage funds and high interest rates has seriously curbed District 
home building; the directors do not believe recent government 
efforts to stimulate this industry will significantly benefit the 
District. So far, high interest rates have not reduced loan demand 
at District commercial banks, and retail sales have been quite 
strong. Several directors expect business to remain good this 
summer, but others are less optimistic. District automobile sales 
have held up quite well, and the outlook for this summer's tourist 
business is quite optimistic. Directors indicated that it's still 
difficult to get farm machinery, but demand may ease later this year 
or in 1975. Our latest quarterly industrial expectations survey 
indicates that District manufacturing activity should expand through 
the rest of 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors commented that recent increases in interest rates and a 
lack of mortgage funds have slowed District home building. A Montana 
director said that his area's home building had come to a "grinding 
halt," and a Minneapolis-St. Paul area banker indicated that there 
are signs of accelerating weakness in the home building industry. 
Three directors reported no shortage of mortgage funds, but one of 
them felt that lenders were being more selective in granting home 
loans. The directors stated that the recent $10.3-billion Federal 
program to bolster the housing industry would not significantly 
affect the District. Despite weaknesses cited in residential 
construction, directors thought that total construction activity 
would remain strong, with increases in industrial and commercial 
construction, as well as heavy construction, offsetting declines in 
residential construction. In Montana, however, strikes have 
currently stopped construction activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors noted that high interest rates have not deterred 
District businessmen from borrowing and that loan demand is strong 
at District banks. For example, loan officers at a major 
Minneapolis-St. Paul area bank foresee no slowdown in loan demand in 
the near future. One director, however, indicated that businessmen 
are becoming very sensitive to the cost of working capital. 
Furthermore, some small and marginal businesses are having 
difficulty in obtaining funds, and some businessmen may have to 
forego new projects. Some directors suspected that their area banks 
may be encountering difficulty in accommodating current loan demand. 
In one area, District businesses are straining to obtain funds and 
are leaning on their customers to pay their bills; in another, 
businessmen have encountered difficulties in collecting accounts 
receivable.
      </p>
      <p>
       District retailers have enjoyed a good year so far, and several 
directors expect business to remain quite good. A director 
associated with the retail trade industry said that his business, 
which has been strong all year, has even improved recently. But a 
Twin Cities area banker looked for slack in consumer spending during 
the last half of 1974. He also mentioned that although retail 
spending has been relatively better in Minneapolis-St. Paul than in 
the nation, the unit volume of goods sold in the Twin Cities has 
changed very little from a year ago. Reinforcing this observation, 
one director reported a moderation in retail sales growth in his 
area and indicated that businessmen are not as optimistic as they 
were two to three months ago. Furthermore, a southern Minnesota 
director indicated that concern over recent agricultural price 
declines may dampen consumer spending in his area this summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobiles have been selling somewhat faster in the District than 
in the nation in recent months; however, May sales in the 
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area were down markedly. Declines 
were attributed to consumer resistance to higher car prices. 
Conversely, consumer interest in recreational vehicles has been 
renewed. The outlook for the District's tourist business this summer 
is generally quite optimistic. However, a director in the upper 
peninsula of Michigan indicated that concern with the availability 
of gasoline has clouded the outlook for tourism in his area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, the directors felt it was hard to get farm machinery in 
the District and, since many dealers have large order backlogs, the 
situation probably would not improve this year. However, the demand 
may be overstated if farmers are ordering equipment from more than 
one dealer. Also, the prospects of lower agricultural prices and 
farm incomes this year may reduce the demand for farm machinery in 
1975. A director from western South Dakota said that because of a 
lack of moisture and concern over agricultural prices, the major 
implement dealer in his area expects business may be off as much as 
33 percent from last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our second quarter industrial expectations survey shows continued 
expansion in District manufacturing activity. After rising 12.7 
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, District 
manufacturing sales are expected to increase 15.9 percent in the 
second quarter, 14.2 percent in the third quarter, and 11.5 percent 
in the fourth quarter. With an upward revision in the durable goods 
manufacturing sales forecast, the second and third quarter sales 
expectations are higher than those made in February. Nonelectric and 
electric machinery manufacturers—the District's major durable 
industries—look for substantial sales gains, while District food 
processors—the major nondurable goods producers—expect very little 
growth during the last half.
