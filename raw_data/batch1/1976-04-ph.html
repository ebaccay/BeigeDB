      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia

     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Third District have improved for the 
  second month in a row. Retailers continue to experience strong 
  sales, manufacturers report higher levels of new orders and 
  shipments, and the factory workweek has lengthened. However, job 
  gains in manufacturing have been slight and inventories are 
  unchanged from last month. The outlook for the longer term in 
  manufacturing is for additional expansion and more robust hiring. 
  The market for existing housing is reported to be very active, 
  although only limited recovery is taking place in new construction. 
  Bankers report that loan demand is still weak. On the price front, 
  reports of higher costs are more widespread than last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers, responding to the latest business outlook 
  survey, report that the level of economic activity is substantially 
  higher this month. Almost 60 percent of the businessmen surveyed 
  report an improvement in general business conditions. This is the 
  second month in a row that one-half or more of the respondents have 
  indicated gains. Half the manufacturers also report specific gains 
  for new orders and shipments. At the same time, inventories, which 
  increased in March, show little change from last month's levels. 
  Stocks are up in the fabricated metals industry but down in 
  chemicals. Despite expanded output in manufacturing (which holds 
  equally for durables and nondurables), job gains have been small 
  during the past month. The average workweek, however, has lengthened 
  somewhat.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in manufacturing for the next 6 months is for additional 
  expansion. Of the executives polled, 8 out of 10 expect a higher 
  level of economic activity by October. Almost three-fourths 
  anticipate an increase in either new orders or shipments. At the 
  same time, close to half the respondents plan to add to their 
  inventories over the period. Job openings are expected to pick up: 
  half the respondents plan to hire additional employees, and 3 out of 
  10 anticipate a longer average workweek. An increase in spending for 
  plant and equipment is projected by 40 percent of those polled, 
  about unchanged from last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the price front, 46 percent of the manufacturers polled indicate 
  they are paying higher prices for their supplies. This is up from 
  last month, when 35 percent were reporting increases. At the same 
  time, 20 percent report higher prices for their finished products—about the same as in March. Higher prices are expected to accompany 
  the expansion over the next two quarters. Four-fifths of the 
  respondents expect to be paying more for their supplies, and three-fifths anticipate charging more for their finished products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail executives paint a bright sales picture, with current volume 
  above their expectations. One merchant, who was looking for sales to 
  be about 10 percent above year-ago levels, notes that the gain is 
  closer to 14 percent, All of the executives contacted report that 
  most lines of merchandise are selling well. Men's fashions are 
  singled out as exceptionally strong, and one retailer notes a 
  resurgence in big-ticket items such as refrigerators and other 
  appliances for the home. The outlook for the next few months is "very bullish," but there is general agreement that the major sales 
  momentum for 1976 will occur in the first half of the year. Calendar 
  factors and an expected pickup in inflation later in the year are 
  cited as the reasons for this assessment. No significant movement in 
  prices is reported, and one retailer notes that his prices "are not 
  much higher than a year ago due to a conscious effort to be 
  competitive." He adds that, by the end of 1976, prices charged in 
  his stores will be about 5 percent above year-end 1975. Inventories 
  are said to be in "fine shape," and no problems with deliveries are 
  reported. Retailers note that they are receiving 90-95 percent of 
  their deliveries on time. Area merchants indicate that they 
  encountered no problems as a result of the recent Teamster's strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      The residential housing market in the area is reported to be brisk 
  for existing housing, but only limited recovery is taking place in 
  new construction. Work reportedly is beginning again on unfinished 
  multifamily housing in the region, but little new construction is 
  anticipated in the near future. One MSB official notes that savings 
  inflows have been very strong and that mortgage rates have declined. 
  He quotes the best rate at his institution currently as 8 3/4 
  percent, with the top of the range at 9 1/4 percent. This executive 
  sees the possibility of further declines in rates before they begin 
  moving up gradually around midyear. He adds, however, that the rise 
  in rates through the end of 1976 will have little dampening effect 
  on the housing market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers report that loan volume remains flat. All of the 
  executives contacted indicate that consumer loans are inching up, 
  but they don't consider this movement significant. It's agreed that 
  business loans are weak, and more frequent contacts with customers 
  to try to generate more use of existing lines of credit are 
  reported. Bankers are mixed in their forecasts of a pickup in loan 
  demand. One contact notes that, with inventory accumulation taking 
  place, loan volume should begin to move up by midyear. Another 
  projects an expansion in loans by the fourth quarter. This official 
  feels that, if businesses want to share in the recovery, they can't 
  continue to reduce receivables and inventories much longer. All of 
  the bankers contacted feel that short-term interest rates are at 
  their floor; but there's uncertainty as to when rates will begin to 
  move up, since earlier expectations were for rates to be increasing 
  by this time.
