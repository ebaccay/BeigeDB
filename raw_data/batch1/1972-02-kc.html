      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <p>
       Phase II policies, and competitive market forces operating in an 
economy performing well below its potential, are apparently 
combining to moderate the pace of rising prices. A survey of 
purchasing agents and managers in the Tenth District indicates that 
they perceive (1) a somewhat slower rate of price rise for materials 
they purchase, (2) generally good compliance by vendors with Phase 
II guidelines, and (3) the existence of market forces also acting to 
restrain price increases. Inventory policy is quite conservative, 
with little buildup of stocks now anticipated, almost regardless of 
industry. Among District banks, consumer installment lending and 
agricultural loan demand remain strong, while local business loan 
demand has shown little change in recent weeks from its basically 
weak position.
      </p>
      <p>
       The view from the desks of purchasing managers in the Tenth District 
seems to be favorable to Phase II, with overall understanding and 
compliance felt to be generally good. Specific comments suggest 
that, as far as purchasing agents are concerned, vendors generally 
appear to be following the Phase II guidelines. Purchasing agents 
for a number of firms regularly review suppliers' prices for 
compliance, some require invoices to be stamped as in accordance 
with Price Commission rulings, and others report that notices of 
price rises are accompanied with word that they have been cleared 
with the Price Commission. Yet increasing prices continue to
dominate the scene as the purchasing managers see it. Although they 
may report that they see no evidence of unauthorized price 
increases, there is also some muted criticism of extensive price 
rises that have received approval from the Price Commission. 
Finally, it should be noted that several purchasing managers expect 
further significant price increases in the months ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is, however, evidence of a positive influence of competition 
in restraining price increases. Although some purchasing agents have 
received "feelers" from vendors for price increases, these have 
often been withdrawn following challenge by the buyers. Other 
purchasing agents report that cash discounts are now somewhat more 
readily available than in 1971. With market conditions apparently 
tending to moderate the upward movement of prices, the overall 
situation (as given by the results of this survey) may be summarized 
in the comment from one purchasing manager: on balance, prices show 
"an inching forward (but) not the mass increases of a year ago." 
There are, of course, significant exceptions such as textiles (both 
cotton and rayon) whose rapidly rising prices were noted by two 
firms that are heavy users of textiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports are mixed concerning the nonprice conditions surrounding the 
sale of materials. Some individual buyers note that suppliers have 
maintained their services and have made no attempt to modify their 
contract terms. However, many suppliers now are often cautious about 
quoting prices very far into the future, and unwilling to enter into 
yearly contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The continued performance of the economy below its potential is 
reflected in the widespread absence of delivery problems across 
several very different kinds of industries. At the same time, 
virtually none of the firms interviewed expect at this time to add 
substantially to inventories except on a seasonal basis. Major users 
of metals report they are still working down substantial carryovers 
of steel inventories. Reports of further inventory reductions, and 
no inventory buildupâ€”sometimes in spite of increased sales 
expectationsâ€”came from a number of firms in widely disparate 
industries such as electrical cable and wiring manufacturing, sewage 
treatment equipment, metal building manufacturing, pesticide 
production, rubber belting makers, private aircraft manufacturing, 
and a large chain of drug-and-sundries stores. All in all, inventory 
policies are expected to be ''conservative this year."
      </p>
      <p>
       The decline in the prime rate at New York banks has not been fully 
reflected in the lending rates of Tenth District banks. Of 
necessity, most banks must follow the New York prime movements on 
the accounts of their national customers. However, many District 
banks have established, or are attempting to establish, a "local" 
prime for their large regional borrowers. This rate is not only 
higher than the national rate, but has not been dropping as rapidly. 
Those banks that have not adopted this tactic are simply making 
fewer loans at prime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer loan rates have not been adjusted downward at all in most 
banks, and only moderately at the others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local business loan demand has not changed significantly in recent 
weeks from its basically weak position. Several banks report a 
slackening in the use of credit lines by national companies. Local 
real estate loan demand is showing some signs of tapering off, but 
remains strong. Especially strong agricultural loan demands have 
been experienced by Omaha, Denver, and Kansas City banks. Consumer 
installment lending continues at a high level.
      </p>
      <p>
       An accelerated inflow of time deposits was noted by most area 
bankers. Several banks have suspended issuing consumer CD's beyond 
six months or a year, but this has not deterred the buildup of 
consumer time and savings deposits. Flows into large certificates of 
deposit have also picked up.
