       Total loan demand at most Tenth District banks remains strong. 
Savings inflows to Tenth District savings institutions improved in 
January, and demand for mortgage money has increased somewhat. 
However, residential construction activity is expected to remain 
weak during the first half of this year. The Colorado ski industry 
is booming in spite of the national energy shortage. Relatively 
small inventories of grains and of cattle are contributing to 
further strengthening in the prices of farm products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interviews with larger Tenth District banks reveal deposit and loan 
activity about in line with seasonal expectations, although a few 
banks noted a greater than seasonal decline in commercial demand 
deposits in the last few weeks. Consumer demand and time deposits 
have shown very little change. An undesired buildup in the volume of 
large CD's at some District banks is being countered by a 
progressive lowering of CD offering rates. Loan demand continues 
strong at most banks. The total volume of real estate loans has 
remained stable as declines in residential lending are being offset 
by increases in commercial real estate loans. Business loan demands 
for normal inventory and capital expansion needs are being augmented
by attempts to stockpile materials that might soon be in short 
supply. Among the special situations noted were a nearly insatiable 
desire for oil drilling equipment and the money needed to finance 
its purchase in Tulsa, and strong loan demand from ski resorts in 
Colorado. Consumer demand for auto loans is declining, but only 
gradually, and is being partly replaced by increases in charge card 
and other personal borrowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       January savings inflows to savings and loan institutions in the 
Tenth District exceeded the industry's expectations. Inflows were 
also greater than mortgage demand, permitting some needed buildup of 
liquidity. Demand for residential mortgage money has begun to 
increase somewhat. Savings and loan officers seem to expect a slight 
improvement in their business, although the energy shortage and 
other elements of uncertainty are combining to make the future even 
less clear than usual. Rates of 8 1/2 percent on 80 percent loans 
and 8 3/4 percent on 90 percent loans are fairly general across the 
District.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to executives of home builders associations in major 
District cities, residential construction is not expected to improve 
much in the first half of 1974 over a bad second half last year. 
However, a "substantial" pickup is anticipated by July—possibly 
before, in some areas. Nearly all associations are jumping on the 
"buy now" campaign bandwagon, emphasizing inflationary expectations 
in the housing market. Building materials prices continue to rise 
rapidly, and some things are reported as hard-to-get in certain 
areas—e.g., window glass, steel reinforcing bars and I-beams, 
plastics, insulating materials, and plumbing fixtures. Limitations 
on utility hookups to new houses do not appear to be a major concern 
yet (except in Colorado), although there is some speculation about 
possible future effects. Housing contractors in the Kansas City area 
are more concerned with the possible negative impact on suburban 
building of a continued gasoline shortage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The national energy shortage has apparently had little negative 
impact on the Colorado ski industry. Business at major ski areas is 
reported to be "very good," and "operating at capacity and booked up 
for the year." Most respondents reported that, compared to past 
years, more people are arriving by bus and air transportation, 
including special tours, rather than by private automobile. One 
local air carrier that serves Colorado ski areas reported a 50 
percent increase in revenue passengers during the Christmas 
holidays, compared with a year earlier. However, New Mexico ski 
areas, which are more dependent on auto transportation, have had a 
significant decline in their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farm prices spurted sharply last month, rising 9 percent from mid-December to a level nearly 40 percent above a year ago. Contributing 
most to the increase were higher prices for cattle, hogs, and most 
grains, and cotton. Recent reports from the USDA suggest, moreover, 
that farm prices will remain quite strong for several months. With 
the exception of soybeans, January 1 grain stocks were not only 
below year-earlier levels but were even tighter than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cattle on feed numbers were 6 percent below a year ago, and the all-cattle inventory, while larger, was smaller than anticipated. 
Therefore, another round of strong farm prices seems likely in the 
months ahead. One factor looming large in this scenario, however, is 
the current truckers' strike. Reports on the effect of the strike 
are still sketchy, but the livestock industry has grave concerns 
about a protracted shutdown. A survey of markets in the District 
shows that livestock shipments have slackened considerably, but that 
prices are holding up fairly well thus far. However, some price 
weakness is expected for slaughter animals if the strike continues 
because the packing plants are rapidly cutting back on their 
operations. With the number of animals in the heavier weight groups 
being up 40 percent from a year ago, a lengthy truck strike will 
ultimately result in a backlog of fleshy animals which, when finally 
slaughtered, likely will break prices in a manner similar to the 
post-freeze pattern last September.
