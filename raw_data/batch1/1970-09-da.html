      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 9, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Data for this report were gathered by telephone interviews with 
branch board directors in' early September. On balance, the 
directors appeared to be cautiously optimistic. They noted that the 
slowdown never got too severe and there are now some signs of a 
modest pickup in business. Inflation is still strong in the view of 
most directors. The bankers reported a continuation of heavy loan 
demand, but also improved liquidity positions at their banks during 
the last three months. A few bankers expect the prime rate to be cut 
before the end of the year, an expectation based on noneconomic 
reasons. Construction may have picked up slightly in very recent 
weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions are generally regarded as somewhat stronger now 
than three months ago. Several of the bankers noted that business 
never got particularly bad and that conditions now appear to have 
leveled out or picked up in the last three months. Several of the 
nonbank directors noted that their firms' orders had picked up 
recently, and they looked for some expansion in orders for the rest 
of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      While a few directors see price pressures easing, most list the 
continuation of inflation as a major concern. Those who do see some 
signs of abatement in price inflation refer particularly to selected 
goods prices, while appearing discouraged about services prices. The 
nonbankers reported that prices of inputs were not rising quite as 
fast in the most recent weeks as earlier this year, except perhaps 
for machinery parts. Product price declines were reported by two 
directors, one due to a local market milk-price war and the other to 
generally slack demand for paper and paper products over the past 
six to nine months. All directors expressed concern over the price 
of labor. One voiced a fear that the minimum wage would be raised 
and possibly tied to the CPI,
      <br/>
      a move, if adopted, that he considered 
certain to add to cost pressures in the months ahead. A number of 
directors cited the auto negotiations as crucial in either setting a 
pattern of moderate wage increases or excessive wage increases. 
There was some feeling that the outlook for inflation would improve 
if the auto settlement was moderate (below 8 percent in first-year 
wages).
     </p>
     <p>
      The bankers were almost unanimous in reporting that liquidity 
positions at their banks had improved in comparison with three 
months ago. The only banker reporting a worsening in his liquidity 
position cited seasonal factors as the cause and expected 
improvement in October. The bankers were split about evenly on 
whether liquidity was still a serious problem for firms in their 
area. The nonbankers, however, indicated that they did not feel 
liquidity was a problem for firms in their industry. On balance, it 
appears that liquidity is of much less concern now than a couple of 
months ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand is reported strong by most bankers. Over half reported 
that loan demand was greater now than three months ago, while many 
who judged their loan demand to be weaker or the same as three 
months ago still characterized that demand as strong. Real estate 
loans were reported especially strong in several areas, and one 
banker noted heavy demand for feedlot and cattle loans. Banks in 
Corpus Christi, Texas, face heavy loan demand from individuals and 
businesses desiring to repair damage from Hurricane Celia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most bankers reported that the recent reserve requirement changes 
would ease their bank's position only slightly, with the move viewed 
as being more psychological than substantive. There were indications 
that the ease in reserve positions would improve liquidity but would 
not lead, at least directly, to additional loan commitments. One 
large Houston bank reports that it is considering abandoning the 
sale of commercial paper as a result of the reserve requirement 
changes. This bank would expect to concentrate more effort on 
increasing its volume of large CD's outstanding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions do not currently justify a further cut in the 
prime rate, according to District directors. Several expect a cut, 
however, before the end of the year because of political and public 
relations considerations. Two bankers indicated that they had not 
yet lowered their prime rate from 8 1/2 percent and might maintain 
that rate even if most banks make another cut in the next few 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs of a pickup in construction activity in recent months were 
noted by some bankers, but no strong rebound is reported. One banker 
commented that many construction companies were forced out of 
business during the last 18 months so that it may take some time for 
resources to move back into the industry. The few areas where 
construction strength was cited were FHA-235 housing, university and 
local government construction, and gas drilling.
