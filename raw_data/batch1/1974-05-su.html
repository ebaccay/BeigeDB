      <p>
       Latest Redbook comment suggests that the recent business slowdown 
has bottomed out and that the economy may now be in a mild, though 
fragile, recovery. Heavy demands f or capital goods appear to be the 
main element undergirding the current level of activity. Fuel 
shortages are reported to have eased substantially, although 
shortages of industrial materials, most notably steel, remain a 
serious constraint on production growth. Reports on consumer 
spending are spotty, with some Districts reporting retail sales as 
"good" or "holding up well" while others note a softening of demand 
for big-ticket items and a leveling off in sales of nondurables. The 
housing sector is uniformly described as weak and, in the light of 
recent interest rate behavior, as likely to weaken further. All 
Districts report persisting inflationary expectations, which along 
with recent sharp price increases and fears of acute materials 
shortages, are causing large demands for inventory financing. 
Current comment contains many more references than usual to 
financial stringencies and liquidity problems, in both the business 
and banking communities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most bullish area of the economy clearly is the capital goods 
sector. Chicago reports that the capital goods boom in the Seventh 
District "continues at full throttle" and this theme is echoed in 
the reports from Cleveland and St. Louis. The New England machine 
tool industry is also reported as operating at capacity. Materials 
and other shortages, however, are mentioned as seriously impeding 
output growth in this sector. Chicago, for example, notes shortages 
of metals (especially steel), chemicals, packaging materials, 
components, trained manpower, and transportation as factors limiting 
output. Output in the Chicago District was also reported to have 
been hampered by strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       As regards the consumer sector, several Districts report an 
improvement in sales of medium-sized and large automobiles, and 
Chicago notes that automobile firms "are pressing for delivery of 
additional steel for large car production which has increased." 
Atlanta and Chicago also report increased demand for recreational 
vehicles. While retail sales are in general characterized as good, 
some Districts note that price increases account for much, if not 
most, of the reported gains. Boston, Dallas, Richmond, and St. Louis 
report a leveling of sales, with the last two indicating a softening 
of demand for big-ticket items.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports on inventories suggest efforts in some industries to build 
stocks of materials as a hedge against both rising prices and future 
shortages. A Cleveland survey found stocks depleted in some steel, 
coal, oil, machinery, chemical, and packaging firms, with 
respondents indicating that they would like to rebuild their 
inventories. Capital goods producers are said to be unable to build 
inventories because of heavy demand pressures and shortages of 
materials and components. Minneapolis reports some involuntary 
accumulation of goods in process due to materials and component 
shortages. In some lines, however, reports suggest inventory 
accumulation may be leveling off. Dallas reports that retail 
inventories are being held down while Boston and Minneapolis 
indicate that high interest costs may be discouraging stock 
building. Also Richmond reports a significant increase in the number 
of manufacturing respondents indicating general satisfaction with 
the current level of inventories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Districts reporting on housing indicate continued weakness in this 
sector, with prospects that the recent sharp run-up in interest 
rates will pinch off any recovery that may have been underway. Most 
Districts report extremely tight mortgage market conditions, with 
six Reserve Banks reporting a significant amount of 
disintermediation at either thrift institutions or commercial banks 
or both. New York characterizes the disintermediation at Second 
District thrift institutions as severe.
      </p>
      <p>
       All District reports describe business loan demand as "strong" or 
"very strong," although Boston and Kansas City indicate some 
leveling of demand at a high plateau. Inventory financing is 
generally reported as a major factor behind this demand. Most 
reports suggest that increases in demands for this purpose are 
attributable mainly to higher prices of inventoried goods although 
some Districts indicate that expanded stocks of materials are also a 
factor. New York and Chicago also report that delays in construction 
projects and sizable inventories of unsold houses may be 
contributing to loan demand. Some shifting of capital market 
borrowing to banks was also reported as a factor behind business 
loan demand by New York and San Francisco. Several Districts noted 
increased demand for accounts receivable financing and a
substitution of bank credit for commercial paper sales, especially 
by REIT's, as contributing factors. Chicago, Richmond, and 
Minneapolis reported strong demand for farm credit because of 
increasing difficulty being encountered by farmers in arranging 
trade credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several Districts cite increasing liquidity problems for businesses 
as well as for thrift institutions and commercial banks. Boston and 
Kansas City report vigorous complaints against tight money policies 
in some quarters, with Boston indicating financial stringencies for 
public utilities and insurance firms. A number of Districts report 
that banks are becoming increasingly selective in screening loan 
applicants and some Districts indicate a growing reluctance on the 
part of the banks to finance loan expansion through high cost CD 
financing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agricultural outlook is reported generally good for crops, but 
low market prices and high production costs are a problem in the 
livestock sector. St. Louis reports that resulting production 
cutbacks could mean higher red meat prices later this year.
