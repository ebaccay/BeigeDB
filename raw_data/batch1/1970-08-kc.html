      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 12, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The effects of the national economic recession continue to be felt in the Tenth 
District. Weakness appears to be fairly widespread, both geographically and by 
type of business, and there is a general air of uneasiness and apprehension. 
Although activity remains fairly strong in much of the Rocky Mountain, Nebraska, 
and Oklahoma areas, unemployment, strikes, rapid increases in personal 
bankruptcies, and a slowing down in payment of accounts were referred to 
frequently by Board members, bankers, and other businessmen. In addition, the 
existence of hot weather and a number of exceptionally dry areas in this 
agriculturally oriented region give rise to locally gloomy moods and pockets of 
especially slow business activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most commercial banks reported some success in efforts to improve their 
liquidity position during the past month. Country banks generally enjoyed 
increasing deposits because of an excellent wheat harvest and a large influx of 
Government payments. City banks have had a slower growth rate during this 
period, with all of the increase being in time deposits. Demand deposits have 
declined, with decreasing individual, corporate, and U. S. Government demand 
accounts in city banks more than offsetting a alight increase in interbank 
accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand continues to remain strong in city banks, but is generally nominal 
in country banks where deposits have increased rather sharply. City banks report 
many requests from corporate borrowers to back their commercial paper 100 per 
cent with lines of credit. These city banks believe the commercial paper market 
has stabilized and these lines will not be called upon if additional 
catastrophes can be avoided.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several large banks in the Kansas and Western Missouri region reported 
increasing collection difficulties and a marked increase in voluntary individual 
bankruptcies. The voluntary bankruptcies were most frequent among credit card 
users. In these cases individuals tend to maximize their borrowings from all 
sources, including credit cards, and then file for bankruptcy. This region 
includes Kansas City, which continues to be plagued with a prolonged 
construction strike, now in its fifth month. The slowdown in the aerospace and 
air transport industries also has had the severest impact on the 
Kansas-Missouri 
region.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial construction activity appears to be slowing in the 
District, thus supporting the notion of reduced business fixed investment 
spending. Several large firms have reported cutting proposed capital investment 
plans substantially during the past few months to make sure that they would live 
within their cash flow. Although firms may not be able to do all the capital 
spending they would like, there continues to be a need to replace and update 
equipment in order to improve productivity—and such spending received first 
priority. While business construction is off, homebuilding appears to be showing 
some evidence of recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      The petroleum industry is confronted with a unique problem. Until recently, 
imported crude could be delivered on the east coast at substantially lower 
prices than could domestic crude. This price differential discouraged domestic 
exploration for oil. With the recent difficulties in the mid-east, tanker rates 
have increased by as much as 300 per cent, and imported crude now sells at about 
75 cents per barrel above domestic crude on the east coast. Thus, domestic crude 
prices are under pressure, and at least one oil company has announced price 
increases in the Tenth District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business is slow for District farm implement dealers. Inventories are relatively 
large, and cases of price cutting are not uncommon. Collections on credit sales 
are reported to be noticeably slower than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The interrelatedness of Tenth District economic activity with both national and 
international business conditions is illustrated by the experience of a Kansas 
City manufacturer of bottling and automatic vending equipment. This firm's total 
business is about unchanged from a year ago, with increasing international 
business about offsetting a definite decline in domestic sales. The decline in 
domestic sales is attributed to reduced overtime and lower employment in 
factories with vending machines, as vending machine operators drop routes and 
defer the purchase of new equipment. There is some concern within the firm that 
their growing international business will be hurt by retaliations against U. S. 
restrictions on imports.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aircraft industry is having trouble from production down through the 
transport phases. Unemployment in Wichita, where the aerospace industry is 
important, is reported in excess of 10 per cent. Tulsa also reports difficulties 
in the industry. The air transport industry, which is important in several 
District centers, reports continued problems in revenue and unemployment. 
Although pleasure travel appears to be holding up reasonably well, business 
travel has been off sharply. Most airlines have found it difficult to operate 
much above year-earlier levels and, with the introduction of the 747's which 
were contracted for on the basis of an average 10-15 per cent increase in 
passenger traffic, it has been difficult to meet costs. Preliminary data 
indicate that passenger traffic in July improved. But substantial improvement 
over an extended period of time will be necessary to solve current air transport 
problems.
