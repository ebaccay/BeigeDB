      Beige Book Report: New York

     <p>
      <strong>
       January 14, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The business outlook for 1976 on balance is relatively good, in the 
views of Second District directors, other business leaders, and 
financial economists who were contacted recently. Real gross 
national product (GNP) is expected to grow over the year. The 
Christmas and post-Christmas retail selling seasons have been 
successful. While retail sales continue to provide the main prop 
under the recovery, some respondents expected some reinforcement 
from the inventory accumulation now underway and, after mid-year, 
from business capital spending. The outlook for corporate profits 
was, for the most part, regarded as good.
       </p>
       <p>
        We recently requested our directors and a number of financial 
economists for their appraisal of the business outlook for 1976. In 
varying degrees, the respondents in general were cautiously 
optimistic. Among others, the president of a large nationwide 
department store chain expected real GNP to grow by about 5 1/2 
percent over the year. He expected consumer spending to continue to 
provide the principal stimulus during the first half of 1976, and to 
be reinforced by a pickup in capital spending by mid-year. He felt 
unemployment would decline throughout the year, but would remain 
above 7 percent. In his view, barring poor crops, there was hope 
that the rise in consumer prices could be held in a 5 to 7 percent 
range. The chairman of a large New York City bank also felt business 
capital spending might pick up after mid-1976. The Buffalo branch 
directors generally agreed that the business outlook was reasonably 
good at this time, with "attractive interest rates" and generally 
good consumer confidence as factors supporting this favorable 
outlook. A senior economist at a large New York City bank expected a 
"good, balanced, and sustainable" expansion this year, with real GNP 
growing by 5 to 5 1/2 percent. As yet, however, he saw no evidence 
of any significant pickup in capital spending in real terms. He 
expected such outlays to rise by 8 to 10 percent in dollar terms, 
with a token increase in real terms in the last part of the year. 
This economist also expressed "some worry" over the possible impact 
on inflation of the potential terms of the settlements of the many 
wage negotiations coming up in 1976. Another bank economist stated 
he was cautiously optimistic on 1976, and that the recovery was 
taking hold and should result in a rate of real growth of 5 to 6 
percent, in his view a very reasonable performance under present 
conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        As noted, consumer spending continues to provide the main thrust to 
the current economic recovery. In this regard, the president of the 
large chain of retail stores mentioned above reported that the 
Christmas selling season had been "good to excellent," with sales 
exceeding expectations, even in New York City where sales have 
lagged behind the nationwide performance. The chairman of a large 
New York City department store reported the holiday season had ended 
on a very strong note, with sales intensifying the closer Christmas 
approached. Similar observations were made by a number of other New 
York City retailers. A survey of large New York City department 
stores revealed that Christmas and post- holiday consumer buying had 
lifted their December sales to a level 8 percent above December 
1974, the largest increase in 16 months. The performance in the 
suburbs was even better, with sales in the metropolitan area nearly 
11 percent over the comparable period of 1974—the biggest increase 
in 23 months. District sales outside the New York City area were 
also strong. An upstate banker noted that holiday sales in his area 
had substantially exceeded expectations. The Buffalo branch 
directors were in general agreement that the Christmas selling 
season in Western New York had been good, with sales, in dollar 
terms, running 8-10 percent above year-earlier levels. These 
directors, moreover, reported that the holiday season increase in 
retail buying has been followed by good Sales so far in 1976. In 
their view, however, the mood of consumers appears to be mixed. 
Consumers have discretionary spending money and seem to show little 
resistance to spending for recreation, travel, and small-ticket 
items. Inflation, job insecurity, and economic uncertainties in 
general, however, tend to be reflected in a more cautious attitude 
toward the demand for big- ticket items.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding corporate profits, the great majority of the respondents 
looked for an increase in 1976. Among others, the president of the 
retail chain stated that the outlook for such profits was 
"excellent", as productivity was improving dramatically while the 
volume of sales was rising. Against this background, he expected 
profits after taxes to gain about 30 percent next year. For the same 
reasons, one of the bank economists expected profits to rise 
throughout 1976, also by 30 percent for the year. All of the Buffalo 
branch directors also expected corporate profits to increase in 
1976, in reflection of emphasis on expense control coupled with 
increased consumer spending. Their estimates, however, ranged from 
rather modest increases to as high as 25 percent above 1975. 
Exceptions to the rather optimistic profit outlook were voiced by 
directors associated with the petroleum and the metal industries, 
who did not expect these industries to fare well during 1976.
