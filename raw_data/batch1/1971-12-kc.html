      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 8, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Increased volume of crop marketings and higher livestock prices are 
boosting farm income and the agribusiness sector of the Tenth 
District economy, despite the negative impact of the dock strike on 
grain prices. Retail sales during the early part of the holiday 
season have been moderately stronger than last year's pace in the 
major metropolitan areas of the District. With demand deposits 
falling more than seasonally in November and business loan demand 
strengthening, bankers are resisting further commercial loan rate 
reductions. Mortgage rates, however, have eased in recent months, 
including a marked decline in late November in several District 
cities. Savings and loan institutions—still enjoying strong savings 
inflows—and builders are optimistic on the outlook for construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       District cash receipts from farm marketings for the first three 
quarters totaled $5.9 billion—4 per cent above the
       <br/>
       year-earlier 
figure. Fourth quarter receipts should show a good advance over last 
year, with most of the increase reflecting sharply higher prices for 
livestock. Lower wheat and feed grain prices will probably more than 
offset an increased volume of marketings—pushing crop receipts down. 
Since the livestock sector accounts for roughly two-thirds of the 
District's farm income, retrenchment of crop prices and the 
disruptive effects of the dock strike have not seriously depressed 
the aggregate farm income picture. Large quantities of wheat were 
shipped abroad before October 1 in anticipation of a further 
widening of the dock strike. Feed grains and soybeans—the two 
commodity groups most affected by the strike—are relatively less 
important in the District than elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several agribusiness firms were contacted about their 1971 sales and 
also their prospects for next year. Suppliers of fertilizers, 
pesticides, and grain-storage equipment reported good years—attributing their gains largely to the sharp increase in crop 
acreage. But two feed manufacturers indicated that sales have been 
slipping, although they expect a modest improvement for the year as 
a whole. Farm machinery sales—which had been sluggish for three 
years—spurted in the third quarter and are continuing to run well 
above year-ago figures. Bumper crops and anticipated tax credits 
were offered as explanations. Agribusiness firms were generally 
optimistic about sales prospects. The consensus was that prices 
would show little, if any, additional upward pressure—although the 
manufacturers of farm implements and grain-storage equipment 
reported that some increases were likely in view of higher steel and 
other costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales throughout the District appear to be running somewhat 
stronger than a year ago, although only a few reports suggest a real 
loosening up by consumers. Most officials of the major department 
stores surveyed are cautious in discussing their holiday sales to 
date, using such terms as "satisfactory," "disappointing," and "no 
great shakes." Some specialty and jewelry shops report substantial 
sales increases, but no movement toward expensive items is 
discernible in department stores. Sales of wine and liquor by one 
chain of stores were described as only slightly improved over last 
year's mediocre levels. Meanwhile, ski areas are setting new 
attendance records.
      </p>
      <p>
       District commercial banks report a more than seasonal fall-off in 
demand deposits during November as offsetting considerable growth in 
consumer saving deposits. A large November volume of business loans 
contrasts with the weak pattern of other recent months. Rate 
structures were lowered in early November to a level consistent with 
a 5 1/2 per cent prime or base rate; the strength of loan demand at 
that rate has stiffened resistance to further downward movement. 
Unlike a month ago, bankers now say they would resist going below 
their own stated prime rate even on national accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past two or three months, supply-demand conditions of savings 
and loan associations have resulted in a gradual easing of mortgage 
rates and terms. Net savings inflows are down slightly but continue 
strong. The savings and loan associations appear to have benefited 
in November from some reintermediation on the part of savers whose 
high-yield Treasury notes matured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marked declines in conventional mortgage rates occurred in late 
November in several cities. Points charged on FHA-GI loans also have 
declined. Most respondents expect further declines in mortgage rates 
in the next 90 days; the general expectation appears to be of a 
bottoming out in the 7 1/4 to 7 1/2 per cent area on conventional 75 
to 80 per cent of appraised value loans. Many savings and loan 
institutions make 95 per cent loans at 8 to 8 1/4 per cent, but use 
of such mortgages varies greatly and the instruments are not viewed 
with enthusiasm by lenders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction remains healthy in the District. Builders 
look toward strong sales in the spring, particularly of single-family dwellings. In most cities, the outlook is for construction 
activity in the first half of 1972 to equal or exceed the average 
1971 experience. Unless consumer spending greatly accelerates and 
produces an extreme decline in savings inflows, the savings and loan 
associations expect to be able to cope with mortgage loan demand in 
the months ahead.
