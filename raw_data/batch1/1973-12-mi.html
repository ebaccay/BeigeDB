       The lack of fuel has not yet seriously disrupted District business 
activity, but businessmen are worried about the future. All District 
industrial sectors are likely to feel the impact of fuel shortages 
to some extent, but at this point, the District's travel and winter 
recreational industries appear to be especially vulnerable. District 
residents are cooperating with the Administration's efforts to 
conserve energy, and bank directors hope that gasoline rationing can 
be avoided. Several directors expressed the view that it is to early 
to see if the Administration's fuel allocation plans are workable. 
Public concern over fuel shortages is not expected to dampen 
Christmas spending in general, but businessmen are concerned about 
their 1974 sales prospects. District manufacturers look for sizable 
fourth quarter sales gains and expect further increases during the 
first half of 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuel shortages have not yet curbed District business activity, but 
businessmen are concerned about the future. A Northeastern Minnesota 
banker indicated that his area's cement and wood products plants may 
have to reduce operations and his area's important winter 
recreational industry is seriously threatened. Furthermore, he 
believed his area's businessmen have reduced hiring and business 
spending plans. A South Dakota director disclosed that fuel 
shortages will adversely affect his state's travel industry. Area 
motels, for example, are canceling expansion plans and reducing 
their work forces. Also, transportation problems are being 
encountered in shipping agricultural products. A Minnesota director 
whose firm manufactures products for the construction industry was 
very concerned about fuel shortages, but was even more concerned 
about obtaining adequate steel and cement supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major twin cities manufacturers surveyed by this Bank are worried 
but hopeful that they will have adequate fuel supplies to get 
through the winter. A Wisconsin director revealed that his 
community's industries presently have adequate fuel supplies, but 
their operations could be jeopardized if fuel shortages persist. 
Montana directors indicated that their state's recreational and 
tourist industries could be seriously affected by fuel shortages.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to director responses, District businessmen and consumers 
are complying with the Administration's request to conserve energy, 
but it is too early to judge the effectiveness of the 
Administration's fuel allocation plans. Most directors indicated 
that their area's residents are driving slower, turning down their 
thermostats, and eliminating unneeded lighting. Two major utilities 
serving the District, for example, disclosed that their sales in 
November were less than normally would have been expected, given 
temperature conditions. With regard to fuel allocation plans, a 
major twin cities area retailer indicated that a 25 percent 
reduction of fuel from a year ago could cause his firm to reduce 
operations after January 1. Several Minneapolis/St. Paul area 
manufacturers, on the other hand, stated that the fuel allocation 
plans should provide them adequate fuel through the winter. 
Directors expressed general dislike for gasoline rationing and are 
hopeful that existing measures to curb gasoline usage will suffice.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, public concern over fuel shortages is not expected to 
adversely affect Christmas spending, but District retailers are 
concerned about 1974 business prospects. A newspaper survey of 
Minneapolis/St. Paul retailers revealed that they are still hopeful 
for a good Christmas season. With regard to the first six months of 
1974, however, they foresee their sales increasing 5 to 8 percent 
from a year ago as compared to 13 to 15 percent gains realized in 
1973.
      </p>
      <p>
       A large Twin Cities area retailer disclosed that his firm has not 
yet noticed that fuel shortages have had an impact on his firm's 
sales. In the District's agricultural regions, retailers feel this 
year's high farm income points to a good Christmas season. Two 
directors indicated, however, that retailers in their area are 
having difficulty obtaining inventories and could sell more 
merchandise if it was available. A director from the upper peninsula 
of Michigan indicated that fuel shortages and the weather may have 
already dampened his area's consumer spending. Minneapolis/St. Paul 
automobile sales data disclosed that District consumers are turning 
to small- and intermediate-sized cars, shunning purchases of full-sized automobiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the results of our fourth quarter industrial 
expectations survey, taken in early November, District industrial 
activity continued to expand. Third quarter District manufacturing 
sales are up 20.1 percent from a year ago and are expected to 
advance 14.1 percent in the fourth quarter and about 10.5 percent 
during the first half of 1974. These gains are larger than 
respondents anticipated three months ago, and recent price increases 
are probably one factor which caused respondents to revise their 
sales expectations upward. A breakdown of manufacturing sales into 
durable and nondurable goods sales shows that durables increased 
23.7 percent in the third quarter and are anticipated to rise 19.5 
percent in the current quarter. A 14 percent year-to-year sales 
increase is expected during the first half of 1974. Nondurable goods 
sales rose 16.3 percent from a year earlier in the third quarter and 
an 8.2 percent fourth quarter advance is anticipated; sales gains of 
7.0 percent are expected in the first and second quarters of 1974.
