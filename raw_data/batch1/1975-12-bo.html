      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors of the First District remain concerned about the 
recovery. The outlook for energy, state and local governments, and 
capital goods related industries is uncertain. However, Connecticut 
defense contractors are enjoying good business, and most New England 
retail trade bureaus are anticipating a rewarding Christmas season. 
The rate of unemployment for the region was 12.5 percent in October; 
the unemployment rates for Connecticut, Rhode Island, and 
Massachusetts were 11.1 percent, l4.1 percent, and 14.4 percent, 
respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retailing outlook is optimistic throughout New England. Despite 
a sluggish recovery in recent months, retailers are expecting a 
strong Christmas season. One retailing director reports that he had 
planned a 7-percent increase; however, December, so far, is more 
than 14 percent ahead of last year's volume. The director also 
contends that simple "inflation corrections" distort the gains in 
unit sales. Shifting consumption patterns, sales below list prices, 
and only modest increases in list prices in many lines have meant 
that business has been more active than the deflated figures might 
imply. Inventories are purposely thin at retail, wholesale, and 
manufacturing levels. So far, vendor performance has been good, and 
there have been no highly visible price changes. A strong season may 
initiate a scramble for goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business investment for modernization and cost-cutting equipment may 
begin to increase presently; higher interest rates and sales rates 
expected in the future are stimulating businessmen to reconsider 
capital appropriations. Nevertheless, better sales rates do not 
necessarily mean a boom, so expansion plans remain shelved. Several 
directors have become highly skeptical of long-range planning in 
their industries. Basically, planning seems to do little more than 
extrapolate trends, and there seems to be no reason for these trend 
lines to be validated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The carbon black industry continues to face excess capacity; and, 
recently, orders have been canceled. The major reason is that the 
tire industry has little demand for this basic pigment. The machine 
tooling industry has seen no dramatic changes in new orders. 
Manufacturers in capital goods lines are still living off backlogged 
orders. Lumber companies have noted a hopeful turn in business, 
especially in demand related to cartons, crates, and pallets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand is still flat in New England. Businessmen are not 
expected to approach the banks until late spring, according to 
directors. And, despite the retail sales situation, consumer credit 
demands are modest as well. Bankers expect an  8 percent prime by 
the summer of 1976, increasing to almost 9 percent by year-end. 
Recent growth in demand deposits and savings deposits has been used 
to buy Treasuries and the CD's of New York and midwestern banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      This month Professors Eckstein, Houthakker, Solow, and Tobin were 
available for comment. Each was concerned about the prospects for 
recovery and the Federal Reserve's position. Eckstein reports that 
the fourth quarter is weak and the current data are worrisome. He is 
pleased to see signs that the recovery has spread to the housing and 
capital goods industries, but the near-term engine of growth is 
consumption. High savings rates and a slower growth of personal 
income could frustrate a continuation of the recovery. Eckstein does 
not see much merit in cutting the funds rate further. The 
uncertainties of how this short rate influences GNP are such that a 
"wait-and-see" posture is appropriate. However, he stresses that the 
Fed ought to encourage credit markets to welcome businessmen; the 
financial community is scared of everything but "superpaper." The 
capital adequacy spectre should be consigned to the closet, and 
banks should receive more encouragement for making term loans to 
lower-quality borrowers. Eckstein is not happy with the money 
targets as they stand; they would frustrate economic growth by mid-1976. So, he would like to see the funds rate near its current level 
for some time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker is still disturbed by the many wobbles in money growth. 
He feels that the funds rate should not be smoothed and made to move 
in such narrow ranges—such smoothing causes erratic money growth 
and harms the economy. It is a curious monetarism that leads to 
interest rate targets, in his view. He feels the consumer and the 
trade balance are carrying the economy; and he, too, perceives a 
critical weakness in investments. But he still firmly believes that 
there is little the Fed should do other than maintain a steady 5-to 
5.5-percent rate of money growth. His reading of recent price data 
leads him to believe that inflation may be less than 4 percent by 
year-end 1976. The dollar is clearly overvalued, in his opinion; so 
gearing monetary policy to stabilize the current exchange rate may 
be unhelpful, both to the domestic economy and to our trading 
partners.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow foresees a year-over-year growth of 6 percent for 1976, even 
under the most favorable conditions. He sees a fourth-quarter 
deceleration of growth, but it seems to be more than one should 
expect. The economy is softening in a critical manner. If there were 
ever a period when rapid growth is welcome, appropriate, and may be 
accommodated, it is now. He would like to see the Fed hold the funds 
rate at its current level for some time to permit more rapid real 
growth and attendant money expansion. Money growth may need to 
attain rates of 9 to 10 percent for a time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin also sees his fears of an anemic recovery being supported by 
recent data. The strength in final demand is lacking, and 
inventories cannot do everything. His belief is that the funds rate 
should be reduced; holding it steady will not provide the necessary 
spur to investors' incentives or to the credit market's spirits. He, 
too, feels that once things get rolling, we may wish to permit money 
growth to exceed 9 percent for a period. He feels that velocity is 
very volatile and that the Fed should expect neither a continuation 
of its recent spurt nor a surge in money demand to return velocity 
to previous levels. He, too, questions recent monetarism: "Set 
interest rates to stimulate an investment recovery and let the money 
numbers fall where they will." Arbitrary rates of money growth are 
misleading targets for recovery at this time.
