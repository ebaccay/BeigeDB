      Beige Book Report: Dallas

      <p>
       A substantial upturn in national economic activity in the near term 
is generally expected by a sample of business economists in this 
region. These economists, who indicated that economic activity was 
improving moderately in the Southwest before August 15, believe that 
President Nixon's new program will also bring gains to the states of 
Texas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Arizona during the 
remainder of this year and in the first half of 1972. It is 
anticipated that these gains in economic activity will increase 
employment in the District moderately over this period, while the 
unemployment rate will fall. The banking directors on the Boards of 
the Head Office and Branches of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas 
similarly believe that local economic conditions will improve. In 
addition, they anticipate that loan demand will be moderately 
stronger in their respective areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six of the economists are expecting a substantial upturn in economic 
activity in the nation for the near future. Housing, consumer 
spending, and business fixed investment are the sectors which will 
be the major contributing forces to this development. They believe 
that this upturn has already started, or is in the process of 
beginning, and that the improvement will spread throughout the 
economy during the remainder of this year and the first two quarters 
of 1972. While the economists are optimistic about economic 
activity, they indicate little hope for a reduction in the rate of 
inflation. By a slim majority, some reduction in the rate of 
inflation is anticipated for the remainder of this year. However, 
during the first six months of 1972, there is an even split between 
those economists who expect the rate of price increase to fall and 
those who expect it to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the two months immediately preceding the President's 
announcement of the new program, seven of the ten economists 
surveyed indicated that the pace of economic activity in their 
states was improving. Five of the economists stated that the 
unemployment rate in their states was remaining about unchanged, 
while three observed some decline and two noticed a small rise. In 
light of the President's new policies for economic stabilization and 
assuming Congress passes tax legislation similar to that requested 
by the President, most expect economic activity in the District to 
increase moderately during the remainder of this year and in the 
first half of 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eight of the economists believe that these developments will 
moderately increase employment in the District over the rest of this 
year. However, all anticipate further employment gains during the 
first six months of next year. The President's plan to reduce 
Federal employment by 5 percent is anticipated to have very little 
impact upon employment in this District. Nor do the economists 
expect that the East and Gulf Coast dock strikes will have much of 
an impact in the Southwest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Little change in business investment for plant and equipment in this 
District is anticipated for the rest of this year. In 1972, most, 
however, believe that business investment should expand somewhat. 
Little change in Federal Government spending in this District is 
anticipated in either this year or the first half of next year. 
There is an even division among the economists on whether or not 
there will be further cuts in defense contracts and military 
spending in this District.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten of the fourteen banking directors who were surveyed indicated 
that business loan demand has been essentially unchanged in the past 
three months, while five indicated some improvement. A clear 
majority of the banking directors, however, noted moderately 
stronger consumer and mortgage loans. On balance, the respondents 
indicated a greater willingness to make more business loans in the 
past three months, while the sample was evenly divided among those 
who had unchanged or improved their willingness to make consumer 
loans. Willingness to make mortgage loans has, however, remained 
unchanged during the past three months. Nine of the fourteen 
respondents expected moderately stronger overall loan demand in 
their areas in the near term, while five believe that essentially no 
change will occur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The current prime rate charged at the banks of these directors 
ranges from 6 to 8 1/2 percent. However, eight of the bankers are at 
the 6-percent level. Two of the fourteen banks have reduced their 
current prime rate recently. Only one of the fourteen directors 
anticipates a reduction in the prime rate in the near future. The 
respondents indicated that slightly less than 14 percent of the 
outstanding loans were lent at the prime rate, while 18.5 percent of 
their outstanding loans were closely tied to the prime rate. The 
current rate on consumer, real estate, and security loans varies 
widely for the banks surveyed. However, the average in each case is 
close to 8 percent. The average rate paid on passbook savings 
accounts is 4.5 percent and that on three-month, small-denomination 
certificates of deposit is 5 percent.
