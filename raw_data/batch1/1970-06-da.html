      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Eleventh District resemble those for the 
nation as a whole. The slowdown in the pace of economic activity 
seems less pronounced in the District, however, than in the nation. 
Total employment is still edging upward in the District, and the 
value of construction contracts awarded during the first four months 
of 1970 is up sharply from the same period in 1969. The Texas 
industrial production index :has been trending irregularly downward, 
primarily owing to a drop in durables manufacturing. Bank credit and 
total deposits at the Eleventh District weekly reporting banks 
declined in May.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the slowdown in economic activity in the District, inflation 
remains the major concern of businessmen and bankers for the rest of 
1970. This point emerged clearly in recent responses to 
questionnaires from both Head-Office and Branch-Office Board 
members. The Branch Board members further revealed an overall lack 
of confidence that monetary and fiscal policy would succeed in 
bringing inflation under control. They now favor the Federal 
Government's setting up some form of wage-price guidelines to be 
followed voluntarily by business.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total nonagricultural employment in the five states of the District 
continued to increase in April, but the slim gain was less than 
seasonally expected. Manufacturing employment actually declined 
slightly in April. While widespread employment reductions are not 
evident in the District, job opportunities, in relation to the labor 
force, are not as plentiful as a year ago. The unemployment rate has 
increased, and in Texas, for example, initial unemployment insurance 
claims are almost twice as high as a year ago. These aggregate data 
tend to confirm the information given by Board members. Most of the 
Board members indicated that employment reductions were not 
anticipated in their industry, but a comparison of June responses 
with those received in May revealed some slight weakening in 
employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index declined 
in April from the March level and has generally trended downward in 
recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The manufacturing sector, particularly durable goods manufacturing, 
has been the source of weakness in the production index. Petroleum 
mining and refining, however, remained at unusually high levels 
during the spring period, avoiding the usual seasonal decline. 
Petroleum stocks have built up to excessive levels recently, and the 
regulated oil production allowables in the District are generally 
lower for June than for May. This is likely to cause some further 
weakness in Texas industrial production this summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The value of construction contract awards declined in the District 
in April from the March level, but on a cumulative basis the 
January-April 1970 level is nearly one-third higher than in the same 
four months of 1969. The value of residential construction contracts 
so far this year has nearly matched the 1969 level, while 
nonresidential building and nonbuilding construction contracts are 
sharply higher than in the same four months a year ago. Responses of 
District Board members indicate that capital spending plans have not 
been curtailed in most of their firms. One Board member in June and 
one in May did report a substantial downward revision in plans for 
the current year. These capital spending plans are consistent with 
the view of most Board members that sales in their industry are 
either stabilizing or strengthening at the present time. 
Furthermore, nearly all the Board members report that corporate 
planning in their firms for 1971 is based on the expectation of a 
modest increase in sales and profits. Responses indicate that not a 
single Board member expects a decline in sales or profits for 1971.
     </p>
     <p>
      Aggregate data opinions of Board members and responses of District 
retailers all confirm the observation that retail sales have been 
weak so far this year and the real volume of goods sold has probably 
declined. Sales of department stores in the District were very 
sluggish during the last two thirds of May, and in some weeks the 
current-dollar sales actually trailed the figure for the 
corresponding weeks a year ago. Department store sales improved 
noticeably, however, during the first week in June. Auto dealers in 
this District who were contacted recently indicated that the bottom 
of their
      <br/>
      well-known sales decline may have been reached. Sales 
results for the first ten days of June indicated to most that the 
total monthly volume might equal or exceed that in June 1969.
     </p>
     <p>
      The auto dealers contacted generally felt that their sales weakness 
was in total volume and that a noticeable shift in demand to lower 
priced or lesser equipped cars had not occurred. Nonautomotive 
retailers are noting some substitution of lower priced for higher 
priced merchandise. This observation was made mostly by department 
store managers, while more specialized retail establishments 
reported less shift toward lower priced merchandise. Of particular 
note was increased consumer attention on specials for specific items 
or on bargain basement merchandise rather than the regular stock.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bank credit at District weekly reporting banks declined in May, as a 
result of reductions in both loans and securities holdings. Business 
loans fell further in May, following declines in each of the 
previous four months of 1970.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total deposits at the weekly reporting banks also declined in May, 
caused mainly by a drop in demand deposits, much of which 
represented reduced holdings by the United States Government. 
Discount window borrowings and net purchases of Federal funds by the 
Eleventh District member banks also declined in May.
