      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The pace of the nationwide economic recovery remains strong, indeed 
may be gathering momentum, according to Second District directors 
and other business leaders who were contacted recently. The 
improvement in consumer confidence that emerged toward the year-end 
continued unabated during the past month; business inventories by 
and large are in line with sales and in some instances on the low 
side; while the outlook for business capital spending has begun to 
brighten. The economic upswing in this District, however, has lagged 
behind that in the nation generally, as reflected in the relatively 
high level of unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regarding consumer spending, the president of a large nationwide 
chain of department stores reported that his firm's general 
merchandise sales were quite strong in February and were 
substantially above last year's depressed levels. He said he was 
"encouraged" by the continued strength in consumer spending thus far 
this year, coming as it did on the heels of a very good Christmas 
season. A senior official of a large consumer goods-oriented 
conglomerate expected further improvements in the demand for certain 
lines of home furnishings and for color T.V. sets, and reported a 
strengthening in the firm's car rental business. A financial 
economist felt that a strong improvement in consumer confidence was 
underway, citing as evidence the recent shift in the demand for cars 
from small to larger vehicles. Comments regarding retail sales 
developments in the Second District, however, were somewhat more 
restrained. A senior official of a large Buffalo department store 
reported that retail sales in that city had been somewhat sluggish 
during the past month, in large part because of bad weather. He felt 
reasonably optimistic, however, that sales during the spring season 
would "rebound sharply" from the depressed levels of a year ago. 
Similarly, a banker noted that while auto sales in the Buffalo 
metropolitan area were still lagging, stronger sales were being 
enjoyed by dealers in other areas of the country. This observer saw 
developing evidence of a shift in consumer attitudes from caution to 
optimism. The president of an upstate bank reported good retail 
sales in his area over the presidential holidays, while the 
president of a Buffalo suburban bank indicated that sales in the 
Buffalo suburbs were stronger than in the city, with local merchants 
expecting further improvements. In New York City, February retail 
sales by large department stores, paced by sales of apparel, topped 
year-ago levels by 4.5 percent, as against 3.5 percent in January 
and a decline of 4.2 percent in February 1975. Suburban stores also 
put in a stronger performance than City stores, with retail sales 
for the entire metropolitan area rising by 7 percent.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were further reports that business inventories in general have 
now been brought down to—and in some instances below—desired 
levels. Among others, the senior official of the conglomerate 
mentioned above noted that following a big adjustment of inventories 
in 1975, his firm's stocks were now generally well aligned with 
sales. The president of a New York City area bank felt business 
inventories were "low", while the chain store executive indicated 
that retail inventories were fully under control. Another observer 
stated that on balance business inventories had been reduced to the 
point where businessmen's attempts to restock could be expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turning to the outlook for business plant and investment outlays, 
the Buffalo Branch directors agreed that while, at this juncture, 
businessmen continue to make capital outlay decisions cautiously, 
evidence of a more optimistic approach was emerging. Senior 
officials of several nonfinancial concerns stated that while their 
firms currently were planning little change in the level of their 
capital outlays for 1976 as compared to 1975, no further decline was 
contemplated for this year. The president of the retail chain felt 
that new store expansion will continue in the retail sales industry, 
although the major emphasis will remain focused on increasing the 
productivity of existing facilities. The president of multinational 
oil corporation observed that while, as yet, he saw no change in 
business attitudes toward investments in plant and equipment, he 
expected the tempo of capital outlays to quicken hand in hand with a 
continued improvement in business conditions. A financial economist 
opined that, against the background of the strong state of consumer 
spending, the outlook for business outlays for plant and equipment 
had brightened substantially in recent weeks. He reported revising 
upward his earlier projections of no real growth in capital spending 
for 1976, and now expected such spending to gather momentum in the 
third quarter and, especially, in the fourth quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The comparatively lagging state of the District economy was most 
clearly evidenced by the generally poor employment picture. In New 
York City, the unemployment rate (not seasonally adjusted) rose from 
11.5 percent in December to 12.2 percent in January, the highest 
level since World War II. The rise for New York State was slightly 
greater, from 10.3 percent to 11.1 percent, the highest level since 
the Depression. Against this background, concern was expressed that 
the state economy would slip further behind the national economy 
unless more favorable tax, environmental, and regulatory policies 
were pursued by the State. Several respondents in the Buffalo area, 
where that city's unemployment rate is the highest in the State, 
also cited obsolete plants and equipment, heavy tax burdens, high 
labor costs, and shifting markets as contributing to the continued 
closing or relocation from the Buffalo area of plants and outlets. 
Conditions remain even more depressed in Puerto Rico, where the 
unemployment rate is reported to have risen from 19.9 percent in 
December to 21.9 percent in January.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demand for business loans remains sluggish according to most 
respondents expressing a view on the subject, primarily because of 
the currently high levels of corporate liquidity. Several 
respondents, however, expected such demand to rise in coming months 
as the economic upswing gathers momentum. Moreover, several upstate 
bankers reported that while business loan demand remained flat in 
their area, the demand for mortgage and consumer loans had 
intensified.
