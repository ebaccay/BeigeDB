      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 14, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       In the views of the Second District directors and other business 
leaders who were contacted recently, while many firms are critically 
reexamining their capital spending plans, few are cutting back such 
plans, with. the notable exception of utilities. The majority of the 
respondents similarly felt that no major attempts to reduce 
inventories had got underway as yet. At the same time, however, the 
comments of several respondents indicated that somewhat more 
cautious inventory policies might be emerging. Some observers 
expected the 1974 model automobiles to sell out quickly but 
expressed apprehensions about the outlook for demand for the 1975 
models. Views were mixed regarding the prospective strength of 
business loan demand, but there was general agreement that bank 
lending policies had become tighter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding business plant and equipment outlays, the Buffalo branch 
directors felt that despite currently tight conditions in the 
financial market, most corporations were going forward with their 
capital spending plans, prompted by shortages in productive capacity 
and by the need to improve productivity. Among other respondents, a 
senior official of a New York City securities firm reported that 
except for utilities and some other scattered instances, he could 
not discern cutbacks in corporations' longer term capital investment 
plans, a view that was expressed by several other respondents. And 
while a New Jersey banker felt that a continued high level of 
interest rates might eventually lead to some retrenchment in 
business capital outlays, he had seen little of that so far in his 
area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, most of the respondents had observed no major efforts as 
yet to reduce inventories. The official of the securities firm 
stated that notwithstanding the high level of interest rates, the 
current rate of inflation still made it profitable to accumulate 
inventories. Several respondents attributed the high level of 
inventories to the rapid inflation and the frequently long delivery 
lead-times which encouraged businessmen to increase stocks on hand, 
both as a hedge against further price increases and as protection 
against shortages. On the other hand, a senior official of a 
nationwide department store chain attributed the recent buildup in 
that firm's stocks to a shortening of some suppliers' delivery lead-times. A senior economist at a large New York City bank reported 
that whereas until recently the bank's corporate clients had been 
using credit to "invest" in inventories, the rise in interest rates 
combined with the fact that the prices of many commodities were no 
longer rising as rapidly as previously had made the carrying of 
excessive inventories "too costly", and that this had been reflected 
in some slowdown in the rate of accumulation. Similarly, a senior 
official of a large upstate New York firm stated that in view of the 
rise in interest rates and the decline in price of some commodities, 
carrying excess inventories had become "risky".
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding consumer spending, the department store chain official 
reported that his firm's sales had been better than expected during 
the first half of the year. He expected a good second half, although 
the rate of increase would probably be slower. An upstate retailer 
expected an increase in dollar sales over last year's level but 
somewhat lower physical volume. Another director saw the retail 
sales picture as being fairly flat. The New Jersey banker expected 
that retail sales-particularly of automobiles and other big-ticket 
items-would be adversely affected by inflation. In this connection, 
an upstate banker reported a sharp reduction at his bank in consumer 
loans for appliance purchases, although demand for home improvement 
loans remains heavy. Several respondents felt the short-run outlook 
for automobile sales was better today than a few months ago and 
expected a rather quick sell-out of remaining 1974 models. They did 
note, however, that the long-term outlook for auto sales was clouded 
by concern over public acceptance of 1975 models equipped with 
largely unproven catalytic converters and by the uncertainties 
regarding the availability of the lead-free gasoline, required to 
fuel models equipped with
       <br/>
       such anti-pollution devices.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the demand for business loans, the New Jersey 
banker, the securities concern official, and several other 
respondents saw no let-up at this time. On the other hand, several 
upstate bankers felt that such demand had probably peaked, at least 
for the balance of the year, in part, as a result of sluggish 
economic conditions. Similarly, a senior economist at a major New 
York City bank reported that business loan demand at his bank, while 
still high, was tapering off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The respondents in general reported a tightening in banks' lending 
policies. Among others, the New Jersey banker stated that his bank 
had adopted a "hard nosed" lending policy. It was making no new 
commitments and extending only modest amounts to regular customers. 
Similarly, the New York bank economist reported that his firm had 
not taken on new corporate customers for some time and was 
discouraging its regular customers from borrowing for non-productive 
purposes such as accumulation of excess inventories and the 
acquisition of other firms.
