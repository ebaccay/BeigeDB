      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 15, 1975
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        While the Sixth District economy remains below par, several bright 
spots have appeared. Pre-Christmas retail sales were reported as 
very good in many areas of the District because of successful sales 
campaigns and advertising. Tourist activity was very brisk during 
the holiday season. A number of Government contracts have been 
awarded to District industries. Some savings and loan associations 
indicate that they now have mortgage money available. Jacksonville, 
Florida, and the Mobile, Alabama, area have maintained strong 
economies during the present economic sluggishness. However, layoffs 
and a sharper than national rise in unemployment continue in the 
region, and loan delinquencies and bankruptcies remain at high 
levels.
        <p>
         On the bright side, retail sales responded to pre-Christmas sales 
and did well. In Jacksonville, Florida, sales turned around 
completely in the pre-Christmas week; heavy advertising, promotions, 
and price cuts worked. In Tennessee, retail sales also did better 
than expected, as retailers held their January sales before 
Christmas. Only furniture and large appliance sales did not respond 
to price cuts. Louisiana retail sales did very well, except for New 
Orleans where a strike of bus and street-car personnel a week before 
Christmas depressed sales. Whether the strong Christmas sales will 
take away from early 1975 sales is still an unanswerable question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Besides pre-holiday price reductions on many retail items, there is 
evidence of price pressures easing in other areas. Price cuts of 10 
to 15 percent have been passed from cotton to worsted and synthetic 
fabrics into wholesale apparel and finished goods; it remains to be 
seen whether retailers will pass these cuts on to the consumer. A 
Florida director reports that at the wholesale level, there are 
widespread and significant "deals" on tires and other items, which 
are not represented as a price decrease. Fleet purchases of trucks 
are also encountering substantially lower prices in the form of 
grossly inflated trade-ins. In central Florida, apartment complexes 
are lowering rents because of an oversupply of apartments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tourist activity turned unexpectedly brisk during the holiday 
season; Florida's tourist trade was the biggest in history. Disney 
World had to close its gates twice because it was too full. The 
highways to the Florida keys were "bumper to bumper". It was 
theorized that with the economy turning down, a lot of tourists came 
because they were not sure how long it would be before they could 
make it back again. The economy of central Florida has some other 
bright spots. The citrus crop is expected to be good, and the 
industry is hiring many additional workers from the ranks of the 
unemployed. The large phosphate industry is also booming, with the 
demand for fertilizer and other phosphate products at high levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reports indicate that funds are rapidly becoming more readily 
available for the housing industry. Florida's largest savings and 
loan association, located in Miami, plans to accelerate its mortgage 
lending in response to an improving inflow of savings dollars. A 
Tampa-Saint Petersburg savings and loan association is running 
advertisements indicating that it has a million dollars of mortgage 
money to lend. In Georgia, the loan picture is looking up, the 
director of Georgia's Savings and Loan League notes. If the present 
trend toward savings continues, loan applications will be taken on a 
fairly normal basis by the year's end.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Mobile, Alabama, area economy has remained healthy as a result 
of construction on several new plants. Some more good news for the 
area was recently announced: favorable tests were received on a new 
oil well in southeastern Alabama. It is expected to be the largest 
producer on the Gulf Coast in twenty years. The new well was 
confirmed as producing 1,425 barrels of crude oil and 4.38 million 
cubic feet of natural gas per day.
        </p>
        <p>
         Job layoffs continue to be reported around the District. Magnavox 
has laid off 5,000 workers for one month in Tennessee. Ingalls 
Shipyards in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is laying off 500 of its 5,500 
salaried employees; 13,000 workers are out on strike at the 
shipyard. Utilities throughout the District have laid off thousands 
of workers; Florida Power Company has laid off 1,350 people and cut 
their 1975 construction budget by $189 million. In Florida and 
Southern Georgia and Alabama, more than 8,000 lumber mill workers 
have lost their jobs in the prolonged home construction slump, which 
has hit the South harder than any other region. Lumber production 
has been cut 30 percent, and 50 mills have closed. Several District 
apparel manufacturers recently have closed their doors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Alabama bankers report a continuing rise in loan delinquencies, and 
new loan applications are being screened more closely. Contractors 
and suppliers note that payments are slow. An upward movement in 
delinquencies on installment credit was reported in the Nashville, 
Tennessee, area. In the past five months, bankruptcy filings have 
increased sharply in eastern Tennessee. An Atlanta-based credit 
counseling agency has seen an increase in requests for its services 
since last May. At first, new clients came mainly from households 
affected by the inflationary squeeze on their budgets. Since last 
October, however, increased counseling has been attributable to the 
effects of layoffs and increased unemployment. The director of the 
agency mentioned that requests for assistance are coming from people 
of all economic and social levels, including professional people, 
and that the people waiting for counseling "looked like Kiwanis Club 
meeting".
        </p>
        <p>
         A survey of 318 Georgia industries indicates that only 67 expected 
profits to improve this year; two thirds of those surveyed were 
either putting off or cutting back on
         <br/>
         capital-spending plans.
