       In the Tenth District, concern remains high over the pace of 
inflation and the near-term prospects for any improvement, based on 
a telephone survey of a number of purchasing managers. Respondents 
expressed a sense of frustration at current policies to deal with 
inflation, but most were ambivalent at the usefulness or 
desirability of an approach involving controls.* In contrast, the 
agricultural sector was marked by increased concern over the 
likelihood of declining farm prices in the months ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moderate improvement in District economic activity reported in 
the last Red Book continues to be confirmed by reports from 
directors and District bankers, although business loan demand has 
weakened further. At the same time, some loss of strength in deposit 
flows has been noted in recent weeks and expectations of some 
disintermediation are not uncommon.
      </p>
      <p>
       A telephone survey of a sample of purchasing managers elicited the 
view that there had been little change in the pace of inflation. In 
fact, a few, such as relatively large users of steel and steel 
products and rubber users, indicated that there had been some 
quickening of the pace.
      </p>
      <p>
       One firm, a large purchaser of chemicals, did report that, for the 
first time in several years, two successive quarters have gone by 
with no renegotiation of prices on large annual contracts. However, 
other chemical purchasers indicated that there was no abatement in 
the rate of price increases for chemicals. For these firms, most 
recent increases in cost of materials stemmed primarily from higher 
freight charges. A number of other firms also cited higher freight 
charges as the principal reason for increased prices to them. Most 
of the purchasing managers queried said that their firms would try 
to pass higher materials costs on to consumers. However, one did 
indicate that they hoped to absorb some of the higher costs of 
materials by selling more high-margin items.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the course of their remarks dealing with price trends, the 
purchasing managers expressed a sense of frustration at current 
policies to deal with inflation. However, when asked about controls, 
most were ambivalent at the usefulness or desirability of such an 
approach. Though one respondent said that he would favor a price 
freeze and a strict review of all wages, and others were in favor of 
some form of incomes policy, most purchasing managers were wary of 
controls. Their major objection was that any system of price-wage 
controls would undoubtedly require, in their opinion, a massive 
addition to government bureaucracy. Also, some indicated that past 
experience illustrated that controls had loopholes and served only 
to postpone wage and price changes. Even among those who indicated 
that they would not like to see wage and price controls used at this 
time, there was little confidence expressed that present economic 
policies would be able to contain or roll back inflationary forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recent developments in the agricultural sector of the economy tend 
to confirm earlier reports in the Red Book about the likelihood of 
declining farm prices in the months ahead. At the same time, farm 
equipment business in the District is reported as quite soft. The 
prospects for record production levels of corn, grain sorghum, and 
wheat point to a substantial drop in grain prices this fall. In this 
connection, two directors referred to the fact that corn prices 
already have fallen sharply. While such developments might serve to 
dim income prospects for crop farmers, lower feed costs would 
benefit the livestock industry. With improved feeding margins, 
feeder cattle prices may spurt upward by yearend. If this encourages 
producers to carry their animals to heavier slaughter weights, and 
to expand breeding herds, slaughter prices may well fall somewhat 
below projected levels for next spring and the rest of 1972. Thus, 
in the year ahead, it is conceivable that farm prices could serve as 
a source of stability in the overall wholesale price index.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deposit flows into Tenth District banks have not been as strong in 
recent weeks as in the first half of the year. This is true both for 
demand deposits and consumer-type time and savings deposits. 
However, net inflows of large CD's have strengthened somewhat at 
several banks. Larger banks (weekly reporting) in the Tenth District 
experienced a net decline in consumer-type time and savings deposits 
in July, although those bankers contacted did not seem to feel that 
the situation was as bad as might have been expected. The reason 
most frequently cited for declining deposits was increased Treasury 
bill rates, although some also detected an increased tendency to 
draw on savings to finance purchases. District bankers apparently 
are expecting some disintermediation to occur in the next few 
months. The contact at one large bank indicated that his bank has a 
large volume of consumer-type CD's maturing in September, and, under 
certain conditions, they could experience a large outflow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential mortgage and construction loan activity at District 
banks continues strong. In addition, consumer installment loans, 
such as for home remodeling purposes and for automobiles, are 
showing further steady growth. Aside from residential construction 
loans, however, the commercial and industrial loan picture appears 
to be rather spotty. In fact, both recent data and discussions with 
District bankers suggest that business loan demand may have weakened 
further in recent weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       *The telephone survey of purchasing managers was conducted prior to 
President Nixon's August 15 speech on economic policy changes.
