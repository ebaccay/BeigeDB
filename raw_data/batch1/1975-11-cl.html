     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity in the Fourth District improved, except in 
steel where a sharp liquidation of steel inventories was underway. 
Retailers reported that consumers were still buying cautiously. 
Deposit inflows early in November were described as excellent by 
S&amp;Ls contacted, and some S&amp;Ls expressed concern that the supply of 
mortgage credit will be greater than demand. Forecasts submitted to 
this Bank by economists with firms in this district showed larger 
gains in real GNP in the second half than in the first half of 1976 
and continued high rates of inflation throughout 1976.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Manufacturing activity in the district improved, and in some 
industries recovery was strong. Rubber and chemical industries 
rebounded strongly, while recovery in household appliances was slow. 
Tire production and sales also rebounded strongly from the first-quarter low. One producer reported that sales in the last quarter 
were 50 percent higher than in the first quarter. A petrochemical 
producer reported that orders for chemical products rose 15 to 25 
percent since the trough earlier this year, and another expected 
that sales this quarter will exceed year-ago levels for the first 
time this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Production of major appliances was recovering slowly. One producer 
reported that output rose 6 percent in the last three months 
compared with the three preceding months, but further gains are 
heavily dependent upon a recovery in housing. Another appliance 
producer stated that production of most appliances was boosted about 
20 percent in recent months because of the best volume of orders in 
two years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comments from capital goods producers suggested that some recovery 
is under way, but from the very low levels of last spring. A major 
machine tool builder who reported that backlogs were cut by one-half over the past year also said that while orders were rising for 
the past several months, it will take many months of further 
improvement just to get back to the recession lows of 1960-1961. An 
economist with a heavy-duty truck producer also reported that orders 
were picking up from the low of early last spring and that he 
expects it may not be until well into 1977 before orders will 
recover to the peak levels of 1973-1974. A director with an office 
equipment producer reported business was below expectations, 
following very good months in May and June.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel orders and production, which were boosted in September by 
hedge-buying, sagged since then with little indication that 
improvement may come before next quarter. An economist with a major 
steel producer said that orders for November were up a little from a 
depressed October and that December order books were weak. Another 
steel economist stated steel inventory liquidation was cutting 
demand about four million tons this quarter and another two million 
tons next quarter. Production was expected to rise 15 to 20 percent 
next quarter as inventory liquidation nears completion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both economists reported that recent steel price increases were 
holding, despite weak steel markets. One commented that customers 
were not fighting for price concessions typical of past recessions 
because of concern over inadequate steel capacity that can only be 
increased by higher steel prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was still no indication of a sharp rebound in retail sales in 
this district. Automobile sales rose mildly since last spring, but 
the new 1976 models were not yet generating much consumer interest. 
In Cuyahoga County (Cleveland) a dealers association reported that 
sales in Octoberâ€”considered a weak monthâ€”rose 7 percent from a 
year earlier. A director with a bank in southwest Ohio reported that 
auto sales and financing picked up substantially in recent weeks, 
and another director reported some pressure from auto companies to 
extend loan maturities to 60 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       An economist with a national department store headquartered in the 
district reported that soft goods sales were improving since May and 
that unit sales of hard goods this quarter were expected to exceed 
year-earlier sales for the first time this year. A financial 
officer with another department store reported consumers were still 
cautious. Business at that store was boosted last month by an 
anniversary sale, but sales were less than expected. A large 
producer of soaps and detergents reported improvement in sales since 
late last summer, and further but moderate gains were expected in 
the fourth quarter. Some upgrading in consumer purchases of food 
since August was noted by the president of a large national grocery 
chain, but he remarked that consumers were selective, cautious, and 
bargain-hunting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Net deposits rebounded in October, and all savings and loan 
associations contacted reported that deposit inflows were excellent 
so far in November. Fears of disintermediation dissipated for the 
time being. An officer with one association reported a possible need 
to borrow in order to finance their aggressive lending policy, but 
two others reported liquidity was higher than desired. They 
commented that the supply of mortgage credit will probably exceed 
demand, at least until next spring. High mortgage rates have 
deterred some borrowers, according to two of our directors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Twenty-one economists associated with firms in the Fourth District 
indicated that between the fourth quarter of 1975 and the fourth 
quarter of 1976 real GNP will increase about $45 billion (5.5 
percent), industrial production will increase 8.5 percent, and the 
unemployment rate will ease from 8.2 to 7.5 percent. The group, 
which will meet at this Bank on November 14, expected the rate of 
inflation to rise by 5.9 percent in 1976. The vast majority of 
participants expected that gains in real GNP will be larger in the 
second half than in the first half of 1976.
