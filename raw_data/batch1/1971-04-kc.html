      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

     <p>
      <strong>
       April 6, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       A survey of Head Office and Branch Directors, and other area 
businessmen, suggests that economic conditions in the Tenth Federal 
Reserve District are improving somewhat. Yet there is recognition 
that any further unfavorable movements in the Nation's economy might 
cause a resumption in the economic problems of the District states. 
Business people in some District states feel that the economic slump 
reported for the rest of the Nation has not been as severe within 
their own areas. At the same time, one Director, who reports his 
state less hard hit by the recent economic slump than the Nation as 
a whole, feels that a continual bombardment of the local area with a 
national psychology of recession has made workers and consumers 
within the state more worried and cautious than they otherwise would 
be, and than may be warranted by the local economic situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The northern states of the District have continued to feel adverse 
weather conditions which have been reflected in slower improvement 
in business conditions than would normally be true for this season 
of the year. In general, the employment outlook seems to be one of 
some moderate growth in employment but not fast enough to wholly 
offset expected labor force increases. Thus near-term improvements 
in the overall unemployment rate within the District are expected to 
be modest, if apparent at all. District firms are trying to do a 
better job with fewer people on their payrolls and, at this point, 
seem to be using attrition rather than layoffs to keep the size of 
their work forces within bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction activity continues to be favorable but remains variable 
within the District. Residential construction is strong in Colorado, 
for example, but is reported by some Directors to be currently less 
strong in metropolitan areas of Oklahoma. A pickup in home-building 
in the Kansas City metropolitan area seems to be definitely under 
way since settlement of last year's construction strike, with 
builders starting to build speculatively again. A spokesman for the 
local homebuilders association suggests that the national figure of 
two million housing starts for the year seems perfectly possible, 
even likely, if the Kansas City area's present experience and 
expected performance is any indication. The housing mix in the 
Kansas City area seems to be distributed between single-and 
multiple-family dwellings about as it has been in the recent past. 
There also seems to be evidence of a tendency toward lower priced, 
smaller, new single-family houses with fewer frills, among new 
construction in the Kansas City area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Directors, themselves engaged in the construction industry, 
commented about labor market and labor relations conditions in that 
industry within the District. One Director reports that, with this 
year's construction activity in his area down from last year's 
better-than-average level, union employment in the area is down to 
its lowest level in years. This is already apparently making union 
labor somewhat less militant than before, in the sense that they are 
showing a willingness to work with nonunion workers on a job and do 
not press for union labor only. This should, in his opinion, keep 
costs of construction from rising as much as they might otherwise. 
He also feels that the President's action concerning the Davis-Bacon 
Act will have a restraining influence on construction cost 
increases, especially for construction jobs in smaller towns 
surrounding a major urban area. The second Director referred to 
above, who is from another state in the District, also sees some 
signs of a tempering of union wage demands in the construction 
industry. Some crafts in Oklahoma City, according to this Director, 
have recently settled for nominal increases compared with those of 
the recent past. These types of settlements have resulted because of 
an apparent feeling by the unions that they have been pricing their 
workers out of jobs. He feels that other crafts will not even aim so 
high as the settlement that has been recently completed. He sees no 
direct effects in this situation of the Davis-Bacon action but 
suggests that it is more likely to result from such things as fear 
of direct controls, the possible loss of jobs, and other factors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank loan demand, which was reported as weak in February, appears to 
have firmed up recently according to District bankers. With building 
activity picking up in the District, construction loans are showing 
considerable strength. Consumer installment loans also are reported 
to be showing some improvement. A mixed picture, however, is 
presented by business loans. Loan demand by some of the large 
national accounts continues to be weak. On the other hand, loan 
demand by locally based firms is said to be steady to moderately 
strong. Supporting evidence that overall loan demand in the District 
may be picking up somewhat is that a number of bankers report a 
marked increase in overline loan demands coming from their country 
correspondents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banks continue to experience strong deposit inflows in demand and 
time accounts considering seasonal factors. Rates paid by District 
banks on large CD's have declined in line with the New York market, 
while rates paid on consumer CD's and passbook savings have 
generally remained unchanged during the past month. In many 
instances, however, banks indicate that they are considering the 
possibility of lowering their time and savings rates. One bank 
reported that on its consumer CD's it was now computing interest on 
a quarterly basis instead of on a daily basis. Nonetheless, the 
prevailing attitude toward further reductions in time and savings 
rates is one of caution. Underlying this cautious attitude is the 
reluctance of bankers to discourage deposit inflows because they 
generally expect bank loan demand to improve gradually over the 
coming months.
