      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 13, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Fifth District appears to have picked up 
further in recent weeks, although there is as yet little evidence of 
any significant momentum in the recovery. The diffusion of responses 
in our latest survey of manufacturers suggests an increase in order 
backlogs for the first time in over a year, with further recent 
increases in new orders, shipments, and employment. Retailers report 
additional sales gains, although big-ticket items continue to move 
sluggishly relative to total sales. The inventory adjustment in the 
trade sector appears to have been completed, but manufacturers 
continue to pare down stocks of both materials and finished goods. 
Business loan demand at District banks appears to have increased 
lately, and consumer loans have definitely picked up. Meanwhile, the 
flow of time and savings deposits into banks and other thrift 
institutions has abated. Our latest survey shows a further 
significant improvement in business confidence. More than two thirds 
of the respondents now expect business conditions to improve both 
nationally and locally over the next six months.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Responses to the latest survey of District manufacturers show 
continued improvement in most areas of activity, but the improvement 
is by no means general. The latest increases in orders and shipments 
reflect, for the most part, growing strength in textiles, furniture, 
and a few other lines. Activity in the primary metals and machinery 
industries remains sluggish. While inventories of both materials and 
finished goods continue to decline, nearly half the respondents 
still view current levels as excessive. Employment in manufacturing 
has apparently improved significantly, and this has contributed to a 
general improvement in District labor market conditions. 
Manufacturing respondents reporting increases in employment 
outnumber those reporting decreases by two to one. State 
unemployment rates are continuing to fall as layoffs are terminated 
and new hires are resumed at a more normal rate. It now appears that 
unemployment has been declining since April or May. Survey 
respondents, as well as other District sources, also continue to 
report increases in the length of the workweek.
      </p>
      <p>
       The price picture has deteriorated lately. In the latest survey, a 
large number of manufacturers reported paying and receiving higher 
prices than have done so at any time this year. About one half paid 
and almost one third received higher prices. Meanwhile, almost one 
half report higher average hourly earnings by their employees.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing inventories remain well above desired levels. Over 40 
percent of the manufacturers surveyed view present inventory levels 
and current plant and equipment capacity as excessive. Nevertheless, 
an overwhelming majority felt current expansion plans are about 
right. Concerning the outlook for the next six months, almost three 
fourths of the respondents expect improvements in the level of 
production in their own firms as well as in the level of business 
activity nationally. Almost as many foresee an improvement in 
business activity in their respective market areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The July survey of District retailers shows little change from 
recent months. Sales continue to improve, but big-ticket items 
remain weak relative to total sales. Inventories at the retail level 
showed little change and are apparently at satisfactory levels 
despite the third consecutive month of improved sales. Employment at 
retail establishments was essentially unchanged. Price increases at 
the retail level seem to have resumed, and employee compensation is 
continuing to rise. Retailers seem to be satisfied with the current 
number and size of their outlets, although 60 percent expect 
business conditions to improve generally over the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fifth District bankers now anticipate that loan demand will soon 
begin to recover from its protracted decline. In recent weeks these 
expectations appear to have been realized, particularly in the 
consumer loan area. Commercial lending officers still see signs of a 
potential resurgence in business loan demand, but this potential has 
not fully shown up on bank ledgers. District banks are nonetheless 
preparing for this intensified demand by structuring their 
investment portfolios in favor of short-term securities. Commercial 
and industrial loans increased at an annual rate of over 9 percent 
in July, with working capital loans to the textile industry playing 
an important part in this increase. Bank real estate loans have not 
shown signs of recovery, and it appears that much of the increased 
activity in mortgage lending has been concentrated at savings and 
loan associations. Meanwhile, the flow of time deposits into 
District banks and other institutions dropped off significantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       District farmers' demand for both short- and long-term credit 
appears to have grown substantially during the first half of 1975. 
The volume of loans outstanding as of June 30 was 20 percent above a 
year ago at PCA's and 31 percent larger at the Federal Land Banks. 
With farm income estimates for the first quarter revised upward, the 
District's January-May cash receipts from farm marketings were only 
4 percent below a year earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       This season's flue-cured tobacco prices, by belts, are averaging 
from 3 to 7 percent below a year ago. Quality of the crop is lower 
than in 1974, yet leaf firms are apparently being more 
discriminating over quality tobacco. Tobacco growers, meanwhile, 
have a large investment in the 1975 crop, with production costs 
estimated to be at least 7 cents a pound greater than in 1974.
