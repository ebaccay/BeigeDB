     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall impression gained from opinions expressed by Federal 
Reserve Bank directors and business leaders was one of a somewhat 
sluggish economic recovery, with an upward drift in unemployment. 
The assessment was: further cutbacks, on balance, in planned capital 
outlays; with one notable exception, indications that consumer 
spending was still restrained; and, continued relatively strong 
upward pressures on prices. The directors felt current System policy 
to be about right and felt that further easing would be 
inappropriate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the directors felt that the tendency to cut back on plant 
and equipment spending is persisting. The
      <br/>
      vice-president of the 
largest corporation in Rochester indicated that his company's 
spending program was influenced by a large project already underway, 
and little could be done to cut back that project. However, he 
reported hearing of instances where planned spending was being 
deferred or cut back. Another director stated that while he had not 
seen any evidence of cutbacks in general, he believed they were 
occurring in certain special cases, notably the aerospace industry.
Responses were mixed among top officials of nationwide corporations 
regarding their plant and equipment plans. The president of one of
the nation's largest steel companies expected his firm's 1971 
outlays would be about the same as this year's, as against an 
originally planned increase of 25 percent, with the reduction to be 
implemented by deferments and "stretching out" rather than through 
cancellations. A diversified manufacturing corporation has budgeted 
a small increase in capital outlays for the next year, following 
"severe" cuts last year. Conversely, a large corporation in the 
financial services, aerospace and insurance fields has planned a 
sizable cut in such expenditures for the coming year after 
"abnormally high" outlays in the past two years. Several business 
leaders stressed the increasing importance of environmental control 
in their capital spending plans, and its adverse effect on 
productivity gains.
     </p>
     <p>
      The chairman of a Rochester department store characterized retail 
business in his area as "not too good." Consumers are not spending 
freely, partly as a result of higher unemployment. The president of 
a Buffalo bank noted that installment loans at his bank were at a 
somewhat lower level than last year. On the other hand, the 
president of an upstate bank reported a rise in such loans, 
particularly automobile paper. The chairman of a large medium-sized 
retail chain specializing in software was somewhat less optimistic 
than last month, when he had felt that consumer confidence had 
improved significantly and would soon be translated into increased 
retail sales. In the case of his firm, these hopes have not yet 
materialized. He still believed that "the corner had been turned", 
but that the recovery will be at a slower pace than he feels is 
generally expected. Among the factors he mentioned as currently 
inhibiting his own sales were the persisting—indeed intensified—confusion over fashion styles, and the warm weather for this time of 
the year. He also felt that the "ripples" of the General Motors 
strike were beginning to adversely affect sales—particularly in 
those areas where plants that were on strike, or laying off workers 
as a result of the strike, loomed large in the local economy. The 
one notable exception in this generally gloomy retail sales picture 
was provided by the president of a large New York City department 
store with several suburban branches. He reported that September had 
been a very good month for his firm and that business was "steadily 
improving on a broad front." The sale of hard goods, notably 
television sets, had picked up smartly, while in his view the 
confusion over fashion styles was being rapidly clarified, with a 
concomitant improvement in apparel sales. He expected sales during 
the coming Christmas season to reach a record high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most of the directors indicated that the somewhat less rapid rise in 
prices in recent months should probably be regarded as temporary. 
The chairman of the nationwide manufacturing concern noted that 
there were still some big price increases to come, for example, in 
the automobile industry. The president of an upstate bank observed 
that "if wages go up 8-10 percent per annum, how can higher prices 
be avoided?" Several other directors as well as other business 
leaders also commented on the continued upward pressures generated 
by higher labor costs. The Federal Reserve Bank directors, both at 
the head office and at the Buffalo branch, generally regarded 
current monetary policy as correct and felt that further easing at 
this time would be inappropriate.
