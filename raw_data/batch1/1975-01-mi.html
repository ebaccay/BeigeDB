      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 15, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the recent weeks the spreading slowdown in the national economy 
  has increasingly affected the District. Labor market conditions have 
  softened, and District employers are laying off workers. Retail 
  sales gains in December were below those reported earlier in the 
  year, despite sizable sales increases just before Christmas. Price 
  cutting has made District retailers concerned about their profit 
  margins and cautious about the 1975 outlook. Savings inflows have 
  improved in the District, but no immediate increase in home building 
  is foreseen since savings and loan associations are using these 
  funds to improve liquidity rather than to expand lending operations. 
  One encouraging factor, however, is that District farmers should 
  benefit from high prices, at least through the first half of the 
  year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the District has not experienced the sizable layoffs 
  reported nationally, job opportunities are shrinking. Recently, the 
  number of job orders to state employment offices in the Twin Cities 
  metropolitan area has declined noticeably. Help-wanted advertising 
  in the District has also been dropping since August. Three of the 
  District's largest manufacturers have reported some work-force 
  reductions. A large computer manufacturer, headquartered in the Twin 
  Cities, announced that declining business forced it to reduce 
  operations in the last half of 1974, and further reductions in the 
  first quarter of 1975 are planned.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three other District computer manufacturers recently announced that 
  they were also curbing operations. Also, District manufacturers of 
  home-building supplies and television components have let workers 
  go. The slump in auto production is beginning to be felt in the 
  District, and several manufacturers of auto components have had to 
  lay off workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent District retail sales also reflected a letup in economic 
  activity. Retailers surveyed by this Bank indicate that their sales 
  had been running around 10 percent ahead of a year ago until about 
  mid-November when sales deteriorated markedly. In December, most 
  reported sales increases of only about 5 percent, despite very 
  strong sales gains Christmas week. However, since December's gains 
  in many instances were achieved by price cutting, several retailers 
  expressed concern about their earnings. District automobile sales 
  also weakened during the final months of 1974. Resort owners in the 
  District reported that neither the dollar volume of business nor 
  attendance increased as much as through the fall of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      With regard to 1975, District retailers were cautious. One 
  respondent indicated that the large number of people taking 
  advantage of Christmas sales may have hurt his firm's January 
  business; another described his business so far this year as "lousy". Still another termed his early January business as 
  encouraging but indicated that warmer than normal weather through 
  December and early January had adversely affected the sales of some 
  seasonal merchandise. Retailers are apparently cutting down 
  inventories and trying to be as liquid as possible in order to take 
  advantage of buys later in the year. Regional automobile sales 
  offices, responding to a survey last month, were 
  uncharacteristically conservative in their 1975 outlook.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings inflows to District savings and loan associations improved 
  in the final months of 1975, but no immediate improvement in home 
  building is foreseen. Loan commitments have not yet increased and 
  will probably not rise significantly during the first quarter of 
  1975. One reason is that savings and loan associations have had to 
  reduce their large volume of borrowing and increase their liquid 
  assets before expanding their lending operations. However, there was 
  a slight easing in interest rates on Government-insured mortgages in 
  the final months of 1974.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agriculture helped insulate the District from the downturn of the 
  national economy last year, and many District farmers are starting 
  1975 in a generally good financial condition. Conditions in the 
  livestock sector exerted somewhat of a drag on last year's farm 
  income, and weather conditions cut crop yields. But higher prices 
  offset the short-fall in crops, and cash farm receipts for last year 
  are expected to be up slightly from a year earlier. Consequently, 
  District farmers with crops to sell at the beginning of 1975 are in 
  a strong cash flow position.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop prices are expected to remain good at least through the first 
  half of 1975 for several reasons: Supplies are tight, domestic 
  demand remains strong, export buying is good, and farmers have been 
  holding crops, hoping to obtain higher returns.
