      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The decline in industrial output in the district appears to have 
  bottomed out. The Texas Industrial Production Index, after falling 
  throughout the first quarter, has turned up. The primary reason for 
  the upturn is that many firms had liquidated their inventories to 
  such low levels that increased production was needed to maintain 
  minimal levels of stocks. Petroleum refiners, for example, allowed 
  stocks of gasoline and heating oil to run off in the first quarter 
  of the year before increasing operations. Garment makers have 
  stepped up production in response to a recent influx of orders from 
  large chains and department stores that placed virtually no bookings 
  in the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Textile producers also report increased orders but mention that the 
  industry's profit margins are being squeezed. Escalating electricity 
  rates are boosting production costs, and manufacturers consider the 
  market for their goods still too weak to pass on the bulk of the 
  higher energy charges to customers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output of construction materials has leveled off after 12 months of 
  decline. Shipments by the district's largest manufacturer of 
  reinforcing steel bars, for example, have stabilized at roughly half 
  the year-earlier level, but a company official maintains the firm 
  is facing a severe cost squeeze. A buildup of inventories in the 
  second half of 1974 forced prices of finished goods down a third 
  from peak levels late last year. Meanwhile, production costs have 
  continued to climb and are the highest in the company's history.
     </p>
     <p>
      Producers of oil field equipment report plants are still operating 
  at full capacity. However, future production appears to be 
  threatened. Bookings have fallen sharply in the past two months, and 
  many orders have been canceled. Producers trace the softening in 
  demand to the suspension of the oil depletion allowance and to the 
  government's delay in drawing up a definitive energy policy. A 
  manufacturer of offshore drilling rigs reports recent cancellations 
  will probably force layoffs at a plant in east Texas. Producers of 
  oil field pipe have experienced a reduction in new orders as major 
  oil companies are building inventories cautiously, in contrast to 
  last year when they frantically stockpiled pipe.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel companies supplying the petroleum industry also report a 
  reduction in orders. An official at one steel mill in Houston says 
  his company, which operated under a deluge of orders in 1974, will 
  have filled its backlog of unfilled orders by midyear.
     </p>
     <p>
      The boom in drilling activity in Texas that prevailed during 1974 is 
  showing signs of easing. Drilling in the state has dipped slightly 
  below peak levels in the first quarter but remains higher than a 
  year earlier. Wet weather has hampered drilling operations somewhat 
  by limiting the mobility of large equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recent legislation that increased taxes for oil companies is likely 
  to further dampen drilling. Major companies and large independents, 
  having lost their depletion allowance, are reexamining their 
  exploration budgets. Some signs that the new laws are already 
  adversely impacting on drilling have emerged. Drilling rigs, in 
  tight supply in 1974, are more readily available. Moreover, drilling 
  contractors report lead time for projects has been reduced. The full 
  impact of the increase in taxes, however, will not be seen for 
  several months. Exploratory drilling, which involves heavy financial 
  risks, will be harder hit than development drilling, which increases 
  the number of wells in proven oil fields. But even with the 
  anticipated slowdown, the current backlog of commitments will keep 
  overall drilling high in 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rate of net savings inflows at district S&amp;Ls, which accelerated 
  in the fourth quarter of 1974, has continued strong in 1975. The 
  composition of these deposits differs from recent years, as a larger 
  portion are passbook savings. The largest S&amp;L in Houston, for 
  example, reports passbook accounts now make up a third of its total 
  deposits. Normally, passbook deposits account for a fifth of its 
  savings accounts. In recent weeks, this trend has accelerated by a 
  large influx of income tax rebate checks. However, S&amp;L officials 
  believe most of these savings are earmarked for summer expenditures, 
  such as vacations. Withdrawals of passbook savings are not expected 
  to strain the liquidity positions of the S&amp;Ls, since the inflow of 
  large depositsâ€”$l00, 000 and overâ€”has been great enough to offset 
  large-scale withdrawals from the smaller accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite having ample funds, lenders have been reluctant to lower 
  rates on mortgage loans because the cost of funds remains high and 
  is not expected to decline. Prevailing rates on 80 percent 
  conventional mortgages at S&amp;Ls in the district range from 9 to 9.5 
  percent. These high interest rates have contributed to continued 
  sluggishness in loan demand, providing little incentive to 
  homebuilders to step up construction activity. Residential building 
  in the district is only slightly higher than the low point early 
  this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      First year wage increases negotiated in the construction industry 
  this spring in district cities ranged from 6 to 13 percent. In a few 
  citiesâ€”El Paso for oneâ€”settlements followed strikes by union 
  locals. Wage settlements might have been higher, but the depressed 
  level of building activity helped to hold down the increases. 
  Settlements were larger where there were major industrial or public 
  construction projects under way and in those areas where large 
  national contractors were operating. In Houston, for example, 
  contractors report that the building crafts won increases of 10 to 
  11 percent, only slightly less than the 12 percent won last year. 
  Important factors in the settlement were the extraordinary amount of 
  work under way, especially industrial projects, and the large 
  concentration of national contractors in the city.
