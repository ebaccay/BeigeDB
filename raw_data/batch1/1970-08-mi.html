      Ninth District business economists feel that the national economy is 
turning around and that a pickup in consumer spending will lead to 
improved business conditions during the latter part of 1970. A 
vigorous recovery, however, is not anticipated, and the rate of 
inflation is not expected to slow appreciably. Although they do not 
foresee large increases, reports from bank directors and officers 
reveal that District retailers expect their sales to improve during 
the second half of the year. Manufacturing sales, on the other hand, 
are expected to continue sluggish. Corporate profits in the District 
have suffered and Ninth District firms are cutting costs in order to 
restore earnings. Recent large wage concessions to construction 
workers and Teamsters are impeding efforts to cut labor costs. 
Several cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were reported in 
the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      The consensus of opinion among local business economists is that the 
economy is turning around and business conditions will improve 
during the latter half of 1970. They do not, however, expect a 
vigorous recovery, and one economist described the current slowdown 
and expected recovery as being saucer shaped. He said that the 
current slowdown has not been as rapid or deep as in earlier post-World War II downturns and that the recovery will not be as sharp as 
in previous upturns. The rate of inflation is not expected to slow 
appreciably and interest rates are not expected to fall 
significantly before the end of the year. They also look for 
businessmen to continue to revise downward their capital spending 
plans this year. A major Minneapolis scientific instrument and 
ordnance manufacturer, for example, reduced its original increase in 
capital spending plans by 20 per cent. These economists do not think 
that total Government spending will change noticeably. Consequently 
they see the stimulus for recovery coming from consumer spending. A 
business economist representing a national retailer felt that 
consumer confidence would be recovered during the last half of the 
year. He also stated that consumers financially are in better shape 
than in previous downturns and it will be easier for them to resume 
spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      In spite of their relatively optimistic outlook, they felt that the 
economy was not out of the woods yet. One economist, for example, 
stated that another "Penn Central" could have a disastrous effect on 
business activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from bank directors and officers confirm local business 
economists' expectations that retail sales will improve during the 
second half of the year. They do not look for an unusually large 
increase in retail sales, but they do expect it to be better than 
during the first half. Women's apparel and automobile sales are big 
unknowns. Reports disclose that a major Minneapolis retailer is 
having trouble selling midi-length styles. A report from one 
director indicates that consumers are buying cars now to avoid the 
price increases on 1971 models this Fall. District manufacturers 
responding to our latest industrial expectations survey feel that 
the rate of advance in District manufacturing sales will continue 
sluggish during the remainder of 1970.
     </p>
     <p>
      In responding to a question on corporate profits, bank directors and 
officers indicated that profits in the Ninth District suffered or at 
best held steady during the second quarter, although there were 
notable exceptions. In response to this situation numerous examples 
of cost cutting were cited. An economist for a large national 
manufacturer stated that attitudes have changed in his company on 
what constitutes a necessary cost. One large brewery in the Twin 
Cities cut its current advertising budget by $800,000. District 
employers have curtailed their utilization of labor through layoffs 
and overtime reductions, and a large Minneapolis computer 
manufacturer instructed each employee to take ten days of unpaid 
vacation before the end of the year. Cost cutting is also 
manifesting itself in reductions in capital spending and inventory 
cutbacks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although reports indicate District businessmen are trying to cut 
inventories, several cases of unwanted inventory accumulation were 
reported. One large Twin City manufacturer's inventory increased 
because of overly optimistic sales projections. Reports reveal that 
the large retailers and a national mail order house have accumulated 
inventories because of the trucking strike. They are receiving this 
summer' s seasonal merchandise late and are being forced to cut its 
price to avoid carrying it over.
     </p>
     <p>
      One factor, however, that will impede cost cutting efforts by 
District businessmen is the recent large wage concessions granted to 
the construction workers and Teamsters. As a result of these 
settlements, bank directors indicate that unions in their areas are 
becoming very aggressive in their wage demands, making the 
settlement of some current negotiations difficult. One director 
reports that construction companies are cutting overtime because of 
the large wage settlements.
