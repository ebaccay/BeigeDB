      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy continues to recover smartly, according to Second 
  District Directors and other business leaders who were contacted 
  recently. Significant further growth in GNP is expected over the 
  coming year; consumer spending for the most part remains buoyant; 
  residential construction is beginning to recover in the District; 
  and there continue to be expectations of a turnaround in capital 
  goods outlays. Nevertheless, some apprehensions have been voiced 
  about potential future shortages of steel and other metals. Against 
  this background, prices are expected to begin rising more rapidly 
  and forthcoming wage negotiations to result in substantial 
  settlements.
     </p>
     <p>
      All of the respondents expressing an opinion on the subject felt 
  that a brisk economic recovery would be sustained over the balance 
  of the year. Several noted that the economy had performed better 
  during the first quarter than they had expected. Among others, the 
  chairman of a multinational chemical corporation expected the 
  upswing to continue to gather strength from greater than anticipated 
  consumer demand. A Director associated with the automotive industry 
  reported that, on the basis of recent domestic auto sales, he had 
  raised his expectations for real GNP growth for 1976 from 6 to 7 
  percent. The president of a large metal producing firm reported that 
  demand for metals was increasing somewhat faster than had been 
  expected earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest survey of the Buffalo Purchasing Management Association 
  points to further significant improvement in the demand for locally 
  produced goods, with virtually all respondents reporting a steady or 
  increased flow of new orders, and nearly half reporting an 
  improvement in the volume of new orders, as compared to only 13 
  percent so reporting a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      As in previous months, consumer spending generally continued to be 
  characterized as strong. The Buffalo Branch Directors reported that 
  retail sales over the Easter shopping period had been "very strong," 
  and good gains were also posted in suburban areas of the New York 
  City region. Some slowing in early May in the rate of growth of 
  department store sales in the Buffalo area as compared to last year 
  was noted, but this was attributed in good part to the spurt in 
  consumer outlays during the comparable period last year under the 
  impact of the tax rebates. In any event, this softening was not 
  apparent in the Rochester area. Moreover, a number of respondents 
  reported the demand for automobiles in upstate New York continuing 
  very strong, with some dealers having depleted inventories of 
  certain models. The retail sales picture in New York City, however, 
  was less favorable. April sales of large city department stores,
  notwithstanding the later Easter this year, registered a 
  disappointing advance of only 3.3 percent from the year-earlier 
  level—less than the rise in general merchandise prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      While retail sales and the more recent rebuilding of business 
  inventories continued to provide the main thrust to the recovery, 
  there were further indications that the hitherto lagging capital 
  investment and residential construction sectors might be picking up. 
  A financial economist thus felt that even the 4 percent increase in 
  real business plant and equipment spending in 1976 implied by the 
  latest McGraw-Hill survey was too low. In his view, a rise of nearly 
  6 percent was probably more appropriate. Several other financial 
  economists reiterated their expectations that capital outlays would 
  pick up as the recovery proceeded. The residential construction 
  picture continues to brighten in most parts of the District, with 
  the notable exception of New York City. An official of a New York 
  State thrift trade association reported that mortgage money was in 
  substantially greater availability than last fall, and that even 90 
  percent mortgages were now being made in certain suburban areas 
  surrounding New York City and Buffalo. The Buffalo Branch Directors 
  reported that there was clear evidence of an upswing in housing 
  construction in western New York. The improvement has been 
  particularly apparent in prime suburban areas, but has also been 
  evident in the low-to-moderate priced residential sector. Apartment 
  construction remains in the doldrums, however, under the influence 
  of high vacancy rates in some areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding the price outlook, the official of the chemical concern 
  mentioned above expected the rate of increase in wholesale prices to 
  approach a 7-8 percent range by year-end, and expressed concern over 
  the prospects of shortages in steel and certain other metals. The 
  latter concern was also expressed by some other respondents. A 
  Director noted the sharp increase in metals prices which he felt 
  might reflect some speculation, but also the fact that in his view 
  profit margins remain very low in most basic commodities. A Director 
  associated with agriculture stated that he was not as optimistic as 
  the Department of Agriculture regarding the 1976 grain harvest and 
  that, in his opinion, higher grain prices are in the offing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another Director expressed the view that it appeared unlikely that 
  the underlying rate of inflation could be kept down below 6 percent 
  given the present state of consumer demand, fiscal policies, and of 
  wage pressures. In the latter context, a number of Directors 
  expected fairly strong wage demands from organized labor, with 
  first-year settlements ranging from 8 to 10 percent in union 
  contracts and with non-union wage increases lagging only slightly 
  behind.
