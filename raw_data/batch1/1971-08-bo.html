       August 18, 1971
      </strong>

      <p>
       The economic recovery appears to be very weak in most business 
areas, but especially in the capital goods industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of our directors reported no change from the sluggish business 
outlook that they had reported last month. Industries like precision 
bearings, superalloys, and machine tools which are tied to 
investment spending are still very weak, backlogs are shrinking and 
new orders are either not higher or only slightly higher than a year 
ago. Similarly, military aerospace orders are declining as are 
backlogs. Orders for commercial aircraft engines are also being 
stretched out or in some cases canceled. Products connected with the 
housing industry, like gas meters, are doing very well. The 
settlement of construction labor contracts has also opened up 
business for a supplier in the nonresidential building market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer sales continue to be the best business area.
       <br/>
       A conglomerate 
manufacturer of a large variety of consumer goods reports sales up 
10 to 11 percent from last year. Products for the home sewing market 
are particularly strong. As a result of rising sales volume, 
inventories are being allowed to rise. Of all the directors spoken 
to, this was the only indication of an easier inventory policy. And 
even this director stated that in other lines of his business, 
inventories were being kept at low levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the moderate rate of domestic auto sales, tire sales are 
doing very well as a result of a good pickup in demand for 
replacement tires and production of the 1972 models. This supplier 
to the auto industry was the only director to mention that business 
had been affected by the rail strikes in July. Lack of supplies 
caused his company to close 3 of its 6 plants for up to a week at 
the end of July.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another pessimistic note for domestic auto sales: a Ford dealer in 
our district, who had the second largest sales of any Ford dealer in 
the nation, gave up his franchise in July because "he saw the 
handwriting on the wall" for domestic autos.
      </p>
      <p>
       A bank director reported that while the bank is flush with deposits—a 20 percent gain over last year—the only demand for funds is for 
mortgages. Both business and consumer installment lending is very 
sluggish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of our academic respondents, only Paul Samuelson and Eli Shapiro 
were available for interviews before the President's speech. 
According to Professor Samuelson, the most discouraging aspect of 
the present economic situation was the stubbornness of, almost the 
re-ignition of, the cost-push, administered price inflation. 
Samuelson emphasized strongly that it was a seller's inflation, not 
associated with a too rapid growth of real output. Some kind of 
incomes policy was urgently needed. "Whatever it is, I'm for it." 
Eli Shapiro was opposed to the President's doing more than his 
recent increased willingness to jawbone by periodically showing his 
alarm. To do more, he argued, is administratively too difficult to 
be effective. On inflation, Shapiro viewed the evidence as extremely 
mixed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Samuelson described the behavior of real output as "anemic." He 
expected its future path to run at or below the "fashionable 
forecasts." He found some encouragement in the 5.8 percent July 
unemployment figure, but was worried about the effect of the steel 
layoffs on the August rate. Shapiro attached little importance to 
the July figure. Anticipating a "good" fourth quarter, he expected 
unemployment to peak in the third quarter. By a good fourth quarter, 
he explained, he meant a real growth rate of at least 4 percent and 
perhaps
       <br/>
       as high as 5 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shapiro believed monetary growth rates of 10 to 11 percent ran a 
substantial risk of encouraging inflation. He advocated moving in 
the direction of a 6 percent rate of growth. Feeling no need for 
additional monetary or fiscal stimulus, Shapiro's basic policy 
position was to give the present policy course a little more time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although we tried to contact all our respondents again after the 
President's talk, only Samuelson, Shapiro and one bank director were 
available to comment on the President's new economic policies. The 
bank director felt the President's policies were "exciting and 
radical." He hoped that the meetings in September would turn into 
another Bretton Woods and that a new international monetary system 
would emerge which would 1) control Eurodollar movements and 2) not 
entail a return to gold. He foresaw some difficulty in administering 
rates for non-prime rate borrowers but concluded that the controls 
must be supported and made to work because this is the only policy 
we have left to fight inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The response of monetary authorities to the Administration's new 
economic plans should be analogous to what it was during the Penn 
Central crisis, Professor Samuelson said. Their role must be to 
assure everybody that there will be no credit, and no quality of 
credit, crisis. For the immediate future, the next 90 days to six 
months, the aim of a 6 percent rate of growth in monetary aggregates 
may be appropriate, though the Fed should not be preoccupied with 
any fixed figure and should be prepared to go to 8 to 11 percent. 
Samuelson noted that the flexibility of exchange rates creates new 
freedom for interest rates and that the housing market may benefit 
in the future from the new freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shapiro emphasized the announcement effects of the recent 
Presidential actions: the wage-price freeze, "the firmest form of 
jawboning," would help to break inflationary expectations, inducing 
more consumption out of a given level of spendable income; the tax 
reductions and import tax will stimulate auto sales and business 
fixed investment, while discouraging imports; and the suspension of 
convertibility is "a measure of our earnestness" that this 
Administration is tired of debating the adjustment process and 
reform must occur in September. He anticipated that the dollar will 
open at a discount but will recover and that some form of wage-price 
regulations must persist through the summer of 1972. The new 
stimulus reconfirmed Shapiro's earlier view that the Federal Reserve 
can move toward a 6 percent growth rate in the money supply.
