      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists who attended the June meeting of the Fourth District 
  Round Table at this Bank forecast more improvement in output, 
  prices, and employment in 1976 than they did at a similar meeting 
  last March. Several retailers and directors remain optimistic and 
  have not yet lowered their sales forecasts, although another month 
  of declining sales may bring about this result. Reports on key 
  industries in the District suggest ample capacity for most 
  industries during 1976 and 1977, but supplies have been tightening 
  in steel, rubber, and chemicals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists who attended the recent meeting at this Bank raised their 
  forecasts of output and lowered their estimates of inflation and 
  unemployment in 1976. The median forecast of real GNP for 1976 was 
  revised to 6.6 percent from 6.2 percent in March, the GNP price 
  deflator was revised to 5.3 percent from 6.0 percent, and the 
  unemployment rate was lowered to 7.3 percent from 7.6 percent. The 
  median forecast of the group also showed considerable slowing in the 
  rate of recovery from the first quarter. Recovery in business fixed 
  investment during the second half of the year is still not expected 
  to be much stronger than during the first half. Some members were 
  skeptical over projected gains in personal consumption expenditures 
  because of the recent drop in retail sales. However, all eight 
  economists who submitted auto sales forecasts raised their estimates 
  for the March meeting, with the median forecast at 10.3 million 
  units for 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers still appear optimistic that sales will rebound despite 
  the drop since April. A director with a national retail chain 
  headquartered in the District commented that retail inventories are 
  huge. He fears a continued drop in consumer spending may trigger a 
  double bottom recession, such as in 1957-1958. An economist with a 
  retail chain reported its sales have declined for the last seven 
  weeks, an unusually long period. Declines were largely in apparel 
  and appliances, but sales of carpeting, draperies, and housewares 
  were sustained through May. He speculates that abnormal weather and 
  smaller tax refunds in 1976 compared to 1975 account for the 
  unexpected decline in sales. Other retailers and producers of 
  consumer goods remain optimistic. A director associated with home 
  remodeling and modernization materials commented that demand is 
  still strong and that its plants in Ohio are still operating seven 
  days a week for the first time in five years. Another director 
  reported his company's consumer business is still good, that 
  capacity will be increased about 15 percent this year, and that it 
  is advancing its planned expansion for plastic housewares from next 
  year to this. The chairman of a large department store commented 
  that sales leveled off to a rational and sustainable level. Finally, 
  a major discount chain reported that sales in the last two weeks 
  picked up, following a decline that began in mid-April. It expects 
  the pickup to continue, although at a less vigorous rate than in the 
  first four months of 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      &gt;Manufacturing capacity is expected to be ample to accommodate 
  projected increases in output during 1976 and 1977, according to 
  reports from directors, financial officers, and economists in the 
  District. Shortages, such as experienced during 1973 and 1974, are 
  not likely to surface, although tight supplies will again mark some 
  key industries, especially steel, rubber, and chemicals. 
  Metalworking industries, which recently were operating at an 
  estimated 75 percent of capacity, are not expected to reach the 
  October 1973 peak for another two and one-half years, according to 
  an economist associated with a major durable goods producer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel is one industry where supplies have tightened, lead times have 
  lengthened, and operations have rebounded close to desired levels of 
  capacity. Steel operations, which rose from 80 percent utilization 
  in the first quarter of 1976 to 90 percent in May, are expected to 
  hover around 90 percent by year-end, according to several steel 
  economists. The industry should have about 159 million tons of 
  capacity available by the end of this year, compared with 153 
  million tons in 1975. Flat-roll products are in very tight supply, 
  but structural steel, plates, and line pipe are in ample supply. 
  Steel economists expect supply conditions for a broad range of 
  products to tighten by early 1977, as the industry operates close to 
  capacity. One economist expects steel shipments at 105 million tons 
  in 1977, compared with 110 million tons of finished steel capacity. 
  A director who is a raw material supplier to the steel industry 
  states that capacity limitations in steel stem from tight supplies 
  of raw materials, such as ore, and that steel producers will sharply 
  step up expansion of mining and materials facilities. A director 
  with a steel company agrees that capacity problems in steel lie in 
  basic raw materials.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tire producers are likely to operate at capacity for 12 to 15 months 
  after a labor settlement in the rubber industry, according to an 
  economist with a major tire producer. Operations last quarter were 
  at about 90 percent of capacity, in contrast to a recent low of 65 
  to 70 percent in the first quarter of 1975. Prior to the strike, 
  spot shortages of truck tires and radial tires for passenger cars 
  surfaced. The industry has adequate capacity for passenger car tires 
  until 1980, but capacity for truck tires is reported to be tight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Petrochemical producers in the District expect adequate capacity of 
  feedstocks to produce chemicals for 1976 and 1977. Demand for 
  petrochemicals in 1976 will approach or surpass record levels of 
  1973 and 1974, and supplies are expected to be adequate to meet 
  demand. Demand for plastics has rebounded sharply over the past 
  year. Polyvinyl chloride sales in 1976 are estimated at about 10 
  percent below peak levels in 1974. Plastics producers were operating 
  at about 80 percent of capacity last quarter and expect to be in an 
  80- to 85-percent range during 1977. One industry economist noted 
  that capacity for polyvinyl chloride rose about 30 percent between 
  January 1974 and January 1976, but effective capacity rose only 20 
  percent because of OSHA restrictions. Analysts expect that the 
  industry has adequate capacity through 1978.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sources associated with energy producers in the District—oil and 
  coal—foresee little problem meeting anticipated demands for their 
  products over the near term. An oil economist commented that there 
  are no shortages of oil but expressed concern about the increasing 
  U. S. dependence on foreign sources of crude oil. His estimates show 
  crude oil demand is likely to increase 5.5 percent from last year (7 
  percent if growth in the economy exceeds the standard forecast). The 
  industry can accommodate an 8-percent increase in gasoline demand in 
  1976, but supplies, although adequate, will tighten, especially for 
  lead-free gasoline. Refineries are operating at 86 percent of 
  capacity and should remain in the high 80's for the balance of 1976. 
  Crude capacity by year-end 1976 will be increased about 1 million 
  barrels from the end of 1972, but not much additional capacity is 
  scheduled for 1977. For the longer term, capacity expansion plans 
  are uncertain because of high costs of refining crude oil and 
  stringent Federal regulations that have had the effect of reducing 
  rig activity in the U. S. in recent months. Capacity for producing 
  coal is more than ample, at least for the short run. The industry is 
  now operating at about 10 percent below its desired rate. Capacity 
  is expected to increase from 740 million tons in 1976 to 880 million 
  tons in 1981, with half of the growth to come from low sulfur coal 
  in western states. This predicted growth in capacity assumes that 
  the industry can meet environmental standards.
     </p>
     <p>
      Other industries for which capacity appears to be more than ample 
  are aluminum, automotive, and metalworking. An economist with a 
  major aluminum producer reports that its projections indicate output 
  is not likely to reach capacity before 1979 or 1980, if then. 
  Operations by year-end are expected at about 84 percent, compared 
  with 80 percent currently. The only bottlenecks that may surface are 
  in sheet rolling capacity and in melting capacity, the latter due to 
  OSHA and pollution controls. Similarly, the auto industry is 
  currently operating at about 80 to 85 percent of capacity, about 10 
  percent below optimum levels. Finally, there is ample capacity in 
  metalworking industries, according to an economist associated with 
  the industry. Utilization is projected to be 80 to 85 percent of 
  capacity in 1976 and 1977.
