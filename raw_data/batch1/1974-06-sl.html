      Beige Book Report: St Louis

       June 12, 1974
      </strong>

       Economic activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District has 
continued moderately upward in recent weeks. Retail sales have 
increased on a seasonally adjusted basis; and manufacturing 
activity, with the exception of automobiles, is generally at full 
capacity. Construction is at a standstill in St. Louis as a result 
of a strike, and residential construction has slowed throughout the 
District. Total employment is down slightly, but the unemployment 
rate is relatively low. Inflation and supply shortages remain a 
major concern of businessmen in the area. Bankers report that growth 
of loan demand has slowed and bankruptcies are up. Farming 
conditions are mixed. Livestock feeders are losing money, but most 
crop prices remain at profitable levels for producers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales in the Eighth Federal Reserve District have generally 
continued upward in recent weeks. A representative of a major St. 
Louis department store reported that sales of all major lines except 
women's fashions had increased on a seasonally adjusted basis. Sales 
increases were also reported by businessmen in Arkansas, 
Mississippi, and West Tennessee; however, some slowdown in the rate 
of consumer purchases may have occurred in Louisville. Sales of 
appliances, however, were reported to be holding up surprisingly 
well in Louisville and St. Louis, in view of the decline in housing 
construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing activity in the District is continuing at full 
capacity with the exception of automobile production. Two of the 
major automobile assembly plants in the St. Louis area have laid off 
one shift each, or roughly one-third of their work force, and a 
third plant has laid off a few workers. Most other manufacturers 
report that backlogs of orders still exist for most types of capital 
equipment. There has been some slowing in demand for certain types 
of appliances, primarily of the gas burning type; however, the 
decline was more than offset by gains in other appliance sales. 
Demand for home freezers is especially high, reflecting the larger 
number of home gardens in urban areas and plans for freezing the 
vegetable crop. With the slower rate of home building and automobile 
output, demand for plastics and fibers is down; and even though raw 
material sources for such products, largely petroleum, have become 
scarcer, the upward price pressures have been less than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction has slowed in most of the District, and, in 
St. Louis, it has come to a standstill as a result of a strike by 
the construction workers. Single-family housing is also reported to 
be at a standstill in Memphis and falling off in Louisville and 
Little Rock.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial construction is spotty. It has been halted by the strike 
in St. Louis, but in other parts of the District it varies from slow 
to moderate, being retarded in some communities by shortages of 
equipment and materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latest available data indicate a slight decrease in total 
employment in most Eighth District states compared to the beginning 
of the year. The unemployment rate was unchanged in April from the 
previous month and remains below the national average of 5 percent. 
In Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee, the unemployment rate is 
below 4 percent. In the Eighth District SMSA's, it ranged from 2.7 
percent in Little Rock to 5.7 percent in St. Louis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inflation remains a major concern of Eighth District businessmen. 
Suppliers of many items are reported to be wary of quoting a price 
of future delivery. A major manufacturer in Louisville reported that 
materials costs have skyrocketed, largely reflecting shortages in 
steel and plastics. A Louisville brewery representative reported 
that increased costs of supplies and inability to raise selling 
prices were major problems. He reported a 72-percent increase in the 
cost of barley malt since the first of the year and an 82-percent 
increase in the cost of corn since last year. A Little Rock 
businessman reported that roofing asphalt has risen 56 percent this 
year and that benzene has risen tenfold since 1973. Complaints of 
high fertilizer prices continue. An Arkansas businessman viewed with
alarm our decision-making process which allows the money supply to 
increase while inflation is accelerating.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were a number of comments, however, to the effect that the 
rate of inflation may be subsiding. A St. Louis businessman reported 
that a number of formerly scarce items were becoming more available 
and that people are beginning to back away from panic buying. An oil 
industry representative reported that the price of crude oil has 
fallen back from winter levels and that more gasoline has come on 
the market in the last two weeks. He expects a stabilization of 
gasoline prices this summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand at major Eighth District financial centers may have 
reached a plateau. Total loans at the major banks showed very little 
change from April to May. Demand deposits have continued sharply 
upward in recent weeks, but other deposits have remained fairly 
stable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The savings and loan associations reported large inflows of funds; 
however, outflows were often greater than the inflows, as the 7 1/2-percent certificates are not being renewed. Holders of these 
certificates are investing their savings in higher-yielding assets. 
Bankers reported that bankruptcies and delinquencies are the highest 
in several years. Some bankers associate this problem with the labor 
stoppages, but delinquencies also seem to be a problem in areas that 
have not experienced severe strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The agricultural situation varies from good to bad, depending on the 
type of farm production involved. All feeders of animals have lost 
money in recent weeks. Beef cattle feeders have probably suffered 
the worst losses. Some are believed to have lost as much as $100 per 
cow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crop planting got off to an excellent start in most of the District, 
but, in recent weeks, planting has been slowed because of excessive 
rainfall, especially in Illinois and Indiana. If farmers are further 
delayed in planting corn, they will be forced to switch to faster-maturing, lower-yielding varieties or to some other crop. Most crop 
prices remain favorable to producers, providing incentive for 
sizable output increases over the 1973 crop.
