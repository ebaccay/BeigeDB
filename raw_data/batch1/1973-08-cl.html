      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 10, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Comments from our directors, businessmen, and economists indicate 
that the pace of business activity remains at a very high level. 
There are, however, numerous reports of distortions, including 
complaints of production bottlenecks stemming from capacity 
constraints and labor and materials shortages. A major retailing 
firm expects consumer spending to slow appreciably in the year 
ahead. In the financial area, some savings and loan associations in 
the District are experiencing heavy deposit losses as a result of 
interest rate differentials.
     </p>
     <p>
      The comments of our industrial directors at a board meeting held on 
August 9 indicate that the pace of business activity remains strong, 
but shortages of certain raw materials, particularly in the chemical 
area, are becoming an increasing problem. Two directors, whose firms 
are important producers of consumer goods, reported that, while 
orders remain strong, shortages of raw materials are impeding 
production. One of these indicated that about 10 percent of the 
firm's facilities are idle because they cannot get raw materials and 
the other is attempting to secure foreign sources of supplies. A 
director whose firm is a large supplier of chemical products 
reported that their customers are on an allocation basis. Two other 
directors—one from a large diverse manufacturing firm and one from 
a large office equipment manufacturing firm—reported that new 
orders remained strong and that all of their production facilities 
were operating at full capacity. Both firms are viewing 1974 with 
caution, especially in the case of their capital spending plans. 
Finally, a large and diversified manufacturing and construction firm 
indicated that it expects a continuation of at least nine months of 
upward activity. As a result, its capital spending plans are on the 
upswing; it will not be borrowing to finance these additional 
outlays because of a strong internal cash flow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early returns from our monthly survey of manufacturers reveal 
considerable strength in certain key indicators and signs of stress 
in others. In July, the largest proportion of firms reported gains 
in new orders since January. Peak capacity operations and shortages 
of materials have limited the ability of many firms to increase 
shipments, however. Thus, backlogs are continuing to rise and 
delivery times are growing longer. Our survey also shows stepped-up 
inventory accumulation during July. Buyers in the Cleveland area say 
it is difficult to build inventories of finished goods, however, in 
the face of numerous shortages and limitations on production. 
Finally, it now appears that payroll employment in the District is 
leveling off following strong gains through the first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the District's capital goods producers received in July an 
order in excess of $275 million for six nuclear power systems. This 
is reported to be the largest order ever placed in the nuclear 
industry. To achieve economies in design, licensing, and 
construction, five electric utilities acted together (with Federal 
approval) to order standardized nuclear power plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists with three major steel firms in the District report no 
sign of any easing in the demand for steel. Customers' orders are 
being allocated because of capacity limitations, and orders are 
booked solid through the fourth quarter. Nevertheless, production 
and shipments during the second half of 1973 will not be so high as 
in the first half of the year. Approximately 4 million tons of the 
56 million tons shipped in the first half came from steel mill 
inventories--something the steel companies cannot repeat. Production 
at a major steel firm in Cleveland is currently being cut back until 
October in order to reline blast furnaces. The tight steel situation 
is underscored by a comment from one economist to the effect that, 
for the first time since World War II, steel consumption (in the 
second half of 1973) will equal total domestic capacity plus 
imports. The world market for steel is similar to the United States 
situation. With steel prices generally higher abroad, there is now 
less incentive to import. In fact, steel imports in June dropped 
below the year-ago level for the first time this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The economist from a major retail food chain is extremely 
pessimistic with regard to near-term prospects for relief from 
rising food prices. He does not expect an immediate boost in beef 
supplies when the freeze is lifted because of the time it will take 
to get cattle off the farms into feedlots, processed, and 
distributed. He does not expect a drop in retail beef prices until 
January.
     </p>
     <p>
      The economist from a major retailing firm with headquarters in the 
District reported that they have a pessimistic forecast for consumer 
spending for the next four quarters and that recent developments 
have increased their confidence in this projection. Their current 
view is that the peak growth rate for consumer spending was reached 
in early 1973 and that an appreciable decline in the rate of 
expansion in consumer spending will materialize between mid-1973 and 
mid-1974. Their outlook is based on a number of factors, including 
the rapid rise in prices, especially food prices, declining consumer 
confidence, the consumer credit situation, and high interest rates. 
All of these factors are thought to have a negative influence on 
discretionary expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the financial side, the economist at one of the two Federal Home 
Loan Banks in the District reported that savings and loan 
associations in the area have suffered sizable withdrawals of funds 
since early July, and there are indications that the outflows have 
continued thus far in August. In the past month, mortgage rates have 
increased 
25 to 50 basis points at both savings and loan 
associations and banks. In addition, mortgage loan demand is being 
discouraged by requiring larger downpayments and shorter maturities.
