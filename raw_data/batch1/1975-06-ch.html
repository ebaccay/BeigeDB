      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Seventh District are still deteriorating, 
  and prospects appear less favorable, overall, than for the nation 
  for the remainder of the year. This region's important capital goods 
  industries report sharply reduced orders, while demand for consumer 
  durables, also important here, has not recovered significantly. Most 
  manufacturers are cutting inventories, and markets for most 
  materials, components, and finished goods are highly competitive. 
  Transportation volume remains very depressed. No significant pickup 
  is discernible in residential construction activity, but sales of 
  existing units have improved in recent weeks. Employment is probably 
  still declining in the district, with layoffs continuing to be heavy 
  while new hiring remains at a low level. Retailers appear pleased 
  with a modest pickup in sales of seasonal merchandise in recent 
  weeks. Prospects appear excellent for agricultural crops, with 
  plantings completed in ample time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many firms have deferred or stretched out capital expenditure 
  programs because of idle capacity, reduced profits, and reduced 
  estimates of future growth. Most producers of capital goods continue 
  to report cancellations and rescheduling of orders. Cancellations 
  would be greater for some items, for example, railroad equipment, if 
  such steps were not too costly. The market for trucks, trailers, and 
  small construction equipment is very depressed, and demand for farm 
  equipment has weakened. Some oil exploration projects have been 
  curtailed, with the new tax law cited as the reason. Demand remains 
  very strong for capital goods for water control and sewerage 
  facilities, as well as for mining and ore processing (including 
  coal, iron, and copper).
     </p>
     <p>
      Generalized inventory cutting since late last year has created some 
  gaps, with shortages of particular products necessitating increased 
  orders and production. This has occurred in autos, appliances, and 
  recreational equipment. Inventories, generally, are still considered 
  excessive, however. Freight transportation by rail, truck, air, and 
  water has been running 15 to 20 percent below last year, the largest 
  decline since World War II. Much equipment is idle and not wearing 
  out, thereby reducing demand for both new equipment and replacement 
  parts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction is not leading the district out of the 
  recession, as in the past, and time is running out for this year. 
  Housing permits in the Chicago area for four months were down 27 
  percent from last year and down more than 60 percent from 1973. The 
  mortgage on a new 43-story office building on La Salle Street has 
  been foreclosed. Many other commercial and residential projects are 
  in trouble but are not being foreclosed because lenders see no 
  advantage in such a course. Condominiums have been especially hard 
  hit. On the favorable side, sales of houses have picked up in recent 
  weeks, and an act to extend the 9.5 percent usury ceiling in 
  Illinois has been passed by the legislature.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some manufacturers have recalled workers, but total layoffs continue 
  at a high level. Voluntary separations are sharply reduced, and 
  demand for additional workers, including trainees, is very low. New 
  claims for unemployment compensation in May were more than double 
  last year in the district, except for Michigan, where claims were 
  very high last year. Unemployment in the building trades is said to 
  be 30 percent or more in the Chicago area, but unions have obtained 
  increases of 5 to 8 percent after strikes or threats of strikes. 
  (Total compensation of bricklayers is now $11.63 per hour.) The city 
  of Detroit has laid off workers, including police, and Milwaukee may 
  be forced to follow suit. Many college and high school graduates 
  have been unable to find jobs, and temporary summer jobs are hard to 
  find.
     </p>
     <p>
      The largest producer of color TV sets and a major producer of 
  furniture report that consumer demand has picked up in recent weeks, 
  but they imply that they are outpacing their competitors. Sales of 
  boats, recreational vehicles, and appliances (except for chest 
  freezers) remain very poor. Major retailers of general merchandise 
  saw some improvement in sales of apparel and other seasonal 
  merchandise in recent weeks, with a boost from favorable weather. 
  Their inventories are said to be in good shape. Competition has 
  forced a 35-store Chicago area food store chain into bankruptcy, and 
  a national food store chain has been closing a majority of its 
  stores in the Chicago area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop plantings proceeded very rapidly in recent weeks. By June 2, 
  virtually all of the corn and 85 percent of the soybeans in the 
  district had been planted. In Iowa, where rains had delayed 
  operations, farmers were able to plant half of the state's corn in 
  one week—many of them using larger and faster equipment than in the 
  past. Farmers' purchases of fertilizer and equipment have been below 
  expectations this year, reflecting cautious attitudes. Dealers are 
  said to be pushing equipment sales with discounts and more liberal 
  credit terms.
