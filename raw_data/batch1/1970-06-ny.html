      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Remarks by leading bankers and businessmen in the Second District 
suggest a significant further slowdown in economic activity as well 
as increased financial pressures. The labor market is showing signs 
of greater ease; consumers are downgrading their purchases, and 
retail profits are being squeezed very hard; capital spending plans 
are being further reduced; and a growing number of firms may be 
unable to repay their credits at maturity. Although expectations of 
a real recession have increased, inflation continues to be viewed as 
a major problem.
     </p>
     <p>
      As for the labor market, most respondents indicated it was still 
difficult to get "quality" labor, even though there are many more 
applicants than formerly. One, however, declared the market had 
recently undergone a "sharp change", with "quality" people now 
available, and another observed that the rate of turnover amongst 
his firm's management trainees had declined.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending is generally weak, and profits in the retail 
industry have suffered considerably from narrowed margins. 
Conditions were described as "very bad" by the head of a nationwide 
chain of department and discount stores and a top official in one of 
the country's largest department stores characterized late May and 
early June as "very, very soft". Notably weak sectors included home 
furnishings, television sets, large appliances, and men' s wear. 
Among reasons given for consumers "holding back" were: fear of 
unemployment, effects of higher prices, high interest rates, the 
"rather poor" business situation, and "general uncertainty".
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers in general were said to be "downgrading", or to be paying 
more attention to "value", to "utility", to "price". Discount stores 
were reportedly doing better than regular department stores. A "very 
definite tendency" toward downgrading was noted in the purchase of 
clothing. There has also been a definite downgrading in auto buying, 
with a shift toward cheaper models and stripped-down versions 
without radios, air conditioning, or heaters. Moreover, people are 
turning increasingly to used cars. Another sector affected by either 
downgrading or value considerations has been education. Increased 
tuition, as well as other costs, has resulted in lower enrollments 
in private educational institutions, with more students choosing 
state-supported schools. Only a few comments were at odds with the 
"downgrading" picture: food dealers reportedly see an opposite 
trend; and a recently developed camera priced to sell for less than 
$10 is eating up company storage space.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital spending plans for 1970 are reportedly being reduced further 
by many firms. Some are reviewing their plans for the second or 
third time this year; others are resorted to have already trimmed 
plans "significantly". Apparently, projects that are being stretched 
out or delayed are most often those designed to provide additional 
capacity. However, firms in the food industry do not seem to be 
altering their plans, nor are cutbacks being made in plans designed 
to save labor or to reduce pollution.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many business firms are suffering a liquidity squeeze. Among 
contributing factors are reduced profits and a relatively rapid rise 
in accounts receivable. The transportation industry has "real 
liquidity problems", and petroleum companies are finding liquidity 
"more of a problem". The head of a large bank said he was hesitant 
to discuss the "quite serious" corporate liquidity problem because 
of "the possible pyramiding effect", but declared that "many" 
companies may not be able to meet their maturities and that some 
"substantial" corporations will be unable to meet their payrolls 
without refinancing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The liquidity squeeze is having repercussions on the commercial 
paper market. This market is giving one New York City banker 
"nightmares". Some companies that use the market in very large 
volume are having difficulty rolling over their paper. Some 
commercial paper dealers have told some corporations they cannot 
continue to handle their issues. It was estimated that 60 percent of 
all commercial paper "issued today" has back-up bank credit lines; 
if the commercial paper market were "to collapse", the major money 
market banks would not be able "to meet the demand for credit". 
Moreover, many of the "smaller banks" around the country are holding 
"large amounts" of commercial paper.
     </p>
     <p>
      The number of bankers and businessmen who expect a further slowdown 
in the economy has increased markedly. (Upstate New York bankers 
made special note of the "considerable" decline that has occurred in 
new orders received by "many" manufacturers.) Some, however, still 
think it "most likely" there will be a resumption of real growth in 
the second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regardless of expectations as to real growth, there is continued 
concern about wage-cost pressures and the dangers of inflation. Two 
comments seemed to suggest a belief that inflation can be ended only 
by a recession: the public will believe price stability is assured 
only if we have
      <br/>
      "a serious recession or depression"; and the "risk 
of a recession" is preferable to continued inflation. Many bankers 
and businessmen see some sort of incomes policy as desirable. One 
banker expressed opposition to any sort of incomes policy, declaring 
it was not needed and could even do harm by producing an 
anticipatory rise in prices and wages.
