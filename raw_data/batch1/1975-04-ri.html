      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Results of the March survey of Fifth District businesses suggest a 
  marked slowing of the current decline in business activity. There is 
  not yet any indication of a turnaround, but the bottom of the 
  decline may be coming into view. Among manufacturers surveyed, 
  inventories were essentially flat over the February to March period, 
  while backlogs of orders declined further and new orders made their 
  best showing in recent months. Inventories remain above desired 
  levels, but the mild optimism noted last month seems to have grown 
  even stronger in March. Among retailers surveyed, sales weakened 
  slightly after showing some improvement in February; but the 
  inventory picture improved somewhat, although half the respondents 
  feel current inventory levels are excessive. Banking conditions have 
  changed little in the past month; loan demand remains depressed and 
  bank liquidity continues to improve. In the agricultural sector, 
  land preparation for spring planting is lagging behind normal 
  because the recent heavy rains and generally wet weather for the 
  past several weeks have brought farming operations to a near 
  standstill in many areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the manufacturers responding to our survey, approximately one-fourth report increases in shipments and in the volume of new orders 
  during March. While this does not represent a turnaround as such, it 
  suggests some moderation of the pervasive weakness exhibited in 
  recent months. Almost one-half of the respondents indicated further 
  declines in backlogs of orders while the diffusion of responses 
  indicates little or no change in inventory levels. Sixty-eight 
  percent of the manufacturers still view current inventory levels as 
  excessive. But, of those, almost 50 percent feel their inventory 
  adjustment will be completed within three months, and 86 percent 
  expect inventory levels to be brought into line within six months. 
  The responses reveal further declines in the number of employees and 
  in hours worked per week, but the number of manufacturers reporting 
  lower employment and a shorter workweek declined from about 60 
  percent last month to about 40 percent at the end of March. The 
  relative softness displayed by prices received by manufacturers 
  continued and apparently is spreading to prices paid, although in 
  the latter case the movement is less pronounced and could prove 
  tentative. Over 50 percent of the manufacturers still feel current 
  plant and equipment capacity is excessive, but almost 85 percent 
  view current expansion plans as about right. The lessening in 
  pessimism noted last month appears to be turning to mild optimism. 
  Over 50 percent of the manufacturers surveyed expect the level of 
  business activity to improve over the next six months, and over half 
  foresee an improvement in the level of production in their own firms 
  over that time period.
     </p>
     <p>
      The survey of District retailers also suggests some moderation in 
  the rate of decline of business activity, although not to the extent 
  indicated by the manufacturers. The dollar volume of sales showed 
  little change during March as sales of big ticket items relative to 
  total sales remained weak. Responses reveal some further declines in 
  inventories, although half the respondents still view current levels 
  as excessive. Of those retailers with excessive inventories, 
  however, 75 percent feel the adjustment will be completed within 
  three months. Employment among retailers surveyed declined in March, 
  but employee average hourly earnings continued to rise. Price 
  increases continued, but were not quite so widespread as in recent 
  months. As a group, the retailers remain cautiously optimistic, 
  expecting that, at worst, business activity will remain the same 
  over the next six months and that the decline may be near an end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Fifth District banking conditions seem to have changed little since 
  the last Redbook summary. Loan demand remains depressed and banks 
  are apparently continuing their efforts to improve their liquidity. 
  Several banks in the District have expressed a gloomy outlook about 
  the prospects for recovery in the economy before year-end, and are 
  planning accordingly. There is some concern about the retarding 
  effect on recovery which would result from rapidly rising long-term 
  interest rates. As has been the case for nearly a year now, special 
  attention is being given to the loan credit review process.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business loans at weekly reporting banks continued to decline in 
  March, having fallen about 4.5 percent since the beginning of the 
  year. Lending has recently increased only in the chemical and 
  wholesale trade industries. Consumer loans continue their steady 
  decline and have fallen by 6.8 percent since the beginning of the 
  year. Agricultural credits have increased in the past four weeks, 
  but not as much as during the same period last year. Only in South 
  Carolina has business lending turned upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Holdings of CDs seem to have leveled off during March after 
  experiencing a slow decline since early in the year. Net purchases 
  of Federal Funds by District member banks for the first three weeks 
  of the month are about 20 percent below the average level so far 
  this year. Borrowing at the discount window declined for the ninth 
  straight month, with reserve city bank borrowing falling to zero.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District's farmers indicated on March 1 that their total crop 
  plantings in 1975 would be only a little larger than last year. 
  There would be major acreage changes from 1974 for some crops, 
  however. Cotton acreage, now expected to be down 55 percent, shows 
  the biggest decline. But growers' plans for increasing soybean 
  plantings 8 percent will more than offset the cutback in cotton. 
  Moreover, intended tobacco acreage is up 15 percent, while acreage 
  seeded to winter wheat last fall was 11 percent larger.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total cash receipts from farm marketings in January were 10 percent 
  below a year ago, with declines in crop and livestock receipts about 
  equal.
