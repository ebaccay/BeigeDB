      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 20, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although indications of softening in the Ninth Federal Reserve 
District are not as apparent as in the rest of the nation, various 
pieces of quantitive and qualitative evidence suggest that the rate 
of District economic growth has at least slowed down. At the same 
time, however, there does not seem to be any diminution in the 
inflationary psychology of area residents. Consumers apparently are 
cutting back on their level of consumption, and scattered instances 
of businessmen either postponing or at least stretching out some of 
their capital expenditures are being noticed. Currently, a number of 
construction workers in the District are on strike and indications 
are that most of these strikes will last for awhile. Information 
relating to the Teamsters' strike is very sketchy, but it appears 
that some firms are beginning to be affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      During the go-around at the last meeting of the Board of Directors 
of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the directors generally 
felt that business conditions were softening. As evidence of these 
observations, the directors cited such things as unemployment 
increasing in their areas, retail sales becoming sluggish, 
businessmen hesitating to build up inventories, and an almost 
universal observation of slowing in auto sales. In addition, one 
director was aware of a case where a steel company supplying the 
auto industry has cut back its orders of iron ore pellets. One 
director, on the other hand, observed that lumber and wood products 
manufacturers in western Montana have become optimistic in their 
expectations of sales during the latter half of this year. These 
producers were severely affected by the downturn in housing 
construction, but not expect their sales to increase with the 
anticipated upturn in housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      In spite of the business slowdown, the directors felt that 
inflationary psychology has not abated in their local areas, but 
that recent events in Indochina have not had a discernible separate 
effect on inflationary psychology. They also felt that people are 
concerned not only with the effect of inflation, but also with all 
other areas of unrest in this country. One director addressed 
himself to the discriminatory impact of inflation. Although he was 
careful to point out that the problem was also due to other factors, 
he felt that farmers are feeling the ill effects of inflation while 
not sharing in the benefits. For example, he said that while farmers 
recently have had to pay more for input items, the prices of their 
products have not increased accordingly. As a result, the profits of 
farm operations have fallen off.
     </p>
     <p>
      Scattered pieces of information suggest that area businessmen may be 
postponing or at least stretching out their capital expenditures. 
During the first three months of this year, the valuation of 
building permits issued for nonresidential building in the Ninth 
District were about 9 percent below the comparable year-earlier 
period. After adjusting for cost increases over the past year, this 
implies that nonresidential building activity is about 16 percent 
below a year ago. In addition, one director was aware of a 
manufacturing firm in his area that has set back the letting of 
contracts from 60 to 120 days. Also, a Minneapolis-based milling and 
food related conglomerate reported recently that they had cut back 
their capital expenditures. During the current fiscal year they 
expect to spend about $5 million for fixed capital, an amount down 
substantially from the $8.2 million spent last year. Two cases were 
cited at the recent directors meeting, however, which are expected 
to lead to increasing capital expenditures. In one case, it was 
stated that a railroad based in the Ninth District would have to 
expand its capital expenditures to take advantage of the economies 
of scale inherent in a recent merger of four lines. In the second 
case, a copper producer in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan has 
undertaken a housing program which, when completed, will double the 
size of the town in which the mine is located. The ostensible reason 
for the new program was to shorten the commuting time of workers, 
for a number of their employees are now commuting daily from points 
50 to 100 miles away.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major construction contract negotiations are underway in two 
sections of the District. In Minnesota about 10,000 to 12,000 
workers are currently out on strike and about 15,000 to 20,000 
workers are directly affected. Although some disputes have already 
been settled, the majority of union contracts expiring this spring 
are still in the process of negotiation. In general, completed 
negotiations call for wages to increase by more than 50 percent over 
the next two years. The strikes still in progress are expected to 
continue throughout the next three to four weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the highway and heavy construction sectors, the carpenters and 
Teamsters have settled, but the operating engineers appear to be a 
long from settlement. According to a recent newspaper article, 
operating engineers in Minnesota reportedly turned down an offer 
that would increase their wages by 55 percent over the next two and 
a half years presumably because of union dissatisfaction regarding 
the timing of the increases. In the building construction trades, a 
number of strikes are still in progress and probably will not be 
settled for at least three to four weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      In South Dakota, contract negotiations are underway in Sioux Falls 
and Rapid City, the only unionized areas in the state. All building 
construction has been shut down in Sioux Falls as a result of a 
strike by the operating carpenters are in the process of negotiating 
new contracts, but are still working. The unions are requesting wage 
increases of about 15 to 20 percent per year over the next three 
years as opposed to the 10 percent to 12 percent per year increase 
received at the time of the last settlement three years ago.
