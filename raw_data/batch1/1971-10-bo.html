      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1971
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       According to our directors, the consumer sector continued to 
strengthen during September, but business capital spending has not 
generally improved. None of the directors reported any declines in 
their own prices or in the prices of their suppliers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The consumer goods industries continued to show gains in September, 
but this was in line with increases experienced this summer. No 
sudden surge in buying was noted. Dealers in recreational equipment, 
such as snowmobiles, boats, and camping equipment are very 
optimistic and are placing large orders to manufacturers. One 
camping equipment manufacturer still is planning double shifts in 
October to meet demands—a very unusual situation in this seasonal 
business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer loans are reported by a bank director as still doing very 
well, with home improvement loans growing especially rapidly. The 
demand for mortgage loans is also still very high.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital goods producers noted an improvement in the atmosphere but 
not in their orders, which have shown only a gradual improvement. 
This is especially true for the machine tool manufacturers. A large 
District machine toolmaker stated that they did not expect an 
improvement in their orders until the second quarter of 1972. An 
exception to the general picture was a spurt in orders for twin-engine commercial aircraft. Orders for oil field drilling equipment 
are also continuing to do quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only one director was involved in wage negotiations during the 
freeze period. He did not feel that the settlement negotiated had 
been affected by the freeze, although, of course, the negotiated 
wage increases would not be paid until after the freeze.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three of our academic respondents were available for comment this 
month. Although Professors Tobin, Eckstein, and Shapiro agreed that 
there is a good chance of moderating the rate of inflation to the 3-percent upper limit of the Administration's goal range, the 
announcement of Phase II was criticized by each, though for 
different reasons. Tobin thought that 3 percent is a modest goal in 
light of his belief that inflation had been tapering off slowly 
anyhow. Eckstein felt that the control structure is awkward—with the 
Cost-of-Living Council having the bulk of the power and the Price 
and Pay Boards having most of the responsibility. Noting that the 
highly visible major sectors have lagged behind in recent years, he 
objected to the fact that notification was required only in the 
major sectors and voluntary compliance relied upon heavily 
elsewhere. He questioned the absence of a specific program for the 
medical services and transportation sectors and the presence of an 
interest committee, on the grounds that interest controls could be 
accomplished through open market operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shapiro's objections centered on the failure to mention the demand 
stabilizing measures which would be necessary to make the program 
work. In particular, he saw a danger that the political need to 
lower short-term interest rates would bring a flood of liquidity 
which, in conjunction with a strong takeoff in consumer spending and 
the investment stimulus of liberalized depreciation and the 
investment tax credit, could trigger an excessive capital boom in 
the first part of 1973. He cited the historical analogy of the 
expansionary monetary policy of 1954, which led to excessive capital 
spending in 1955 and 1956. A 6-percent rate of growth in the money 
supply, he felt, would be sufficiently moderate to avert this 
danger. Tobin also reasoned by historical analogy, though his 
argument underlined the danger of excessive monetary restraint. He 
cited the 1968 experience of excessive reliance upon the potency of 
fiscal restraint. The danger in the present instance is that of 
placing too much reliance on the fiscal stimulus of responding to 
the urgings that the rate of monetary growth be curtailed. Tobin 
feels that tax reductions for individuals offer a more certain 
fiscal stimulus than corporate reductions, at least when a rapid 
stimulus is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobin also offered a theoretical argument for an expansionary 
policy. Without offering an estimate of the relative size of each 
component, Tobin noted that the current high levels of nominal 
interest rates contain both real and inflationary anticipations 
components. If the anticipatory component is large and if the anti-inflationary controls are successful in reducing inflation, the 
Federal Reserve should accommodate the ensuing fall in rates—to attempt to maintain nominal rates at their previous level would be a 
policy of raising real rates. If, on the other hand, the 
anticipatory component is small, then real rates of interest are 
currently high and would need to be lowered to bring about a sizable 
expansion of the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither Eckstein nor Shapiro was distressed over the current 
international trade situation. Shapiro recalled the erroneous dire 
predictions by "officialdom" and private financial analysis that a 
financial crisis would ensue if gold were "embargoed." Shapiro would 
be content to let the dollar float, eliminate the import surcharge, 
and allow foreign countries to acquire dollars, if they wished, 
while the United States acquired real goods and services. Eckstein 
felt that the high, short-run price elasticity of traded goods would 
restore a trade surplus of nearly $4 billion early in 1972, although 
this amount would not constitute a solution to the problem.
