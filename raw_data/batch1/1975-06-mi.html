      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      District business activity has improved in recent weeks, and Bank 
  directors were able to cite evidence that the recession appears to 
  be bottoming out in their regions. The decline in district labor 
  demand appears to be leveling off, and in some areas job openings 
  have increased. Several directors reported a recent improvement in 
  consumer loan demand, and district business loan demand has been 
  stronger than nationally. Nevertheless, manufacturing sales were 
  expected to remain weak through the end of 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      In commenting on current business activity, directors cited various 
  reasons why they felt that the recession seems to be bottoming out 
  in their areas or industries. A Twin Cities area banker stated that 
  his bank's corporate customers reported that business activity has 
  picked up in recent weeks. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, 
  substantial progress has been made in correcting inventories, and 
  many companies have achieved lower than desired inventory levels. A 
  director whose firm produces consumer food products indicated that 
  his industry's sales prospects have improved in recent weeks. 
  Business in one director's community took a definite turn for the 
  better in May, and a major building products manufacturer in the 
  area has started to recall workers. An Upper Peninsula director 
  reported that a major paper manufacturer recently experienced an 
  increase in orders, but business continues off for the copper 
  industry. Tax rebates have stimulated consumer spending in another 
  director's area, but manufacturing has continued weak. In western 
  South Dakota, preliminary evidence points toward a good tourist 
  season. In the agricultural sector, spring planting has nearly been 
  completed, and moisture conditions are generally satisfactory; if 
  conditions continue to be favorable, large crops are probable this 
  fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite these favorable comments, the results of our latest 
  Industrial Expectations Survey, taken in early May, indicated that 
  manufacturers were feeling the impact of the recession and were not 
  optimistic about their future sales prospects. District 
  manufacturing sales were up 4.5 percent from a year earlier in the 
  first quarter, and they are expected to increase only 1.1 percent in 
  the current quarter. In February, respondents had anticipated a much 
  larger sales advance of about 9 percent in both the first and second 
  quarters. District manufacturers do not foresee any substantial 
  recovery during the last half of this year, as no sales growth is 
  expected in the third quarter and as only a 4.0 percent sales 
  advance is anticipated in the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      District labor market conditions have improved, and several 
  directors indicated that the demand for labor has recently increased 
  in their areas. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, there 
  have been few, if any, recent layoffs of workers. Another Twin 
  Cities director felt that firms would have to start rebuilding 
  inventories and step up production, which, in his opinion, would cut 
  the layoff rate and spur the rehiring of workers. Several directors 
  reported that job openings had increased in areas outside of the 
  Twin Cities metropolitan area and that some firms were recalling 
  workers. However, no directors foresaw any significant decline in 
  their area's unemployment. Recent initial claims data indicated that 
  district joblessness will continue high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors' comments on loan demand also reflect their views about 
  the recent improvement in business activity. Several directors 
  characterized consumer loan demand at banks in their areas as good. 
  Depressed auto sales, however, have held down consumer loans in some 
  areas. District banks have not significantly changed the terms or 
  interest rates for consumer lending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business loan demand has been stronger in the district than in the 
  nation, and directors characterized business loan demand as being 
  either flat, firm, or good. The opinion was expressed that a 
  turnaround in the economy will probably bring forth some increase in 
  business credit demands during the second half of this year. Whether 
  or not this will show up in bank loans, however, depends upon the 
  competition from alternative credit markets. Currently, the wide 
  spread between the prime rate and the commercial paper rate makes it 
  attractive for borrowers to avoid banks. Some companies which had 
  been unable to sell commercial paper during the 1974 credit crunch 
  have now reentered the market. The Bank's directors, in general, 
  reported little change in bank credit requirements or loan terms. 
  One view, however, was that lending policies on business loans in 
  the Twin Cities became more restrictive in the past three months. 
  Also, strict constraints remain on the management of loan 
  commitments.
