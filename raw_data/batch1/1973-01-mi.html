      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

       Although warmer weather in late December temporarily alleviated 
District fuel shortages, the problem reappeared with the return of 
colder weather in early January and currently threatens District 
economic activity. District grain shippers are now experiencing 
difficulty in obtaining boxcars, and this problem will probably 
persist until spring. District retailers enjoyed a very good 
Christmas season and are very optimistic about their sales prospects 
for the first six months of 1973.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although economic activity was not seriously hampered, unseasonably 
cold weather in December revealed severe fuel shortages in the 
District, especially in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. 
No major District manufacturing facility was shut down due to fuel 
shortages, but several large manufacturers' fuel supplies were 
strained and a number of smaller manufacturing plants actually did 
shut down or reduce operations. A steel plant in St. Paul, for 
example, lost forty-eight production hours in December due to lack 
of fuel, and two metal-treating plants in Minneapolis curtailed 
operations. A South Dakota director reports that fuel shortages 
interrupted crop-drying operations in his area and, as a 
consequence, many farmers will be forced to sell their crops at a 
considerable discount.
      </p>
      <p>
       Warmer weather in late December temporarily alleviated District fuel 
shortages, but they reemerged as colder weather returned in early 
January. Minnesota's state civil defense director indicated that 
some fuel oil users currently are having difficulty obtaining needed 
supplies. Also, in order to meet residential heating requirements, a 
major fuel supplier in Minnesota reduced January's fuel allotments 
of airlines, railroads, and trucking firms by 20 percent to 25 
percent, which could result in District transportation services 
being curtailed. In addition, in North Dakota, the Governor has 
instituted emergency measures in order to avoid closing some public 
facilities because of a lack of heating fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors report the District is currently experiencing a 
boxcar shortage. A major grain merchant in the Twin Cities reports 
difficulty obtaining cars and currently could use an additional 
1,000 hopper cars. This firm has resorted to using coal and 
refrigeration cars and does not expect the problem to improve until 
the Great Lakes shipping season starts this spring. Although rail 
transportation was available to fill all ships before shipping on 
the Great Lakes ceased, a Duluth banker reports that sufficient 
boxcars are not available to ship grain currently stored in Duluth, 
especially sunflower seeds destined for Gulf ports, and his area's 
shippers have had to use coal cars. In South Dakota no boxcar 
shortage had yet occurred, but the potential exists. A large amount 
of grain in South Dakota is currently stored under the Government 
loan programs from the 1968, 1969, and 1970 growing seasons, and the 
United States Department of Agriculture recently announced these 
storage contracts will not be renewed. Much of this grain will be 
shipped out of South Dakota when these contracts expire in 1973, and 
a South Dakota director anticipates problems in obtaining needed 
boxcars. A North Dakota director reports that grain elevators in his 
area are full and are refusing to buy grain because boxcars are not 
available for shipping it. No grain is piled outdoors, however, and 
as long as the grain prices remain high no one is losing money 
because of the lack of boxcars. In contrast to the rest of the 
District, directors from Montana indicated that their state, for the 
first time in several years, is not experiencing a boxcar shortage.
      </p>
      <p>
       District retailers enjoyed a very good Christmas season and have a 
very optimistic sales outlook for the first six months of 1973. A 
major Minneapolis-St. Paul area retailer revealed that his firm 
enjoyed excellent business in 1972 and achieved its largest year-to-year relative sales gains in December. His firm estimates that 
department-discount store sales in the Minneapolis-St. Paul 
metropolitan area will be up 12 percent from a year earlier in 1973. 
Other reports from the Twin Cities are that retailers indicated that 
they also enjoyed a very good fourth quarter and expect business to 
remain strong during the first six months of 1973. In addition, 
directors from outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area disclosed 
that their area's merchants had an excellent Christmas season and 
are very encouraged about their business prospects in 1973. A South 
Dakota director, however, stated that many farmers' incomes will be 
curtailed because they were unable to dry their crops in December, 
and this could curb his area's retail spending. Although retailers 
are optimistic about business in 1973, the consensus was that 
inventory rebuilding will be in line with year-earlier levels.
