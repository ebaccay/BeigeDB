      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors, businessmen and economists in the Fourth District are 
  increasingly optimistic about the recovery and have been raising 
  their estimates of output and sales for 1976. Retailers and 
  producers of durable goods are encouraged by a surge in sales and 
  profits in their industries. Capital goods and steel, among the 
  lagging sectors in the District, show signs of reviving, and 
  contacts in those industries report orders and shipments have 
  strengthened in recent weeks. Liquidity of several retailers, 
  manufacturers and thrift institutions has improved sharply in recent 
  quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers and producers of consumer goods are especially encouraged 
  by the sustained rise in consumer spending for automobiles and 
  household goods as well as soft goods. A director with a consumer 
  household products firm reported that sales have been rising faster 
  than expected, and another director indicated that strong demand for 
  materials for home improvement and repairs boosted earnings to their 
  highest level since 1954. Several banker-directors reported 
  installment loan demand is strong, especially for the purchase of 
  large cars. A financial officer for a major discount store chain 
  reported sales and profits for each month this year were well above 
  levels a year earlier. An economist with a soaps and detergents firm 
  noted a recent pickup in several consumer products that had been 
  lagging the recovery in consumer spending. Reports from auto dealers 
  in the Youngstown area, which has one of the highest employment 
  rates in the District, indicate March sales of new cars rose faster 
  there than in the nation, in contrast to a year-over-year decline in 
  both January and February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite widespread strength in consumer goods sales, inventories 
  apparently will be kept under tight control. A retailer noted their 
  inventories are adequate but not much higher than late last year. 
  One producer, while reporting inventories of some product lines are 
  probably lean, is apparently willing to err on the conservative 
  side. In contrast, inventory demand for automotive tires has 
  ballooned, partly because stocks are considered too low relative to 
  sales and partly as a hedge against a strike in the rubber industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods producers are also more encouraged over prospects for 
  recovery in their industry because of better than expected incoming 
  orders. A director, with an electric typewriter firm, reported that 
  orders increased more than expected last month and that their new 
  copiers introduced recently have been well received by the trade. An 
  electronics equipment and printing press producer reported that 
  incoming orders during the first quarter of 1976 were the highest on 
  record and that orders for all types of printing equipment are now 
  recovering. Orders last quarter were 50 percent ahead of shipments, 
  and will require a boost in output as well as employment in the 
  months ahead. Orders for bearings turned up from a broad range of 
  customers. An economist, usually one of the most bearish in capital 
  goods, recently scaled upward his estimates of real capital spending 
  from a decline to virtually no change from last year. Upward 
  revision of estimates for shipments of excavating machinery and 
  cranes, from an expected 15 percent pickup last fall to the latest 
  20-25 percent, was reported by another capital goods producer in the 
  District. This expected improvement reflects more rapid completion 
  of liquidation of excavators at the distributor level as well as 
  higher spending for construction by some State and local 
  governments. Machine tool orders continue to climb, although the 
  year-old rebound has recovered only about half of the drop in orders 
  that occurred during 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel inventory liquidation has been virtually completed, and little 
  if any change is expected this quarter. Inventories of flat rolled 
  products are likely to be built and offset some further liquidation 
  of steel held by firms in capital goods industries. An economist 
  with a major steel company revised upward his 1976 forecast for 
  steel shipments and production because auto and truck production is 
  running stronger than their earlier expectations. Another firm 
  reported that delivery schedules for some of its lines are 
  lengthening from 2 weeks to as much as 2 months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Improved liquidity and debt structure for a variety of financial and 
  nonfinancial firms is increasingly mentioned by directors and other 
  respondents in support of a more optimistic view of economic 
  activity. A banker-director termed as "very liquid" an office 
  equipment firm that had been considered financially weak in recent 
  years. His corporate customers are borrowing in long-term markets. 
  Another banker-director reported banks and thrift institutions in 
  his area are highly liquid. S&amp;Ls in the District generally report 
  continued strong growth in deposits, and several are eager to cut 
  rates paid on passbook deposits in view of high liquidity. A major 
  discount store chain in the District that was near bankruptcy in 
  1975 has boosted its current ratio from 1.7 to 2.1 in recent 
  quarters, and cut back its long-term debt by at least 10 percent. A 
  large producer of consumer products, whose usually large excess 
  working capital was run down in 1974-1975, has again sharply boosted 
  its liquid asset position to a point where it can finance all of its 
  capital spending plans for 1976. An official with a major machinery 
  firm reports a dramatic shift in its financial situation from a net 
  borrowed position to a surplus over the past 12 to 15 months, partly 
  because of record cash flow last quarter. For some other firms, 
  concerns seem to have shifted from working capital shortages and 
  financing problems to building inventories and increasing production 
  schedules.
     </p>
     <p>
      The rising optimism that seems to permeate the attitude of 
  businessmen in the District is tempered somewhat by inflationary 
  wage settlements. One source indicated that the total increase in 
  compensation in the first year of the Teamsters contract amounted to 
  15 to 20 percent. A director viewed as "not too explosive" his 
  firm's recent labor settlement for a 9 percent increase in 
  compensation. Rubber works are expected to settle for less than the 
  Teamsters, although a cost of living catch-up is expected to be a 
  result of a settlement, with a short strike likely to affect at 
  least one of the major tire producers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in employment in the District remains sluggish and 
  continues to lag the nation. The small improvement that has occurred 
  has been mainly in rubber and plastics, trade, and fabricated 
  metals. Employment in steel, machinery and construction industries 
  has tended to stabilize in recent months, while earlier gains in 
  automotive industry have been held down by recent layoffs at the GMC 
  Lordstown plant, where compact cars are assembled. Since late March, 
  over 2,000 workers were placed on indefinite layoff.
