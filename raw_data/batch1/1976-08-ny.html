      Beige Book Report: New York

      </strong>

     <p>
      The Second District economy continues to have difficulty gaining 
  momentum, according to District directors and business economists 
  contacted recently. Regional retail sales apparently softened in 
  July, with the weakness heavily concentrated in apparel. However, 
  sizable inventory imbalances were avoided, for the most part, 
  largely as a result of cautious purchasing policies. Further 
  improvement in home building appears uncertain, with high prices and 
  a backlog of unsold homes restraining construction of single-family 
  units and few signs of any pickup in multiple-family residences. 
  Overall, the regional economy still lags behind that of the nation, 
  in large measure because of the prolonged slump in activity in New 
  York City.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in the Second District slowed in July. Retail 
  sales in New York City were characterized as sluggish by department 
  store executives. Directors from the Buffalo area reported that, 
  aside from the auto sector, July sales softened considerably from 
  June and sales in the first few days of August gave no indication of 
  marked improvement. The president of a Rochester retail store 
  indicated that the weakness was general throughout the state. An 
  official of a trade publication felt that to a large extent the 
  weakness stemmed from a slowdown in spending on apparel, and that 
  buyers appeared to have become value conscious. Despite this 
  softness, the president of a major nationwide retailer which 
  specializes in apparel did not expect the slowdown to continue in 
  coming months. Some respondents noted a change in the mix of 
  consumer spending, as purchases of appliances apparently have held 
  up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers appear to be very cautious in building inventories, 
  responding quickly to changes in expected sales growth. As evidence 
  of this, virtually every analyst contacted cited the fact that large 
  inventory buildups did not accompany the sales slowdown. 
  Nevertheless, some imbalances remain in the composition of 
  inventories—old spring and summer stock versus new fall lines. 
  Directors of the Buffalo Branch reported that promotions and 
  markdowns had only limited success in moving merchandise. A senior 
  official of a national retailer said his chain's markdowns would 
  continue into August. A business analyst reported that outright 
  order cancellations were rare but that many retailers appeared to be 
  limiting or delaying ordering new merchandise and were planning 
  instead to reorder if demand proved sufficiently strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Continuing problems with multifamily building were seen as limiting 
  prospects of a pickup in the rate of recovery of residential 
  construction. A senior economist of a major appliance manufacturer 
  felt that home building was in a bind created by an imbalance 
  between personal income and the high carrying and downpayment costs 
  of a new home. The large backlog of unsold units was seen by another 
  analyst as further restraining any near-term acceleration in 
  activity. One director reported some spotty pickup in housing 
  activity in central New York State. Outside of residential activity, 
  a regional analyst thought that public construction spending in New 
  York State would remain at a standstill for the near term. 
  Commercial activity was seen as possibly recovering modestly, with 
  the building of shopping centers and stores.
     </p>
     <p>
      Overall, the regional economy continues to lag behind that of the 
  nation. To a large extent, this is due to the failure of the New 
  York City economy to revive. Over the first half of the year, 
  estimates suggest that the City accounted for almost nine out of 
  every ten jobs lost in the State. Total employment in New York City, 
  seasonally adjusted, has continued to decline. To be sure, private 
  employment appears to have stabilized, but at the lowest level since 
  record keeping began in 1950. The rate of joblessness in the City is 
  some 3 percentage points above the national average. Even this wide 
  differential disguises the depth of the metropolitan area's slump, 
  however, because a substantial reduction in the labor force has been 
  an important factor in holding down the unemployment rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the weakness of the City's economy, a commercial bank 
  economist felt that part of the economic sluggishness of the region 
  reflected the importance of capital goods production in upstate New 
  York. As a mature region with older, less efficient plants, the 
  upstate region responds to a revival in capital spending with a lag—reportedly moving ahead with vigor only when national capital 
  spending is well into an expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      As to the overall outlook for the national economy, a senior 
  economist of a financial firm was highly optimistic, expecting a 
  long-lived recovery and a sharp moderation in inflation. On the 
  other hand, another senior economist expressed apprehension over the 
  danger of a future pickup in real growth with concomitant upward 
  price pressures. An economist of a major business equipment producer 
  looked for deceleration in real growth but anticipated a favorable 
  price performance. With regard to industrial materials prices, the 
  president of a major metals firm felt that, while there would be 
  further increases, a relative "breather" was likely compared with 
  recent previous months. A nonferrous metals economist viewed as 
  likely an additional copper price increase late in the year, with 
  the possibility that the price of aluminum ingots would rise early 
  next year. The Buffalo directors felt that, with substantial 
  agricultural production in prospect, price pressures in this sector 
  would be modest.
