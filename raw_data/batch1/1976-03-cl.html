      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Businessmen and economists in the Fourth District are growing more 
confident that the recovery now under way will be sustained through 
1976 and continue into 1977. Retailers have been buoyed by recent 
strengthening in household durable goods sales. Auto producers 
expect substantially improved sales, and steel producers report 
demand is recovering now that liquidation of steel stocks is 
virtually completed. Economists who met at the Bank early in March 
raised their forecasts of real gross national product (GNP), 
industrial production, and business fixed investment from estimates 
made last fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recent strengthening in sales of appliances and other household 
goods has led both retailers and producers of these goods to raise 
their estimates of sales and output. An official with a national 
chain of department stores headquartered in the District expects an 
increase in real dollars of 9 percent in soft goods sales and 10 
percent in hard goods sales this year, compared with a 4 percent 
gain and a 4 percent decline, respectively, in 1975. A rise in 
employment, expansion in the workweek, reduction in the savings 
rate, an increase in the use of installment credit, and small 
increases in consumer prices are among factors retailers see 
boosting consumer confidence and supporting steady strengthening in 
consumer spending. He pointed out that real retail sales of soft
goods have been rising since early 1975, but hard good sales turned 
up only recently. Retailers are not expected to build their 
inventories until late this year. A $400 million discount department 
store chain that was close to bankruptcy early last year reported a 
sharp turnaround in earnings that improved its liquidity and its 
relationships with creditors.
       </p>
       <p>
        An economist for a major auto producer now estimates domestic new 
car sales for 1976 at 8 1/2 million units, considerably above his 
estimate late last fall. Consumer tendency to upgrade during an 
economic recovery, disillusionment with small cars, and lower gas 
prices are among factors cited for the recent shift from small to 
large cars. He expects imported cars to account for no more than 14 
percent of the new car market again this year because of the price 
advantage and improved fuel economy of domestic cars. He expects a 
banner auto year of $11 million in sales in 1977 but is very 
uncertain over prospects for 1978 and beyond because of legislation 
affecting emissions and fuel economy. Economists associated with 
steel and rubber industries expect that sales of domestic new cars 
will range from 8.3 million to 8.5 million units this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel-industry economists expect orders to improve 10 to 15 percent 
this quarter because of rising steel consumption and an end to the 
year-long liquidation of inventories. Two economists expect output 
to rise 35 percent this year over last year's depressed volume, and 
one expects that operations in the fourth quarter of 1976 may be 
close to capacity depending upon the extent of recovery in capital 
goods and the extent to which steel consumers rebuild inventories.
       </p>
       <p>
        The capital goods sector continues to lag the recovery. Several 
producers report some pickup in orders from depressed levels in 
1975, but none expect a sharp recovery until 1977. An economist with 
a major machine-tool builder reports orders in recent months were 50 
percent greater than in the first quarter of 1975 but were still 60 
percent below the peak in the second quarter of 1974. He noted that 
environmental and conservation regulations are holding down orders 
from the automotive industry. Another economist expects only a 5 to 
6 percent increase in capital spending for 1976 because of a lack of 
orders from the transportation and utilities industries. Orders for 
industrial materials began to strengthen in recent months, but 
demand for motors and generators is still weak. A producer of frames 
for heavy-duty trucks expects a pickup in orders for the second 
quarter of 1976 in line with a rising trend in industrial 
production, reduced inventories of these trucks, and growing 
confidence on the part of truck producers. A director reports their 
capital spending plans for 1976 will remain unchanged from 1975 and 
about 15 percent below the recent high in 1974. A mining-machinery 
producer also expects that their capital expenditures this year will 
be about the same as in 1975, although sharply above the 1974 level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty-six economists representing major and industrial corporations 
in the Fourth District met at this Bank on March 5. They raised 
forecasts of real growth in economic activity during 1976 from 
levels that they had estimated at a similar meeting late last fall. 
The median forecast of the group shows real GNP increasing 6.2 
percent and industrial production rising 9.3 percent from 1975. Only 
seven participants expected stronger real growth in the first half 
than in the second half of 1976. Inflation, measured by the GNP 
price deflator, is expected to average 6 percent and unemployment, 
7.6 percent. Both estimates are virtually unchanged from estimates 
last fall. Several of the participants expressed the view that 
inflation will moderate more than indicated in the median forecast. 
A bank economist expects the deflator to rise at a 4 percent later 
this year, an economist with a major consumer goods producer expects 
a range of 4 to 5 percent, and an economist with another industrial 
firm expects a range of 5 to 6 percent. Two economists, who 
represent capital-equipment-producing firms, expect the prices for 
capital equipment will rise about 5 to 6 percent instead of the 9 
percent predicted by the United States Department of Commerce. 
Retail price increases for OAF merchandise are expected to average 
about 4.4 percent at the end of 1976, compared with 4 percent in the 
fourth quarter of 1975 and 11 percent for the fourth quarter of 
1974.
       </p>
       <p>
        Preliminary results of our monthly survey of manufacturers for 
February show improvement in labor utilization for the first time 
since last fall. Also, more firms reported higher prices than in 
recent months. Improvement in labor market conditions is expected to 
be sustained this month, and some relaxation in price increases is 
expected.
