      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business activity in the Eighth Federal Reserve District continues 
  upward, according to reports of area businessmen. Consumer demand 
  remains strong, especially for automobiles and other durable goods. 
  Manufacturing activity, though still somewhat below capacity, is 
  improving. Increased operating ratios for manufacturing firms have 
  so far had little impact on prices. Financial institutions report 
  some increase in interest rates as loan demands inch up. Savings 
  flows into thrift institutions continue to increase but at a more 
  moderate rate than in the first quarter of the year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales continued to register overall gains in recent weeks, 
  but department store representatives report that increases in sales 
  have not been as large as expected. Sales increased in May at only 
  about one-half the expected rate of gain. Analysts point out that 
  comparisons with year-ago sales may be biased by the expenditures 
  associated with the tax rebates last year. In addition, the slower 
  rate of growth in department store sales may reflect the rising 
  consumer preference for automobiles and other durable goods. 
  Appliance and automobile sales are reported to have been excellent 
  in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      This month's interviews with manufacturing firms were conducted with 
  special emphasis on current operations as a percent of normal 
  capacity and the pressures that rising operating levels have had on 
  prices. In general, firms are reported to be operating somewhat 
  below normal capacity. Lack of demand is the reason most often given 
  for this
      <br/>
      less-than-capacity level of output. But demand is 
  continuing to increase and excess capacity is declining. A steel 
  representative reports current utilization is slightly over 80 
  percent of capacity. Price increases for steel products, which go 
  into effect this month, were reported to be necessary to cover 
  capital costs. A major feed and food processor reported operations 
  in this sector to be about 70 to 75 percent of capacity, with upward 
  pressures on prices not expected until at least 90 percent of 
  capacity is attained. A manufacturer of welding equipment is 
  operating currently at 90 percent of capacity on some items while at 
  full capacity on others. A representative of this firm noted that 
  raw material prices are increasing rapidly and that his firm's 
  prices will be increased soon. An auto assembly plant in the St. 
  Louis area has plans to operate at full capacity for the first time 
  since 1974 by adding a second shift this fall. A manufacturer of 
  electric motors for appliances also reported operating at virtual 
  capacity in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Representatives of a few industries reported a shortage of capacity 
  at the present time, and large price increases for products of these 
  industries are expected. A distributor of hydraulic equipment parts 
  noted that a seller's market has developed for these products. 
  Capacity has not been increased substantially in this industry 
  during the past few years, and rising demands have resulted in order 
  backlogs up to six months. Some products used in the oil and gas 
  industry were also reported to be in short supply, though price 
  increases for these products have so far been moderate. However, 
  increases in basic raw material costs for this industry are expected 
  to contribute to price increases in the near future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Interest rates are beginning to inch up again, according to reports 
  from area bankers and thrift institution officials. The most 
  prevalent mortgage rate in St. Louis is still 8 1/2 percent on an 
  80-percent loan, but 8 3/4 percent is becoming increasingly common. 
  One savings and loan representative predicted that 8 3/4 percent 
  would become the dominant rate within another month. The pressure 
  for mortgage rates to rise locally is said to reflect higher-yielding investment opportunities in national markets rather than 
  any sharp upturn in local mortgage demand. Business loan demand at 
  commercial banks has inched up in recent weeks, according to 
  representatives of larger banks. Gains in volume of real estate, 
  consumer installment, and agricultural loans were registered in May. 
  One bank predicted an increase in loan demand through the summer, 
  with an accompanying increase in rates charged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Statistics for the St. Louis area show no growth of savings deposits 
  at savings and loan associations in April, but reports indicate some 
  increase in May. Reports from other areas also indicate savings 
  deposits continue to make gains but at a reduced rate from earlier 
  in the year. Minor changes in rates offered on deposits at several 
  savings and loan associations were noted in recent weeks. Minimum 
  amounts for long-term certificates at some associations were raised 
  from $1,000 to $10,000 or more, and the rates paid were reduced by 
 
    one-fourth of one percent. The recent tendency for mortgage rates to 
  rise is expected to forestall further rate reductions on deposits.
