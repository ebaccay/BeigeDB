      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Moderate recovery, based mainly on strength in residential 
construction and some consumer outlays, continues to epitomize the 
course of the economy. Optimism prevails despite widespread slack in 
employment and business loan demand. The range of response from 
Reserve Banks is small. At best, the economy is expanding "on a 
broad front" and "at a steady pace." Superlatives were confined 
mainly to demand for consumer household durables, heavy trucks and 
building materials. At worse, there are "some signs of recovery," 
though the upturn "can barely be perceived" in the eyes of some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Phase II has been generally accepted" and has been regarded as 
helpful so far in aiding competitive forces to limit price 
increases. Some criticisms have developed, however, which may menace 
its future. Numerous declines in interest rates, particularly on 
mortgages and consumer deposit accounts, are reported. Savings flows 
have held up well. While some concern was expressed over the size of 
the Federal deficit, most were centered on the fear that large 
deficits will become a fiscal "way of life," which could not be 
abandoned as the economy approaches full employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anticipated business investment remains very strong, though the 
concrete signs that have already emerged are mixed. In a survey of 
the corporate treasurers of Fortune's 650 nonfinancial firms, the 
Philadelphia bank found planned spending on plant and equipment will 
increase by 10 percent in 1972. That bank, along with Atlanta and 
Chicago, found numerous incidents of plant expansions and new 
plants. Neither New York, Cleveland, St. Louis, San Francisco, or 
Boston, however, found signs of a surge in capital spending. While 
the high level of unused capacity is typically cited as the cause, 
St. Louis found sluggish capital expenditures among some firms 
experiencing higher operating to capacity ratios. Although a 
majority of firms reporting to the New York bank anticipated higher 
inventory outlays, Kansas City encountered "further inventory 
reductions, and no inventory buildup-sometimes in spite of increased 
sales expectations." Neither Richmond nor Boston reported systematic 
inventory replenishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a pickup in the pace of manufacturing orders, shipments, 
and backlogs in the Philadelphia, Atlanta, Richmond, and Chicago 
Districts. Steel companies in the Cleveland District expect first 
quarter shipments to outstrip last quarter's by 25 percent. Steel 
orders have picked up in recent weeks in Cleveland, and in Chicago 
they show the broadly based gain which had been expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the increases in employment were recorded in the East. 
Philadelphia found that 10 percent of manufacturing firms surveyed 
had increased employment and 17 percent had increased average hours. 
Richmond noted shortages of skilled and unskilled labor. Scattered 
gains also occurred in upstate New York and in the Cleveland and 
Atlanta Districts. Elsewhere the employment picture remained bleak, 
either stagnating or deteriorating. Little improvement was the story 
in Boston, St. Louis, and most of New York, while some layoffs 
appeared in Dallas, Cleveland, and Minneapolis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continued strength in construction, primarily residential 
construction, and heavy output of lumber and wood products were both 
mentioned often. Financing proved not to be a problem, as savings 
flows were reported to have held high or even accelerated, while 
mortgage rates have either fallen, as in Richmond and Minneapolis, 
or downward pressure has developed, as in St. Louis. Some demand 
problems, resulting from overbuilding, have popped up for 
apartments, in Atlanta and in the Twin Cities, and in retail selling 
and office space, in Atlanta and in the Chicago loop district.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fear of competition from savings and loan associations has kept 
commercial banks in the Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Cleveland 
Districts from cutting rates paid on consumer time deposits. Several 
banks have indicated to the Cleveland bank "that a further reduction 
in the prime rate would probably force them to cut their deposit 
rates, regardless of whether other institutions followed. Most banks 
maintained that they could not successfully cut deposit rates unless 
they were convinced that savings and loans would follow, but they 
see no reason to expect savings and loans to reduce deposit rates as 
long as mortgage rates remain at current levels."
      </p>
      <p>
       Variations abound in the sales performance of consumers' goods. Good 
gains in general retail sales materialized in San Francisco and in 
Richmond. Demand was vigorous for consumer household durables in 
Chicago, and new orders were encouraging in Boston. Strong durable 
goods sales in Minneapolis accompanied only modest increases in the 
sale of nondurables. Mixed patterns were also experienced in St. 
Louis, where services were strong and department store sales were 
weak, and in Dallas, where department store sales were up and new 
automobile registrations were down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kansas City and Richmond reported buoyancy in consumer loan demand, 
but they, along with Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, and San 
Francisco, continued to report weak business loan demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The three academic respondents contacted by Boston agreed that an 
expansive policy should be continued until additional signs of 
strength appear.
