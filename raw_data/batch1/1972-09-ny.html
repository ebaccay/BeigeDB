      Beige Book Report: New York

      <strong>
       September 13, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The views of this Bank's head office and Buffalo Branch directors on 
the economic situation and outlook remain about unchanged. On 
balance, the directors believe the recovery is continuing, and they 
remain reasonably optimistic about the outlook. The primary concern 
voiced about the future was the prospect for worsening inflation. It 
was stressed that the collective bargaining calendar for 1973 is 
heavy, the Federal deficit is large and widening, and that wage and 
price controls might be dismantled prematurely. On the brighter 
side, several directors cited evidence of a strong capital spending 
outlook for 1973, and there were a number of comments that indicated 
further improvement in the local employment picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       The performance of retail sales were generally pictured as little 
changed from the recent past. Retail demand was described as strong 
in New York City, Rochester and Jamestown. One banker director did 
say his information indicated a somewhat mixed picture in the 
upstate area, but went on to attribute that to special local factors 
such as bad weather. Several directors also observed that retail 
sales are generally stronger in the suburbs than in the central 
cities, and that back-to-school buying had been encouraging.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning prospective business plant and equipment outlays, several 
directors felt such outlays would rise rapidly in 1973. An upstate 
banker said he expected "very strong" capital spending on the basis 
of his bank's loan commitments for "pay out" in the first half of 
next year. A senior official of the largest upstate firm also 
expressed confidence that capital spending would show "an impressive 
gain", in part as a result of the ample availability of both 
external and internal funds. The president of a major oil company 
saw the possibility for an improvement next year in his industry's 
capital spending picture, following the drop that had occurred in 
1972. Another director also foresaw continued rapid growth of 
capital outlays by municipal governments. On the other hand, one 
upstate banker stated that he did not look for a significant 
upgrading of existing capital spending plans, and an upstate 
manufacturer pointed to the current level of unused capacity, as 
well as to the uncertainties related to the election, as factors 
currently inhibiting the expansion of capital spending plans. Also, 
the president of a large metal producing firm stated he was "not 
bullish" with respect to plant and equipment spending in the metals 
industry, in part because of continued excess capacity and depressed 
profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       The directors, with some exceptions, felt the current demand for 
commercial and industrial bank loans was not particularly strong. 
The major exception was the chairman of the board of a large New 
York City bank, who stated that there had been a substantial pickup 
in commercial and industrial loans at his bank since mid-year. An 
upstate banker reported some strengthening in connection with a 
continued rapid growth of capital outlays by municipalities. The New 
Jersey banker reported a good loan demand from local businesses, but 
noted that borrowings at his bank by national corporations has as 
yet remained modest. Also, several upstate bankers characterized 
current commercial and industrial loan demand as "quite soft". One 
of these bankers, however, said the current weakness might be 
seasonal, and that he was expecting a strengthening in demand in the 
coming months. The senior official of the largest upstate firm also 
felt loan demand was picking up, but not as rapidly as might be 
expected in the light of the pace of the economic recovery—a fact 
he attributed in good part to the current highly liquid positions of 
many large corporations. Similarly, an upstate manufacturer observed 
that current industrial cash flow seemed sufficient to fill normal 
financial needs. The president of the major oil company reported 
that bank credit to the petroleum industry had been declining since 
mid-1969, partly because of increased reliance of those firms on the 
commercial paper market.
      </p>
      <p>
       The responses concerning the employment picture were encouraging. 
Continued strength was reported in the Rochester area, where there 
is now a shortage of skilled personnel, especially in the 
construction industry. A similar assessment was made by the New 
Jersey banker who, as an example, reported that his bank has had 
difficulties in obtaining people to build a new bank building. And, 
the president of the major metal producing firm noted that the 
employment situation in the coal industry has continued to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, broad concern was expressed by the directors over the 
outlook for wage and price inflation. References were made variously 
to the "unhealthy" Federal budget situation, to the heavy collective 
bargaining calendar for 1973 and the possible pace-setting effect of 
large wage settlements recently negotiated in Canada, to the 
prospect for higher gasoline and heating oil prices later this year 
as supplies run short, and to fears that existing wage and price 
controls might shortly be scrapped.
