       The general feeling among area businessmen and bank Directors is 
that consumer confidence in the ninth district is still at a low 
ebb, and there are few indications that it has improved over the 
last month or so. Business loan demand continues to be very strong 
while consumer loan demand is still weak. Price shading at both the 
wholesale and retail level does not seem to be any more prevalent 
than it was a few months ago, but there are some indications that 
firms are determining their prices more carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is little to suggest that consumer confidence in this district 
has changed over the last month. With three exceptions, the 
Directors of this bank were not aware of anything that would point 
to an imminent rise in consumer spending, two Directors who could 
not cite anything specific had a general feeling that consumer 
spending in their areas was generally better than had been 
anticipated. Another also felt that although there was some firming 
up in his area, the mix of expenditures has been changing. For 
example, motorcycle and snowmobile dealers have been experiencing 
record sales, but automobile purchases are down. Housing is the only 
district sector that seems to be gaining strength.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Directors 
  stated that real estate loan activity in their banks was increasing 
  and more people were contemplating home purchases in their areas. 
  One, however, noted that most of the turnover was in existing 
  housing and new construction had not yet begun to improve. In 
  contrast to the generally weak business loan demand in other parts 
  of the country, the demand for business loans in the ninth district 
  appears to be quite strong. Conversations with three reserve city 
  bankers revealed that the rise in their business loans is stronger 
  than they had anticipated, and some of these people felt that the 
  recent cuts in the prime rate were unjustified, at least for their 
  banks. One Director, who is also the president of a reserve city 
  bank, said that although he keeps expecting his bank's outstanding 
  loan balances to fall, they keep rising to new highs. He feels that 
  a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that his national 
  customers have tended to ignore the corporate bond market as a 
  source of debt funds and instead are relying on banks for their 
  borrowings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three other Directors from rural areas in the district also felt 
that loan demand was picking up. Although they were not sure of the 
reasons for the strengthening, they were able to cite instances 
pointing to a rise in loan demand. One South Dakota Director said, 
for example, that a number of banks in his area had dropped out of 
participation pools because they were able to use all their loanable 
funds for local borrowers. Consumer loan demand, on the other hand, 
has not changed significantly over the past month or so and still 
seems to be generally weak. While three Directors felt that they 
have noticed some slight strengthening in their areas, for the most 
part they could not attribute the change to anything specific.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the strength in business loan demand and the weakness in the 
consumer sector, most of the softening in interest rates has been in 
the business sector, primarily because of the reductions in the 
prime rate. Generally, consumer loan rates have not changed although 
one Director stated that his bank is shading rates to good 
customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage rates in the Twin Cities have remained relatively stable 
over the last month. The going rate on FHA-VA mortgages is now 
running at 7 percent plus 2-3 points to the seller, and the 
conventional mortgage rate is around 7-1/2 percent with 25 percent 
down and 30-year maturities. There is some talk among industry 
people, however, that the conventional rate will soften because of 
the recent reductions in mortgage rates in other parts of the 
country and the strong liquidity positions of district thrift 
institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Price shading does not seem to be more prevalent in this area, but 
wholesalers and retailers appear to be watching their prices more 
carefully. Only one Director was aware of any changes in mark-offs 
during the past few months, and these were generally limited to 
office machines. Another commented that he has noticed some firms 
raising prices but then selectively making concessions. On the other 
hand, a number of cases of more aggressive pricing and merchandising 
emerged. In the utility industry, some suppliers have cut prices on 
transformers and aluminum wire, while several announced price 
increases have been rescinded because others refused to follow the 
rise. In addition, retailers are merchandising their wares more 
aggressively in an attempt to get people into the stores. According 
to one Director, at least, this practice has been successful in his 
area, and retail sales have been picking up.
