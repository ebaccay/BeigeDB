      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The decline in district economic activity has been slowing, but 
  signs of recovery in overall economic activity have not yet been 
  pronounced. Inventory liquidation at the manufacturing level 
  accelerated. Nonautomotive retail sales improved. Inflationary 
  pressures continued to abate. Output and employment have been 
  recovering in some industries such as autos, tires, and chemicals. 
  Other industries, notably steel, have still been reducing 
  operations. Residential construction edged up. Some major banks were 
  reported to have been following conservative loan policies.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the retail sector, the treasurer of a large discount store chain 
  said sales have improved in recent weeks and inventories have been 
  brought under better control. He noted that price markdowns, which 
  have been used to entice consumers, will not be as extensive in the 
  months ahead because profits have been squeezed and inventories 
  reduced. The treasurer of a major Cleveland department store also 
  reported that sales picked up in May and early June, although big-ticket items still have not begun to move. Its inventories also have 
  been whittled down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Latest reports from Cleveland purchasing agents and early returns 
  from our survey of district manufacturers indicated further slowing 
  in the decline of new orders, production, and employment during May. 
  Most companies said they are letting attrition reduce their work 
  forces. Inventory liquidation of raw materials, supplies, and 
  finished goods was greater than for any other month this year. 
  Inflationary pressures continued to ease as purchasing agents 
  reported that they have been negotiating lower prices, higher 
  discounts, and improved terms. For the third consecutive month, 
  twice as many purchasing agents have been paying lower prices as 
  higher prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among favorable industrial developments, auto companies continued to 
  recall some laid off workers. An economist with a major tire firm 
  said the tire industry, on balance, has started to recall workers. 
  Sales and production have been recovering. The economist estimates 
  that during the next four or five months the industry will reduce 
  inventories further by allowing tire sales to increase at a faster 
  rate than production. A chemical industry spokesman said chemical 
  products that were depressed in the earliest part of the recession 
  have rebounded, with output now up to 70 percent of capacity, 
  compared with 50 percent in December-January.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the steel industry, many large and small firms throughout the 
  district recently announced temporary or indefinite employment 
  cutbacks; thousands of workers are being affected. One large firm 
  has decided against reopening its idled Ohio facilities, and 1,250 
  jobs are being eliminated. An economist with a major steel company 
  said new orders declined somewhat more than expected but have been 
  showing signs of leveling off. Some customers that had not ordered 
  for months (for example, appliances) have begun to come back. 
  Several steel firms reported uncertainties developing among oil 
  country producers because of new depletion allowance rules. In 
  particular, independent drillers have no longer been so bullish. 
  Energy-related industries, which had been strong steel buyers 
  throughout the recession, have now been reducing orders and cutting 
  inventories. Steel sources say customer inventory liquidation has 
  not yet run its course. Steel sheet has been the largest part of the 
  excessive inventories, especially at the steel service centers.
     </p>
     <p>
      According to the chief executive officer of a major utility in 
  northeastern Ohio, business from industrial accounts, especially 
  steel, machine tools, and other machinery goods, has been pointing 
  down. He also indicated that they have been experiencing some 
  collection problems in higher income neighborhoods.
     </p>
     <p>
      There have been scattered signs of improvement in the capital 
  spending sector, amidst still basically weak market conditions. 
  Dollar awards for nonresidential building edged up slightly but have 
  remained well below last autumn's level. Printing press orders have 
  improved, following softness for several months. A major machine 
  tool firm reported a significant rebound in new orders booked during 
  May, following a wave of cancellations in April. On the less 
  encouraging side, an Ohio office equipment producer announced it 
  will lay off 700 employees during the remainder of the year. A major 
  supplier to the heavy duty truck market has scheduled an extended 
  shutdown this summer because of poor business. Weak auto sales have 
  caused a large steel firm in Ohio to postpone indefinitely its plans 
  to expand plant capacity for producing steel sheets used by the auto 
  industry.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction contracts have improved moderately during 
  the past few months. An economist with a Federal Home Loan Bank in 
  the district said that net deposit inflows at S&amp;Ls; were very strong 
  again in May and that the supply of funds available for mortgages 
  far exceeds demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists from three major Cleveland banks said their banks have 
  been following conservative loan policies in order to build 
  liquidity and capital. They also expressed the view that 
  conservative loan policies could inhibit a sharp recovery in 
  economic activity. One stated that his bank has been accepting as 
  little credit or interest risk as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another mentioned that the president of his bank instructed loan 
  contact officers not to be aggressive in seeking loans. All three 
  banks have been making term loans based on a floating rate or a 
  periodic reappraisal that allows for rate adjustments.
