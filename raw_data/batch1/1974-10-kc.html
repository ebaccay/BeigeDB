       Tenth District firms are now facing less of a "sellers' market" for 
materials inputs than they did only a few months ago. Supplies are 
more readily available, and price increases are moderating somewhat. 
With business weakening, inventory growth is being watched more 
carefully and purchasing policy is becoming less aggressive. In 
agriculture, concern over frost-damaged crops and the possibility of 
export controls have created uncertainty over future feed costs, but 
the picture for profits in the livestock industry and for food 
prices remains gloomy. Loan demand at Tenth District commercial 
banks is holding up fairly well, with business and consumer 
installment loans up, and farm loans and loans to financial 
institutions down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Results of a survey of purchasing managers in the Tenth District 
suggest some easing in both the availability and prices of 
materials. These tendencies are not evident across the board, as 
some industries and some commodities are still faced with short 
supplies. The contrast with only a few months ago is evident, 
however, with a significant number of respondents now reporting 
shortening lead times, improved availability, some moderating in the 
number and degree of price increases, and a lessening in the use of 
allocations. As a result, several firms report that they are 
pursuing a less aggressive purchasing policy. Inventory accumulation 
targets are also being reduced in some instances. There is a 
definite indication that part of the change is due to current and 
anticipated slowdowns in demand for these firms' output.
      </p>
      <p>
       Textiles, corrugated paper, and some chemicals were specifically 
listed as being more readily available to purchasers. The supply 
situation for iron and steel does not show as much improvement as 
for other goods. .A major manufacturer of off road vehicles reports 
very little improvement in either availability or lead times of many 
important items. Other firms, however, do report some slight easing 
in steel with allocations larger and lead times down a little. One 
respondent reported that reinforcing bars and mesh have become much 
easier to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       With certain exceptions-mainly in metals-the purchasing managers are 
leaning toward a less aggressive purchasing policy. For example, one 
respondent said his firm was no longer "taking everything we can 
get, as was the case six months ago." All of them seem to be keeping 
a close watch on their inventories, with an eye to paring them down 
in light of a weakening business situation. At the same time, the 
experience with shortages and allocations appears to be pushing up 
the level of what is viewed as "normal" real accumulation. Inventory 
reductions will be selective and cautious; one respondent says his 
firm is "comfortable with most of the excess."
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of respondents believe themselves to be facing less of 
a "sellers' market" than in the recent past. Although prices 
generally are still rising, increases apparently are somewhat 
smaller and less frequent and cover fewer items. (Two makers of 
steel products noted that prices in the "gray" market have fallen 
sharply.) A firmer stand by purchasing agents is credited with 
having some effect on the price situation. Yet price at time of 
shipment seems to be more the rule than the exception. Moderation in 
price increases is not universally reported, however. A tire 
manufacturer reports "terrible price increases (for materials) in 
the past 90 days," with more expected to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reversing a recent trend, farm prices declined 2 percent for the 
month ended September 15, with cattle, hogs, soybeans, and corn 
contributing most to the decrease. However, growing concern over the 
frost-damaged crops in much of the corn belt has resulted in 
significantly stronger grain prices since mid-September, portending 
another year of high feed costs for livestock producers and rising 
food prices for the consumer unless various measures are taken to 
slow export demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even assuming export controls and a decline in grain prices, profits 
in the livestock industry will likely remain small for the next 
several months. Hog producers are responding by reducing farrowings 
and liquidating brood-sows while cattle feeders are increasing the 
culling rates for cows. Since adjustments proceed more slowly in the 
cattle industry, beef supplies should remain adequate through 1975, 
but pork supplies are likely to be off substantially, pushing prices 
up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the District, the planting of the new winter wheat crop is 
progressing well. Most of the seeded acreage in the southern half of 
the region has germinated and is growing. Moisture conditions are 
generally excellent, although parts of western and central Kansas, 
where some wheat was "planted in the dust," need rain to assure a 
stand. Rain also is needed in Nebraska where the wheat is now being 
seeded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District bankers contacted this month were divided in their 
opinions about the strength of loan demand but in general they 
thought demand was holding up fairly well. Reports indicate that 
consumer installment and business loans continue to increase, but 
farm loans and loans to financial institutions have declined. Some 
of the decline in farm loan demand is due to liquidation of 
inventories by cattlemen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the bankers surveyed indicated there has been some 
tightening of loan policies, such as a reluctance to make term 
loans. It appears that tighter loan policies have been selectively 
applied. Loans to new customers have been discouraged. Also, term 
loans are being discouraged to avoid being locked into present 
interest rates in case interest rates should rise in the future.
