       The slowing in the Sixth District economy appears to be spreading. 
Residential construction remains depressed. Layoffs and plant 
closings are more numerous. Loan delinquencies and business failures 
are noticeable in many areas. Postponements and cancellations of 
industrial and commercial projects continue to occur. Directors 
report that price-cutting by retailers and bargain- or sale-buying 
by consumers, as well as downgrading of purchases, have now become a 
common practice. Shortages have eased significantly in many parts of 
the District. Below is a state-by-state rundown on economic 
conditions in the Sixth District.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alabama: As in other states, residential construction is weak but, 
at least in central Alabama, commercial construction seems to be 
holding up well. Unemployment is not as severe as nationally (a 4.6
percent rate in September), but layoffs are increasing, particularly 
in industries related to housing. A pipe manufacturer has laid off 
375 workers, while a castings manufacturer has furloughed 600 
workers. The lumber industry has been most severely hit; demand for 
lumber is practically nonexistent, and many industry layoffs have 
occurred. One lumber dealer has been trying to sell 25 percent below 
market price and still cannot find a buyer. Several industrial 
projects have been canceled. Most notable is the possibility that 
the proposed $2.7-billion uranium enrichment plant near Dothan, 
Alabama, will not be built for lack of long-term financing. Price 
cuts in autos and tires were reported, and many items are only 
moving during sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Florida: Jacksonville and South Florida seem to be holding their own 
so far, but Tampa-St. Petersburg and central Florida have been 
severely affected by the current economic decline. Tourism is 
holding up pretty well in South Florida. Delinquency rates are 
increasing in central Florida and Tampa-St. Petersburg, according to 
one banker. Many of the delinquencies are from old customers who 
normally pay their bills promptly. In central Florida, several 
wholesale appliance dealers and electrical and plumbing contractors 
have closed their doors, and a few have filed bankruptcy. Among 
those filing are a major truck rental and leasing firm and one of 
Florida's oldest and best-known families in the citrus industry. One 
of the largest cement firms in South Florida has put 50 of its 
largest trucks in mothballs, and it is laying off a large number of 
workers. Florida Power Company has furloughed 5 percent of its work 
force. Mobile home sales are down by as much as 50 percent, and many 
workers have been laid off. Businessmen report shortages easing in 
areas related to construction such as timber and cement, but 
shortages remain in petroleum-base products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Georgia: This state's economy has sagged, with construction-related 
industries taking the brunt of the slowdown. Bankruptcies are up 50 
percent in Georgia and Greater Atlanta from a year ago. Motels, 
mobile home companies, bars, and restaurants have been hardest hit. 
Consumer bankruptcies are up but not as much as for businesses. 
Textile manufacturing plants are cutting their workweek back to four 
days. Office space is becoming oversupplied in Atlanta. It is 
rumored that two partially completed office buildings are stopping 
construction. A $4.5-million plant, which manufactures door units, 
was recently completed. The opening has been shelved for eighteen 
months to two years because of the decline in construction. The coal 
strike could severely affect Georgia's economy. Georgia Power 
Company relies on coal for 80 percent of its electrical supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Louisiana: Economic conditions in this state are mixed. The 
agricultural picture is one of a bumper soybean crop and 
skyrocketing sugar cane prices, which have boosted farm incomes. 
Cotton yields are below normal, however; and livestock producers are 
in a severe squeeze as they are everywhere. The timber industry is 
doing poorly in Louisiana as well as in other southeastern states; 
timber prices have dropped off 50 percent since February. Several 
cutbacks of capital spending plans have occurred. One oil company 
has postponed their previously announced $60-million construction 
program because of cost escalations which would make the present 
cost $145 million. One large industry recently decided not to locate 
in central Louisiana because of a lack of natural gas. Commercial 
and industrial construction is doing well, however, in other parts 
of Louisiana. The largest shopping mall in Louisiana, and the tenth 
largest in the country, is being built in Baton Rouge at an 
estimated cost of $50 million. Several chemical plants have 
announced multimillion-dollar expansion plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mississippi: This state, with its large agricultural base, has been 
least affected by the current economic decline. The state's 
unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in September, up only slightly 
from the year-ago 3.7-percent rate. Cotton and soybeans are now 
being harvested and will be larger than the 1973 crops. This year's 
pecan crop, also being harvested now, will be off somewhat from last 
year. Commercial and industrial construction remains healthy. A new 
shopping center is being built in Jackson. At least two new chemical 
plants have been announced, and a new paper products plant will be 
built in the Meridian area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee: Reports of price-shading and budget-buying have been 
received from many parts of the state. Of course, autos are selling 
at discount prices, but other items also are moving only at sale 
prices. One Tennessee businessman stated that two years ago he was 
given a bid price of $85,000 on construction of a new office 
building. Recently, five bids were received for the same job, and 
the contractor who bid $85,000 two years ago was awarded the 
contract at the low bid of $65,000. Tennessee retailers are noticing 
a significant shift in the downgrading of purchasing by their 
customers. One businessman notes that the average customer is 
shopping more and more in the budget sections of the department 
stores rather than in the regular merchandise lines. Shortages have 
lessened in most parts of the state, except for fertilizers, 
antifreeze, and farm machinery. Job layoffs have been increasing. A 
large bicycle manufacturer is laying off 1,500 workers; a television 
maker is closing down operations for two weeks. There is fear that 
the curtailment of natural gas to east Tennessee may force the 
closing of some plants in that area. Tourism, which is doing well 
throughout the state, is one of the few bright spots in the state's 
economy. Instances of capital spending curtailments were reported by 
Tennessee directors. The development of three major shopping centers 
has been delayed because of financing costs and other difficulties. 
A large apparel manufacturer in middle Tennessee has delayed 
completing a $1.2-million plant after already spending $400,000.
A 
$55-million expansion program announced by a Tennessee engineering 
company has been delayed because customers are now asking for later 
delivery of equipment already ordered.
