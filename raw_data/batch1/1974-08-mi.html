      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

       August 14, 1974
      </strong>

      <p>
       The prospects for the District economy are not as promising as 
earlier in the year. A price-cost squeeze is still hurting the 
District livestock industry, and dry weather is expected to reduce 
crop yields markedly. District consumer spending has softened 
recently, and no substantial sales pickup is foreseen. Tourist 
business is good in the eastern part of the District, but is 
sluggish in the western states. Savings inflows to District 
financial institutions have slowed as large investors have sought 
higher yielding investment opportunities. District loan demand is 
expected to remain strong at both rural and urban banks.
      </p>
      <p>
       District livestock producers have sustained substantial losses and 
are expected to do so until the price-cost situation improves. 
Bankers report much refinancing of feeder-cattle loans. However, 
District livestock producers appear to be getting the credit they 
need, and the Bank is not aware of any bankruptcies in this industry 
in the District. The pricing problem in the cattle industry is 
rapidly reverberating from the feedlot owner to cow-calf operators, 
many of whom are still holding their 1973 calves. For the cow-calf 
rancher, the full impact of the high grain prices will probably be 
felt later this fall. A Montana director indicated that there are 
currently no buyers for feeder cattle in his area because buyers are 
holding back, given current uncertainties about feed and cattle 
prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the situation was undoubtedly improved by recent rains, dry 
weather is expected to lessen District crop yields noticeably. 
Within the District, South Dakota is experiencing the most severe 
drought conditions, and a lack of moisture is also a serious problem 
in North Dakota and Montana. With the exception of the southwestern 
corner, crop yields in Minnesota, on the other hand, should be quite 
good.
      </p>
      <p>
       The prospect of reduced crop yields points toward some softening in 
District consumer spending, especially in the District's rural 
areas. However, if farm commodity prices remain high, business 
should be quite good in the areas where crops are satisfactory. 
Directors generally looked for some slowdown in retail sales growth 
throughout the District in the second half of 1974, and a North 
Dakota director described people in his area as "scared". In fact, a 
director's remarks indicate that District retail spending has 
already slowed. One director stated his area's retailers are not 
breaking their old records as in the past, and two other directors 
reported a softening in large appliance and furniture sales. Also, 
an upper peninsula of Michigan director states his area's consumers 
were being more cautious in their spending and slower in paying 
their bills. In Montana, on the other hand, a director indicated 
consumer spending has held up quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The tourist situation in the District is mixed. Directors from 
Minnesota and the upper peninsula report good tourist business, but 
directors from the western states indicated that their tourist 
business is slow. Total attendance at the Minneapolis Aquatennial, 
for example, was as good, if not better, than any prior festival 
year. A Montana director, on the other hand, stated that the tourist 
business in his state was down from 5 to 20 percent in various areas 
and would have been worse if it were not for Expo in Spokane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although savings inflows have slowed, directors generally reported 
that their area's financial institutions were holding their own. One 
director indicated that much of the "hot" money left his bank last 
year and the time deposits his bank currently is attracting are not 
as sensitive to interest rate movements. Another director stated 
that savings deposits have continued to increase at his bank. 
Nevertheless, most directors reported that large savers have 
withdrawn funds from their area's financial institutions and 
invested these funds in higher yielding alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Respondents to our latest agricultural credit conditions survey 
reported that no letup is expected in the strong loan demand 
experienced by District agricultural banks in the second quarter. 
Eighteen percent of the respondents reduced or refused a loan in the 
second quarter, and 20 percent expect to have problems meeting loan 
requests in the next three months. Factors contributing to this 
continued strong loan demand are a reduction in the availability of 
merchant credit, increased prices of farm inputs, the continued need 
to refinance feeder-cattle loans, and the expected need to finance 
wheat inventories. Also, the absence of Government payments this 
summer has increased loan demand: previously Government funds were 
used to cover mid-year operating expenses and pay off bank loans. 
Loan demand is also very strong at urban banks, and a twin cities 
banker reported that his bank is allocating loan funds among 
customers and has a flat prohibition against commitments to other 
than traditional customers. This bank looks for its loan demand to 
continue very high in the months ahead.
