      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The gradual improvement in business conditions indicated in recent 
months by observations of Second District directors and other 
business leaders remains in evidence. According to our respondents, 
the retail sales picture continued to improve in August and early 
September, and some retailers reported they were now understocked in 
some lines. Business capital spending, however, remains weak. The 
weakening of business loan demand in the District appears to have 
abated, and most loan officers contacted recently looked for a 
pickup in demand in the near future. The strengthening of the dollar 
on the foreign exchange market in general was believed to be likely 
to have little impact on U. S. trade.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Perhaps the brightest spot in the current economic situation has 
been continued improvement in the retail sales picture. The 
president of a nationwide chain of department stores reported that 
his firm had cashed many Federal income tax rebate checks. While 
this suggested that a large part of the rebates was spent rather 
than saved, the retailer anticipated consumer demand for general 
merchandise to continue to rise well into 1976. He reported that his 
company, which had experienced a large inventory overhang a few 
months ago, was now understocked in apparel lines. Retail sales in 
upstate New York, which already had been picking up in recent 
months, improved further in August, and resort areas were reported 
to have had a very good tourist season. Although retail sales in New 
York City continued to lag behind the nationwide performance, 
reflecting in part the high rate of unemployment in the city, sales 
at large department stores showed the best improvement since 
September 1974. This improvement, moreover, appears to have 
continued in early September. Merchants were generally optimistic 
and reported very good business over the Labor Day holiday, when 
many large department stores remained open. An even better 
performance was shown over the past month at stores in the suburbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the darker side, business spending on plant and equipment 
apparently remains weak. For example, the president of the 
department store mentioned above saw no evidence of a reactivation 
of capital spending plans in his industry, noting that the current 
emphasis was on increasing the productivity of existing facilities 
rather than on expansion. The chairman of a multinational oil 
company stated that business capital spending in general appeared to 
be lower than had been expected last spring. He reported that his 
own firm had cut its investment plans for 1975 by $100 million 
before the year began and by another $300 million in January because 
of deteriorating profits. The Buffalo Branch Directors also saw no 
evidence of a reactivation of capital spending plans that had 
previously been shelved, with one director citing continued excess 
capacity, escalating building costs, and relatively high interest 
rates as factors inhibiting capital spending. An upstate banker in a 
resort area, however, reported on plans for expansion of tourist 
facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of respondents expressed concern over a possible resurgence 
of inflation. Among others, the president of a large nonferrous 
metal firm stated he was "fearful" about inflation. He pointed to 
the currently low price/cost ratio in his industry and to the large 
proportion of capital spending for environmental protection adding 
nothing to productive capacity. These factors, he felt, would put 
upward pressure on materials prices. The chairman of the oil company 
felt that the current spending pattern, with consumers' outlays 
rising while business capital spending was not, could well have 
inflationary implications. And the Buffalo Branch Directors believed 
that fear of a resurgence of inflation was a major factor behind 
businessmen's currently cautious mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the demand for business loans, the Buffalo Branch 
Directors reported no further weakening in such demand, as did the 
majority of the loan officers at commercial banks in and outside New 
York City who were contacted recently. Moreover, nearly two-thirds 
of these loan officers expected loan demand to be stronger over the 
coming months, with virtually all others anticipating no change.
      </p>
      <p>
       We recently asked our directors and other respondents about their 
opinions regarding the possible impact on United States foreign 
trade stemming from the strengthening of the dollar on the exchange 
markets. Most respondents felt that this impact would be negligible. 
They agreed that this strengthening had not significantly eroded the 
competitiveness of U. S. exports to date, and was not likely to do 
so in the future, and that imports would not be spurred 
significantly. In their opinion, U. S. prices of goods continue to 
be attractive vis-a-vis those of foreign goods because of the 
greater rates of inflation experienced by many other countries. A 
senior economist at a large New York City bank stated that the 
strength of the dollar in recent months was only a rebound from an 
undervalued position. The present rate in his view is nearer the 
equilibrium rate and is more desirable over the longer run. The 
chairman of the oil company thought that the strengthening of the 
dollar should make OPEC countries less aggressive in raising oil 
prices this fall. The president of the nonferrous metal concern, 
however, believed the stronger dollar to have been a factor in the 
increase in aluminum and stainless steel imports.
