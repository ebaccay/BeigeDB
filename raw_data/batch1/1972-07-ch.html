       Business optimism is growing stronger in the Seventh District, and 
the view that the economy is in a vigorous expansion seems 
widespread. It appears to be taken for granted that this expansion 
will continue at least through the first half of 1973. Firms 
continue to report they need higher prices because of upward 
pressures on costs, but they are constrained by the Price Commission 
and competition. Companies are cautious about adding to payrolls, 
and most are planning to hold employment stable or to raise it only 
modestly. The pattern is similar in inventories, with most firms 
intending to hold inventory increases to moderate amounts. Restraint 
is less pronounced in the capital spending area, with most companies 
planning to boost capital spending this year. The demand for 
commercial and industrial loans is moderately strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Increased optimism, evident from conversations with individual 
businessmen, was the general theme of the speakers at a recent 
annual Business Outlook Conference which drew attendance from all 
over the District. The primary difference of opinion among the 
speakers discussing the overall outlook was with regard to the 
second half of 1973. For that period, forecasts ranged from 
incipient recession to continued, even accelerating, growth. 
Virtually all commentators expected higher interest rates by the end 
of 1972, particularly short-term rates, and that rates would hold at 
these higher levels or climb further in 1973.
      </p>
      <p>
       In specific areas in which detailed forecasts were made, the outlook 
presented for plant and equipment expenditures was the most 
optimistic. It was predicted that a capital spending boom was now in 
its initial stages and would show no significant signs of tapering 
off until early 1974. Forecasters predicted auto sales for 1972 to 
be 10.6 million units, and that 1973 would see a slightly higher 
level, with domestic manufacturers holding on to the gains in market 
share which have been evident in recent months. The forecast for 
housing was for a general slowing down, but with starts still 
exceeding 2 million units this year and only slightly below that 
level in 1973. Continued but slower growth was forecast for the 
mobile home market. The outlook presented for retail sales—other
than autos—also was strong. However, the expectation was that this 
strength would be concentrated in durable goods. Nondurables would 
show little gain except for that resulting from price increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The participation of District producers of capital goods in the 
improvement seems to have broadened in the last month. Increases in 
sales are beginning to be noted in heavy construction equipment and 
over-the-road trailers—trends not evident earlier in the year. The 
one capital goods area reporting no sign of improvement was railroad 
cars. A local manufacturer reported that if it were not for a small 
order received in January, they would have closed down everything 
except repair operations. This firm has not received enough requests 
for quotations to give them any hope of significant improvement 
before the last quarter of the year, if then.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the various consumer durable products, sales of recreational 
vehicles at both the retail and manufacturing levels have been very 
strong. One area manufacturer reported that his company's sales were 
nearly double last year's, and that shipping facilities to meet 
promised deliveries were becoming a bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strikes by various crafts have slowed construction in the Chicago 
area. The elevator constructors' strike was concluded July 9 after 
100 days, and short strikes by the masons and carpenters have caused 
delays on several major projects, with one major building now about 
three months behind schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
       Livestock prices continue at exceptionally high levels in response 
to strong consumer demand. Although meat supplies will be increasing 
seasonally over the next several months, recent estimates of 
livestock numbers have caused many observers to expect only modest 
price declines during the remainder of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crop conditions generally are reported "excellent" across the 
Midwest, suggesting a near record fall harvest. Nevertheless, crop 
prices generally are near their highs for the year. The pending 
grain agreement with Russia (announced over the weekend) has 
provided considerable support to the market. Settlement of the dock 
strike in Japan would provide further support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversations with bankers in this District suggest that the demand 
for commercial and industrial loans is moderately strong, but there 
is no indication that an upsurge is developing. Except in Detroit, 
where demand has been sluggish all spring and remains so, the banks 
that were reporting the strongest demand earlier have experienced 
some weakening recently, while the others seem to be doing better. 
Borrowing over the June tax date generally was less than had been 
expected, and lack of inventory building is widely mentioned as a 
source of weakness. Competition for loans appears to be very strong 
among bankers, and we hear many comments that national customers are 
staying in the commercial paper market. We have heard a number of 
comments from banks about the aggressive operations of the largest 
Chicago banks via "cap" term loans. While loanable funds are still 
generally adequate, the major Chicago banks added substantially to 
their outstanding CD's last month, and one bank indicates that it 
may have to seek CD money much more aggressively if inventory 
investment is stepped up as expected.
