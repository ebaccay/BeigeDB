       Second District directors and other business leaders who were 
recently contacted generally welcomed the phasing out of wage and 
price controls. The respondents continued to see strength in 
business capital spending. Apart from automobiles and some other 
consumer durables, retail sales seem to be stronger than expected, 
but some retailers appear to be rather cautious in their sales 
expectations. The recent rise in business inventories does not 
appear to have resulted from weak sales-excepting large-size 
automobiles-but rather was attributed primarily to precautionary 
purchases by businesses against expectations of further price 
increases and shortages.
      </p>
      <p>
       The respondents generally indicated that the time had come to 
eliminate wage and price controls. Some directors did expect the 
phasing out of controls to bring about a short-term spurt in 
inflation, but felt that such a move on balance would have a 
positive psychological effect on businessmen's decision-making, and 
that over the longer term market forces would correct supply-demand 
imbalances. The sentiment that controls were contributing to these 
imbalances was expressed by several other respondents. Among these, 
the chairman of a large multinational oil corporation noted that 
while controls had been in effect for over two and one half years, 
they had failed to bring inflation under control, but had created 
uncertainties and contributed to shortages of various products. He 
felt that their removal would improve the business climate and 
probably help avoid a serious contraction in business activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The respondents in general expected the sizable planned increase for 
1974 in business plant and equipment outlays to be largely 
implemented. A New York City banker thus noted that many industries 
will continue to operate close to capacity even during a mild 
recession, and will require additional capacity to meet demand in 
the next period of expansion. The view that capacity shortages would 
stimulate capital investments was also expressed by the chairman of 
a large oil corporation, who noted, that petroleum industry capital 
spending was expected to rise sharply to help meet the country's 
energy need. An upstate banker similarly looked for increased demand 
for energy-related capital equipment, while another upstate banker 
felt that the current shift toward smaller cars in the automobile 
industry would require major plant and equipment expenditures. The 
president of a large nationwide retail chain felt that recent 
economic developments should have no significant impact on business 
spending plans. He noted that in the retail industry (and presumably 
many other industries) capital spending decisions are made far in 
advance of actual outlays, leaving little flexibility to respond to 
changes in the short-term economic outlook. Some respondents, 
however, while in general expecting continued strength in capital 
outlays, did express some reservations regarding businessmen's 
ability to implement fully their plans because of materials 
shortages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning consumer spending, the president of the retail chain 
mentioned above reported that his firm's sales in February had 
slightly exceeded expectations, in both store and catalog 
operations, but that the firm was maintaining a cautious attitude 
over the sales outlook because of the potential problems facing the 
economy over the next several months. A New York City banker, while 
characterizing retail sales as "fairly good", pointed to the decline 
in auto sales and to signs of slippage in appliance and lower-priced 
furniture sales. One observer noted, however, that appliance sales 
have been exceeding some manufacturers' expectations. The chairman 
of a drug manufacturing firm, moreover, felt the retail sales 
picture remained strong, while another respondent reported that his 
contacts at a large New York City department store characterized 
business as "booming".
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of respondents reported some changes in consumers buying 
habits. The Buffalo branch directors felt that on the one hand 
inflation was promoting anticipatory buying, but that at the same 
time, consumers were constrained by the fact that prices were rising 
faster than incomes. One director pointed to increased emphasis on 
utilitarian purchases and decreased emphasis on "frill" items. On 
the other hand, the chairman of a major nationwide food processing 
firm reported a surprising upgrading of quality in consumers' 
purchases. A retailer reported that owing to the gasoline shortage, 
consumers seem to be concentrating their grocery, clothes, dry 
cleaning, and most other shopping at one time-mainly on Saturdays.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the view of most respondents, large-size automobiles were about 
the only sector where weak sales seem to have accounted for the 
recent build-up in inventories. Most felt that inflation and fear of 
scarcities were important factors in the recent increase. An upstate 
banker reported that inventory financing at his bank was at an all 
time high, and saw evidence that some businesses were buying 
whatever they could now, in anticipation of more serious future 
shortages. A New York banker also mentioned evidence of growing 
speculative inventory building because of fears of further price 
increases or of continued shortages. He and several other 
respondents, however, reported that businessmen in general felt 
their inventory positions to be in reasonable balance with sales, 
except for shortages of a number of materials. In this context, it 
was noted that in some instances, shortages of certain items 
prevented some firms from converting a substantial part of their 
present inventories into marketable products.
