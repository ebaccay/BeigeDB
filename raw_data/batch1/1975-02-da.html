      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The volume of loans outstanding at Eleventh District banks has 
  fallen sharply since the first of the year. Business loans have 
  experienced the steepest decline, but real estate loans, loans to 
  nonbank financial institutions, and consumer loans have all been 
  reduced substantially. District bankers report the decline in 
  business lending is primarily due to reduced loan demand. But 
  apparently loan officers are being more selective, also. For 
  example, marginal loan requests, which would have been accepted a 
  year ago, are now being turned down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory loans have fallen sharply as many firms have successfully 
  drawn down materials stocks in line with lower sales. Demand for 
  accounts receivable financing has also declined with sales. Even 
  loans for petroleum and gas operations, which had increased nearly a 
  third in the past year, have dropped. However, rather than 
  reflecting reduced oil field activity, lower loan demand by oil 
  companies has been a result of higher profits, allowing these firms 
  to finance a larger portion of their explorations internally.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business demand for term financing, on the other hand, is up 
  substantially. Many companies that financed capital expansions 
  partially with short-term loans last year are now trying to 
  refinance these outlays on a long-term basis. In addition, bankers 
  report heavy demand from durable goods manufacturers for term loans 
  needed to finance replacement equipment. However, most requests to 
  refinance existing loans are being rejected because bankers are 
  reluctant to commit funds to long-term obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for real estate loans remains weak. In fact, as described by 
  one banker, demand for interim construction financing is "virtually 
  nonexistent." Meanwhile, an increased flow of funds to thrift 
  institutions has resulted in reduced borrowing by nonbank financial 
  institutions. Requests for consumer loans have also declined 
  substantially as households are deferring purchases of many big 
  ticket items.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan renewals at District banks have risen sharply. Renewals by 
  commercial real estate companies have been particularly large. Many 
  of these firms are "totally illiquid," according to one banker, 
  since they have been unable to resell large holdings of nonincome 
  producing land. In manufacturing, loan renewals are most common in 
  construction-related industries and among firms engaged in supplying 
  producers of consumer durables. In an attempt to hedge against 
  shortages and rising prices last year, many of these companies 
  stockpiled inventories. But because sales fell sharply, they have 
  been unable to liquidate inventories and pay out existing 
  obligations. Heavy renewals of loans to individuals for purchase of 
  stock have also been reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of large commercial banks in the District reveals that most 
  lenders have recently increased reserves for covering loan defaults. 
  higher profits earned last year provided the chief source of funds 
  to increase loss reserves. And bankers admit that the economic 
  outlook for 1975 practically ensures higher loan losses.
     </p>
     <p>
      A downturn in business activity in the District has caused a rapid 
  deterioration in the labor market. Growth in total employment has 
  come to a virtual standstill, while the labor force continues to 
  expand. The result has been a sharp rise in unemploymentâ€”25 percent 
  in 2 months. And the unemployment rate stands at 6.2 percent, up 
  from 4.7 percent last fall. Layoffs in manufacturing, particularly 
  in durable goods industries, account for much of the increase in 
  unemployment. And barometers of future labor market strength 
  indicate this downward trend will continue. In Texas, the average 
  workweek in manufacturing has fallen to 40.2 hours, after remaining 
  at 40.6 hours for 6 months. Moreover, initial claims for 
  unemployment insurance have doubled since last fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Grain and soybean production is expected to rise substantially this 
  year in the Eleventh District states. An increase in acreage planted 
  will help boost winter wheat production nearly 50 percent over last 
  year. Because of low cotton prices, farms will reduce total cotton 
  acreage by 25 percent, and most of this land will be put into the 
  production of soybeans and grain sorghum. As a result, total soybean 
  acreage will increase 28 percent, while grain sorghum acreage will 
  be up 18 percent. The amount of land planted in rice will be 
  essentially unchanged.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cattle producers continue to face a bleak profit picture. Ranchers, 
  reluctant to cull their herds at depressed market prices, are 
  finding it unprofitable to winter a large number of cattle. The 
  number of cattle on feed in District feedlots continues to fall, 
  down 40 percent from a year ago. Consequently, most feedlots are 
  operating well below their break-even level of production, and 
  several of the largest feedlots have gone into bankruptcy.
     </p>
     <p>
      While bankers generally report no serious financial difficulties due 
  to the write-off of farm loans, they indicate the number of 
  delinquent loans has risen. Renewals of loans to livestock producers 
  are common, and referrals to the Farmers Home Administration have 
  increased. Bankers are reviewing agricultural loan requests closely 
  with the view that livestock loans will continue to be risky in 
  1975. And with grain markets weakening, bankers are very concerned 
  that crop farmers may experience a severe cost price squeeze by 
  harvest season.
