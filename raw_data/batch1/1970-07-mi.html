      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 15, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The softening in the Ninth Federal Reserve District which has been 
evident since early this year appears to have continued through 
June. Almost universally, district directors, bank officers and 
leading businessmen felt that district unemployment rose in June and 
that students were finding either less lucrative summer jobs than in 
previous years or none at all. Consistent with this deterioration in 
employment, consumer tendency to downgrade purchases is continuing. 
At the same time, price shading, especially among retailers, is 
becoming more prevalent while business failures appear to be on an 
upswing.
     </p>
     <p>
      District newspapers in recent weeks have contained numerous articles 
reporting that labor markets have softened appreciably in their 
local areas. These articles were corroborated by the observations of 
the Minneapolis Bank's Directors and officers who are able to cite 
specific examples of softening. First, job applications are 
substantially greater than usual; moreover, many applicants have 
considerable experience and technical skills. Second, some 
electrical contractors in the twin cities have gone to a 4-day week 
in order to spread the work. Third, unemployment in the rural areas 
of the district is rising, partially because people who had left for 
higher paying jobs in Metropolitan areas are now returning after 
having been laid off.
     </p>
     <p>
      The softer labor market conditions have resulted in fewer summer job 
opportunities for students this year than in the past few years. The 
two reasons that were most often cited for this lack of job 
opportunities were that construction and tourism, the two major 
activities in the district where students usually find work, are 
operating at lower levels than in the past few years; and a number 
of employers who are facing squeezes on profits and liquidity are 
not hiring summer help as freely as they did in previous summers.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of additional cases which indicate that consumers are 
downgrading the quality of their purchases have come to our 
attention in the past month. Directors from areas in the district 
where tourism is a major industry all report that tourist spending 
is down significantly from a year ago. At the same time, however, 
traffic seems to be about the same as it was last year. Instead of 
spending money and attending paying attractions, people are relying 
more on free accommodations and are traveling with campers rather 
than staying in motels. Meanwhile, repair shops for automobiles and 
other durable goods are reporting record volumes of business; a 
regional parts distribution center for a major automobile 
manufacturer in the twin cities reports that the demand for 
automobile parts is so great that its crews are working overtime. 
Although automobile sales in the district are still at depressed 
levels, the weakness seems to be centered on the more expensive 
models while the market for lighter, economy models and used autos 
appears to be relatively strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      The greatest evidence of "price shading" in the district is at the 
retail level. In addition to markdowns on automobiles, the directors 
felt that retailers were holding sales earlier than usual this 
summer and were offering larger discounts. One reason given for this 
was that inventories appear to be larger than desired because of the 
general slowing in retail sales. Retailers are also concerned that 
they will "get stuck" with merchandise that was ordered before the 
truckers' strike and is only now arriving.
     </p>
     <p>
      There appears to be very little "price shading" for industrial 
goods, and directors and officers of the bank cited a number of 
cases where prices have actually risen in the past few weeks. In 
general the feeling was that manufacturers do not have adequate 
margins with which to cut prices. As one director put it, "business 
is hurting but volume at a loss doesn't help." Another felt that 
industrial suppliers are beginning to drop unprofitable lines. On 
the other hand one director indicated that discounts in some 
construction materials are greater now than they were a year ago. He 
was careful to point out, however, that list prices have risen 
during the past year, and as a result, the net effect on prices is 
not clear. He noted that sales efforts among construction materials 
distributors have intensified, and that they have improved services 
including schedules in order to increase their sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      The slowing in sales along with a decreased availability of funds 
has led to an increase in district business failures. The three most 
common characteristics of failing businesses are that they were 
relatively young firms, were in industries in which entry is fairly 
easy, and/or were undercapitalized. Of the 21 failures of which one 
leading district banker was aware, all could be attributed to one or 
more of these factors. One director observed that the number of 
failures or near failures in the construction industry has risen in 
recent months. The primary cause for this is the lack of working 
capital, a problem which is chronic in the industry, but which has 
become increasingly acute because of the large number of recent 
strikes and the slowing in construction activity.
