      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 14, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      There is evidence that future growth in large CD's at Tenth District 
banks will be less. There are indications also that business loan 
demand may be easing slightly. The labor situation in the Kansas 
City area has worsened as the construction strike—now in its seventh 
month—continues and the General Motors strike prevails at several 
large GM assembly plants. The reduction in output of feed grains and 
high feed-grain prices is likely to have an impact on the WPI and 
CPI within several months. Instead of providing a downward pressure 
on these indices which occurred from March to August, farm prices 
may again exert upward pressure later this year or early next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those large District banks which have actively sought large CD's 
(many have not) have continued to attract substantial amounts of 
funds. Growth rates of outstanding CD's have been comparable to 
those at large banks in New York City and Chicago. One peculiarity 
in the Tenth District has been that a significant amount of CD funds 
have come from state and local governmental units—about one-third of 
the total growth in CD's. This source of funds would seem to be 
limited, so that future growth of CD's may slow.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the rapid growth of CD' s, most of the District banks so far 
have retained bank-affiliate commercial paper as a source of funds. 
One large Tulsa bank, however, is actively substituting CD's for its 
commercial paper. Most of the CD funds have been utilized by the 
banks to restore liquidity. Only a limited amount of the funds have 
gone into loan expansion. As a result, some banks are beginning to 
feel much more comfortable. One larger Denver bank this week reduced 
its CD rates below those in New York City to slow down the inflow of 
funds. This bank had been aggressively seeking CD's by offering 
rates above those in New York and had more than doubled its 
outstanding CD's over the past three months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business loan demand in the District is showing some signs of 
easing. In particular, business loans have not reflected any of the 
growth of CD's in those cities that had been squeezed for funds. 
Except that some loans have been transferred from parent holding 
companies back to the banks, there has been no noticeable pile up in 
loan requests following the reduction in the prime rate.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is little indication that the Tenth District economy is 
deviating significantly from national trends. There are a few signs 
of recovery but areas with significant problems remain. Aircraft 
production is low and the airline industry has substantial 
overcapacity because of a sharp slackening in the rate of growth. 
Airlines with large District installations are cooperating with 
other trunk carriers in an effort to get CAB approval to reduce 
flights on some highly competitive routes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction activity is reported to be moving upward at a rapid 
pace in Denver and some other District cities. In Kansas City, 
however, long construction strikes this year and last virtually 
halted construction activity and are resulting in highly 
inflationary wage settlements which hurt future prospects. Four of 
the seven striking construction worker locals signed contracts with 
the building contractors in late August. These agreements provided 
for the increases of about 100 percent over four years. One of the 
three remaining locals on strike, the Cement Masons, has recently 
rejected a four-year increase of 90 percent. This is explained by 
the fact that many of the Cement Masons are presently being employed 
by the heavy construction contractors at the wage levels determined 
a year ago which exceed the rejected offer made by the builders. 
Consequently, there is no strong incentive for them to settle the 
strike that started on April 1.
     </p>
     <p>
      The effects of the General Motors strike are adding to Kansas City's 
problems. It has added 8,000 idle workers to the 12,000 still out 
due to the construction strike. Kansas City led the nation last year 
in man days lost to strikes with 2.7 million and is leading again 
this year with 3.3 million lost due to the construction strike 
alone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Damage to the corn crop from blight and unfavorable weather 
conditions apparently is severe. Consequently, grain prices are 
likely to retain most of the gains of the past few months and may go 
higher. The reduction in output of feed grains and high grain prices 
will discourage the rapid expansion that has been occurring in meat 
production. This set of conditions may have a temporarily depressing 
effect on livestock prices, as fewer animals are withheld for 
breeding and perhaps some breeding stock liquidated. However, as the 
rate of expansion and slaughter weights decline, livestock prices 
are likely to increase, perhaps sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      The net effect of the anticipated changes suggests a bottoming-out 
of the decline in the index of prices received by farmers that has 
been occurring since March. It is probable that the index could 
again start rising late this year or early next year. To the extent 
that this evaluation is correct, farm prices may soon start exerting 
upward pressure on the WPI and CPI instead of being a retarding 
influence such as has been the case since February.
