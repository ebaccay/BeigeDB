      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Third District showed little change, on 
  average, during the past month. Area manufacturers report that their 
  new orders held steady and inventories were reduced further, but 
  employment was off slightly and price movements could be squeezing 
  profits. These businessmen continue to be optimistic, however, about 
  business conditions over the next two quarters. They expect new 
  orders to be up, inventories to be trimmed still more, and 
  workforces to be expanded. Nevertheless, capital spending plans 
  remain conservative, and higher prices are anticipated. Area 
  retailers report higher sales volumes but see no well-defined trends 
  yet. Bankers in the region are experiencing steady inflows of 
  savings deposits but still face flat loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Third District manufacturers, responding to this month's business 
  outlook survey, report steady overall business conditions, with 80 
  percent of those surveyed indicating no change in general business 
  activity over last month. Furthermore, there is some indication that 
  the economic slide has been arrested. During June, only 10 percent 
  of the respondents experienced declining business activity compared 
  to almost 60 percent last January. While new orders were 
  significantly higher in May, two-thirds of the executives surveyed 
  report no change during June. Moreover, inventory liquidation is 
  continuing with half of the manufacturers reporting lower stocks of 
  goods on hand. Respondents listing cutbacks in their workforces 
  still outnumber those reporting increases, but the length of the 
  workweek is holding steady, with almost 90 percent indicating no 
  change in the last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic outlook through the end of the year remains optimistic, 
  with more than 80 percent of those polled expecting an improvement 
  in business activity. Over two-thirds of these executives anticipate 
  an increase in new orders, and a bit more pruning of inventories is 
  expected. In addition, nearly half of these manufacturers expect to 
  add employees, and some lengthening in the average workweek is 
  foreseen. Despite the optimistic outlook, however, spending plans 
  for plant and equipment are still guarded. Almost two-thirds of the 
  manufacturers polled plan no change in capital expenditures by the 
  beginning of the Bicentennial year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area manufacturers report that they are currently paying higher 
  prices for their supplies but, on average, receiving lower prices 
  for their finished products. However, the bulk of these executives 
  expect the next six months to bring higher prices for both their 
  supplies and their finished products. In fact, none of the 
  manufacturers surveyed reported paying lower prices this month, and 
  none expect to be paying lower ones by next January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Merchants in the area report that retail sales are running slightly 
  ahead of their projections. While none of the retailers contacted 
  would ascribe very much of this to Federal tax rebates, one felt 
  that most of the improvement stemmed from some amelioration in 
  consumer attitudes toward spending. One retailer noted that his 
  stores sales forecasts were being revised in a somewhat more 
  optimistic vein through September, but another felt that no definite 
  trends were evident yet and that sales could go either way. All of 
  the merchants contacted report better delivery times for hard goods, 
  especially furniture. It is felt that backlogs have been worked 
  down, and with shorter delivery times, retailers expect to continue 
  their current conservative posture on inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail executives report significant moderation in the prices they 
  pay and a stabilizing trend in the prices they charge. One expects 
  to be paying substantially higher prices for man-made fibers but 
  does not see this hitting the consumer at the retail level for 
  another 6-8 months. These merchants look for prices to be climbing 
  at a 4-6 percent clip by year-end and do not expect the rate to 
  exceed 6 percent in 1976. They look for the economy to recover 
  gradually and the unemployment rate to come down only slowly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the District report steady inflows of savings but are 
  mixed in their experiences with demand deposits. The reports range 
  from "a good influx" to "somewhat disappointing." There is general 
  agreement that loan demand is still flat, and area bankers expect 
  level or slightly lower loan demand for the balance of the summer. 
  Most report that they are seeking short-term arrangements with new 
  customers and they are generally trying to shorten maturities in 
  their asset structure. One banker indicated relaxed constraints on 
  availability of funds at his bank but no easing in the price or 
  quality constraints for loans. There is little expectation that the 
  prime rate will go any lower, and all of the bankers contacted felt 
  that interest rates were near bottom. The rise in short-term rates 
  in late June received mixed interpretations. While some bankers saw 
  it as a definite tightening move by the Fed, others did not know 
  what to make of it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers expect the economy to recover gradually with interest 
  rates moving upward at a modest pace. In addition, there is little 
  anticipation of strong inflationary pressures during recovery. The 
  financial executives contacted expect inflation to stay in the 5-6 
  percent range through most of 1976. But there was some concern that 
  the Fed would be under political pressure next year to try to bring 
  down the unemployment rate more rapidly with the result that 
  inflation might be rekindled further down the road.
