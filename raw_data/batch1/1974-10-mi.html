      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

     <p>
      <strong>
       October 9, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       Although District business activity is currently stronger than in 
the nation, signs of weakness are emerging. The livestock industry's 
depressed condition combined with poor weather which has 
significantly cut crop production has made the prospects for farm 
income a primary concern. District retail sales so far this year 
have increased at faster rates than nationally, but retailers are 
uncertain about the future. However, District resort operators look 
for good business this winter. A lack of mortgage funds nationally 
has also hurt District homebuilding, but not as severely as in the 
nation. Business loan demand continues strong at District banks with 
no letup foreseen.
      </p>
      <p>
       After increasing very sharply in 1973 and 1974 the outlook for 
District farm income is not very encouraging. Early frosts in 
September combined with a wet spring and a dry summer have 
significantly reduced District crop yields. Although higher prices 
will offset part of the production decline, gross receipts from the 
District's 1974 harvest will probably be down slightly from 1973's 
level. Gross receipts from District livestock sales are also 
expected to be down from a year ago. The marketing of livestock this 
year will not be off significantly but prices are down considerably 
from a year ago. This softening in gross farm income comes at a time 
when farmers' production costs have been rising rapidly. 
Consequently, District net farm income is expected to weaken 
considerably in the last half of 1974 and into 1975.
      </p>
      <p>
       Relative gains in District retail sales have outpaced comparable 
increases in the nation so far this year, but retailers are 
concerned about the future. Much of the strength in District retail 
sales can be traced to large farm increases in 1973 and early 1974 
which have spurred retail spending outside of the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul Metropolitan Area. Discussions with District retailers have 
revealed that sales this summer were good. However, most admitted 
that higher prices accounted for a major part of their recent sales 
gains. Our contacts reported good sales of apparel and home 
improvement items and declines in big ticket merchandise such as 
furniture and major appliances. Freezers and similar items are in 
great demand and in very short supply. District retailers are 
cautious in assessing their fourth quarter sales outlook and some 
fear was expressed that this year's short Christmas shopping season 
might cut into their business.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automobile sales in July, August, and early September were 
exceptionally good, according to a survey of regional sales 
managers. Despite large sales in the last two months, cumulative 
sales for 1974 are still below those for 1973, however. On the other 
hand, truck sales continue to run well ahead of last year. The 
supplies of large luxury cars are very low in the District. Current 
inventories of smaller cars are greater than normal, but dealers say 
they are confident of selling them once the higher priced 1975 
models are on the market. Automobile dealers are worried about the 
impact of the 1975 model prices on their sales and that current high 
sales of 1974 models might cut into their future sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       District resorts reported a very good summer and look for business 
to remain good. An increase in business by local people and group 
vacationers this summer was noted by several resorts. They also 
reported that family groups stayed longer than in the past. With 
regard to their winter recreational business, resort owners are 
anticipating a very strong winter season and report that 
reservations are well ahead of last year's at this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction is off in the District but not as severely 
as in the nation. The number of housing units authorized in the 
District for the seven-month period ending in July was 9.5 percent 
lower than those for the same period a year ago, as compared to a 
38.4 percent decline nationally. Savings inflows have been off at 
District thrift institutions, and mortgage lending has declined. 
Mortgage loans made by Minneapolis and St. Paul S&amp;Ls in August were 
41 percent below the August 1973 level. Interest rates and nonprice 
terms of mortgage loans made by Twin Cities financial institutions 
have stiffened during the past three months. Despite a substantial 
cutback in recent months, outstanding loan commitments at District 
S&amp;Ls are at a high level due to the large volume of commitments 
made in early 1974 when savings inflows were unusually heavy and 
were expected to continue at a higher rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business loan demand continues strong at District banks and no letup 
is foreseen. Discussions with the three largest banks in the 
Minneapolis/St. Paul area indicate that they consider their loan 
demand strong and foresee no change over the near term. 
Consequently, these banks are raising interest rates and tightening 
other terms and conditions on new commitments. The outlook for loan 
demand at District rural areas will be largely influenced by farm 
income developments. Because of lower net incomes, spending on 
capital items and consumer durables will fall, resulting in lower 
loan demand for such purposes. However, refinancing needs will 
increase to cover production costs not met by the year's income. In 
addition, feeder cattle loans will be soft for some time, but 
ranchers may demand more credit to cover holding their cattle over 
the winter months.
