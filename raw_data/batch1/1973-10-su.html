      Beige Book: National Summary

      <strong>
       October 10, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The Redbook reports describe a very strong economy with widespread 
shortages of manpower and materials and substantial upward pressures 
on prices. Disintermediation at S&amp;Ls, usury rates, and generally 
tight money have drastically reduced the availability of mortgage 
funds, with the result that residential building activity is 
shrinking rapidly throughout the nation. Virtually all other major 
sectors, including nonresidential construction, remain vigorous with 
rising backlogs and stretching lead times on deliveries. Inventories 
of goods, especially raw materials, are lower than desired in most 
sectors. A wide range of materials and components are in critically 
short supply. As a result, expansion of output has been dampened 
and, in some cases, output has been curtailed. Investments in plant 
and equipment in virtually all industries are rising, and this trend 
is expected to continue well into 1974. Prospects for crops are 
generally very favorable. Reports on retail trade were mixed and 
inconclusive. Reports on credit demands also were mixed, but it is 
apparent that lenders have no difficulty finding profitable outlets 
for available funds.
       <p>
        Selected highlights of reports from each of the districts follows. 
Comments on the universally bleak residential construction picture 
are omitted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boston: Sales and orders of capital goods continue to rise at a 
rapid pace, but orders for consumer goods are "a little slower." 
Unemployment remains relatively high. Domestic capital goods orders 
are particularly vigorous for chemical processing equipment, machine 
tools, and aerospace. Foreign orders for capital goods are large. 
Views of four academic correspondents are presented.
       </p>
       <p>
        New York: Demand for materials and goods remains strong, but slower 
growth in overall activity is expected. Phase IV is termed a 
"disaster." Higher prices abroad are drawing away U. S. resources. 
Labor's wage demands are viewed as under "restraint." Scarcities 
have hampered attempts to build inventories of raw materials.
       </p>
       <p>
        Philadelphia: Plant and equipment investment plans have been raised. 
Employment is rising slowly and workweeks are lengthening. Delivery 
lead times have stretched out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cleveland: Shortages are "constraining" growth in output, and are 
judged to be the main cause of the recent slowing in the rise in 
general activity. Moreover, shortages have become more severe in 
recent weeks. Glass production lines have been shut down for lack of 
soda ash and increased supplies are a year or more away. Shortages 
of plastic materials are cutting production of various products. 
Foreign prices for plastic materials and for steel are well above 
U.S. prices. Most steel order books have been closed for the year. 
Inventories are low generally. Some retailers report slower sales. 
Labor turnover is high. Some firms are hoarding fuel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Richmond: Business activity continues to expand despite shortages of 
labor and materials. Paper, synthetic fibers, and chemicals are 
especially strong. Electrical components are in short supply. Phase 
IV is criticized. Retail sales remain strong. Nonresidential 
construction has been maintained. Volvo will locate a plant in 
Virginia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Atlanta: Only residential construction is down. Shortages have 
delayed construction projects. Commercial construction plans 
announced for the Atlanta area "dazzle the imagination." Industrial 
projects are being pushed in various parts of the South, and 
Japanese and European manufacturers are evaluating sites for new 
plants in the region. Shipyards are being expanded to handle the 
boom in tankers and bulk cargo carriers. Labor shortages are 
limiting phosphate mining. Shortages of shrimp and oysters are 
reported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chicago: Supplies of a broad range of basic materials are very tight 
with no improvement expected in the foreseeable future. Motor 
vehicle output has been limited by strikes and availability of 
components. Labor supplies are inadequate, both for skilled and 
trainable workers. Nonresidential construction has been delayed by 
shortages of materials. Shortages of steel, nonferrous metals, 
paper, fuels, chemicals, and plastics are holding down production of 
finished goods. New labor contracts may be more generous than 
suggested by announced increases in basic wages. Record crops of 
corn and soybeans are anticipated.
       </p>
       <p>
        St. Louis: Widespread shortages of raw materials are hampering 
output. Plants producing garments, appliances, and hardware are at 
capacity. Many firms report labor shortages, and unemployment is 
low. Crop conditions are "good to excellent."
       </p>
       <p>
        Minneapolis: Retail sales have "not yet let up" and further gains 
are expected. The outlook is for record crops. Shortages of 
materials, e.g., steel and plastics, are holding down output. The 
fertilizer shortage is "critical." Shortages of general laborers as 
well as skilled workers are reported, and labor turnover has 
increased.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kansas City: Recent floods have damaged property and delayed 
planting of winter wheat, but the overall impact probably will be 
"rather insignificant." Propane supplies needed to dry crops may not 
be adequate. Auto sales are very good, especially sales of compacts. 
Department store sales are strong. Lead times on consumer goods 
orders are long, but retail inventories are "as budgeted."
       </p>
       <p>
        Dallas: Employment reached a new high in August. Department store 
sales increased "rapidly" in September. The CLC's "two-tier" system 
has allowed prices of "new" crude to rise substantially above prices 
of "old" crude. Imported crude is high-priced. Fertilizer supplies 
are limited. Crops are generally "good to excellent" except for a 
large decline in rice yields.
       </p>
       <p>
        San Francisco: Housing is the only sector showing a decline. Both 
business and consumer spending remain strong. Investments by 
electronics, fertilizer, and chemicals firms are at high levels. 
Boeing has received additional orders. Farmers are spending freely. 
Power shortages have caused cutbacks in usage in Oregon. The housing 
decline has reduced demand for lumber and cement. Drought cut wheat 
output in the Northwest.
