      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite a steady decline in mining output since November 1973, 
  industrial production in Texas has recovered to a level near the 
  pre-recession peak. Manufacturing output has more than made up for 
  the ground lost during the recession. The recovery in output, 
  however, has largely been centered in the production of nondurable 
  goods. Output of chemicals, oil refining, and apparel has fully 
  recovered, while paper production has been slower in recovering. In 
  durable goods production, which has not fully recovered, the 
  strongest industries are fabricated metals and nonelectrical 
  machinery. The weakest continues to be primary metals.
     </p>
     <p>
      This month's survey found no production bottlenecks of consequence, 
  and factory inventories were at manageable levels. Manufacturers 
  look to improved business conditions but at the same time remain 
  reluctant in most industries to expand production capacity beyond 
  what they now have or what is currently under construction. Their 
  major concern is the future strength of the recovery, but also 
  important are future environmental guidelines that will affect 
  business decisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output by the chemical industry in Texas has surpassed the 1974 
  prerecession high, and new production records will likely be set for 
  some items this year. Supplies of such basic chemicals as ethylene, 
  propylene, butadiene, benzene, toluene, and xylene are readily 
  available. No production bottlenecks are anticipated by the industry 
  as output rises, but a couple of potential problems are being 
  monitored. Plants dependent upon natural gas liquids for feedstocks 
  may have to look harder for their inputs by year-end, and the rubber 
  workers' strike and a delayed recovery in the market for rubber 
  products are slowing the output of butadiene. A firming in chemical 
  prices has improved prospects for industry profits, and plans are 
  made to expand capacity in a number of areas. A chemical engineering 
  consulting firm notes, however, that plant expansions could be 
  hampered by shortages of castings.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventories of agricultural chemicals are high, and production has 
  been cut until stocks are reduced to more manageable levels. A major 
  producer states that ammonia, potash, and phosphate are now selling 
  near producers' costs. With inventories high, the Texas-based 
  company has closed down one of its phosphate plants in Florida. 
  Prices for agricultural chemicals are expected to remain weak, and 
  only if there is a significant increase in fertilizer exports would 
  prices move up.
     </p>
     <p>
      Apparel production in Texas has recovered to the prerecession level 
  of output. Most plants are operating at 100 percent of capacity, and 
  many firms have given as much as 20 to 25 percent of their current 
  business to apparel contractors. The busiest firms have experienced 
  two- to four-week delays in receiving the more popular piece goods. 
  But some signs of softening in the apparel market have been noted 
  recently. The fall market for women's clothing, held in Dallas in 
  May, was rated as only "fair" compared to earlier markets that were 
"hot." And although the sales of men's slacks continued strong, 
  demand for leisure jackets has weakened. Apparel manufacturers are 
  not planning significant increases in plant capacity this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper production appears to be the weakest industry in nondurable 
  goods manufacturing in Texas. A major producer, however, states 
  business is relatively good, as the rate of capacity utilization has 
  increased to 85 percent from a low of 70 percent. There are 
  shortages of Kraft paper and linerboard. Raw materials costs are 
  going up at a 10-percent annual rate, but some softening in prices 
  is expected this year. Plant expansions are likely in some segments 
  of the industry, but everyone seems to be hedging their positions 
  until future economic conditions can be more clearly ascertained.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production of color television sets should continue to increase 
  rapidly. In light of current demand projections, a major 
  manufacturer plans to increase production of subassemblies by one-third at its border plant in Cuidad Juarez, Mexico. Employment at 
  the plant stands at 3,800 workers, up from a recession low of 2,400. 
  The higher level of production would mean a 10-percent increase in 
  the number of workers on the first shift and a doubling of the 
  second shift. No production bottlenecks are anticipated, but some 
  deterioration in the quality of ceramic capacitors purchased from 
  far eastern suppliers has been noted. The failure rate of these 
  components is expected to decline, however, after foreign 
  manufacturers adjust to higher production levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production of primary metals is running a little above the recession 
  low. Most metal plants are running 75 to 80 percent of capacity, but 
  there is more strength in steel tubing used in drilling. The weak 
  construction market continues to hold down production of steel, 
  aluminum, and copper. Structural steel firms are concerned that no 
  new highway construction contracts are being let in Texas, and one 
  aluminum smelter has remained idle since last summer due to high 
  energy costs. Few additions to capacity are seen in this industry. A 
  couple of new energy-efficient steel and aluminum plants are coming 
  on-stream to replace older plants, and a large diameter steel pipe 
  mill is to be constructed by 1978. Other investment outlays planned 
  are to meet the EPA's 1978 standards, which in the case of one 
  copper plant will exceed the value of its present facilities. A 
  potential bottleneck is the future market for scrap steel. World 
  demand for scrap is soft, but should it firm before construction 
  activity recovers, scrap prices could rise to unprofitable levels 
  for some structural steel manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite a sharp four-month decline in the number of active drilling 
  rigs, the outlook for drilling remains optimistic. One major 
  equipment supplier feels that, with the exception of last year, 
  total activity in 1976 could be at the highest level since 1962. 
  Output of oil field equipment is holding up, although current 
  production of oil rigs is coming largely from the backlog of 
  unfilled orders. Because of the slack in new orders, production 
  could be affected by next year. Demand is strong, however, for such 
  items as handling equipment, high pressure valves, and "fishing" tools. The oil field equipment industry has no plans to increase 
  capacity and, like the mining sector, is waiting for Congress to 
  outline a national energy policy which would determine much of the 
  future course of production.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of the transportation equipment industry found a wide range 
  of capacity utilization rates among major segments of the industry. 
  The District's only auto assembly plantâ€”a producer of intermediate-size carsâ€”is running a 
  six-day week. That workweek was established 
  in February by an expanded overtime schedule that required hiring 
  few new employees. The only bottleneck being experienced is a 
  shortage of tires which requires new production units to be 
  delivered without spares. A helicopter manufacturer is experiencing 
  a slackening in nonmilitary sales and, as a result, has permitted 
  its work force to decline 4 percent through attrition. Aircraft 
  sales are expected to firm by year-end, but no additions to capacity 
  are planned.
