      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Business conditions in the Eighth District continue to improve 
  somewhat, although the rate of expansion has been at a slower pace 
  in recent weeks than in the first half of the year. Businessmen 
  generally remain optimistic as to economic activity through next 
  year. Their views on future price movements, however, were mixed 
  ranging from moderation to some acceleration in the inflation rate 
  next year. Retailers reported that sales volume has been unchanged, 
  on balance, in recent weeks from midyear levels. Most manufacturing 
  firms noted a slower growth rate of orders through the summer which 
  has continued in recent weeks. While housing construction has made 
  substantial gains this year, this industry has tended to level off 
  recently. Harvesting of crops is well underway in the District. 
  Yields are generally below average due to the damage inflicted by 
  drought, but in some areas are good.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businessmen were asked in this month's interviews about their 
  expectation of future price increases for the rest of this year and 
  for 1977. Responses indicated that for the rest of 1976 price 
  increases will be more moderate than that of recent months. Most 
  firms noted that their own prices had been increased earlier in the 
  year. No clear consensus emerged from the responses concerning 
  inflation next year. Those who were pessimistic pointed to the 
  recent wage settlements which they considered too high to be offset 
  by productivity gains and to the tendency for excessive government 
  spending. Those viewing inflation as likely to slow next year 
  pointed to continued excess capacity, the slower rate of economic 
  gains in recent months and the moderate rate of monetary growth. 
  Businessmen generally report a more cautious expansion than in the 
  1972-73 recovery which is viewed as an important factor in achieving 
  an orderly transition to stable prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales have registered little or no gain in recent months. 
  Retailers noted that sales during the back-to-school period were 
  good, but sales subsequently fell back to the previous level. 
  Despite this lull in sales, retailers generally expect sales gains 
  later this year. Automobile sales apparently suffered recently in 
  some areas from a lack of car inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturing activity apparently leveled off during the past month. 
  A chemical industry representative reported that business was steady 
  in the third quarter after substantial gains in the first two 
  quarters of the year. A major appliance manufacturer reported that 
  sales of appliances are approximately 3 percent ahead of a year ago, 
  but that sales gains in recent weeks have been slower than expected. 
  Nevertheless, a 10 percent increase in sales and production is 
  expected in 1977. Paper and steel manufacturers reported slower 
  increases in business in recent months than earlier in the year. A 
  paint and coating firm noted some pickup in demand in August and 
  September, but not as much as had been expected earlier. On the 
  other hand, a manufacturer of diesel engines reported operations at 
  full capacity and order backlogs well into next year. This firm is 
  now planning further capital expansion.
     </p>
     <p>
      Housing activity in single-family construction, after making sizable 
  gains throughout the District in 1975 and 1976, has apparently 
  leveled off. Apartment construction is picking up slightly in 
  various parts of the District, but remains relatively low compared 
  with 1972 and 1973. Commercial and industrial construction continues 
  rather sluggish. One contractor noted that major retail chains are 
  planning expansion for 1978 through 1980 but are contemplating 
  little expansion next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for commercial and industrial loans has remained unchanged in 
  the past two months and interest rates have declined somewhat 
  according to local bankers. One reason given for the low loan demand 
  by business is that corporate treasurers are underpaying corporate 
  taxes and thus have more funds for financing inventories. One banker 
  expects loan demand to rise in the near future, and the increase to 
  be observed first in small communities. Savings and loan 
  associations report sizable gains in deposits during recent months. 
  Liquid investments are substantially above last year and borrowings 
  from the Federal Home Loan Banks are down considerably. Interest 
  rates on home mortgages in the St. Louis area, however, remain 
  unchanged in the past month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop harvesting appears to be ahead of schedule in most of the 
  District reflecting favorable harvesting weather. Yields are 
  generally below average in the western portion of the District, 
  while generally good in the eastern portion. Cotton yields are 
  likewise mixed depending on the location. Rice yields are good to 
  excellent in Arkansas but prices are relatively low. Reports 
  indicate that land prices are continuing to rise rapidly in parts of 
  the District. Recent farm land sales in parts of Illinois have been 
  reported at prices up to $3,500 per acre and cash rents at $125 per 
  acre.
