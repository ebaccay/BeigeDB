      Beige Book Report: San Francisco
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      This report is based upon a survey of Head Office and Branch 
Directors, supplemented by reports from selected businesses. The 
general opinion is that the economy is experiencing a mild slowdown, 
and there is no expectation of a complete recovery until the end of 
the year. At the same time, there is little optimism that inflation 
will be brought under control quickly. Consumer demand continues to 
be high, although sales are somewhat slower than last year, and 
there is continued demand upon banks for credit. The adverse effects 
of the slowdown appear in two principal forms. Unemployment is seen 
to be much higher this year, and many firms report experiencing a 
profit squeeze. They say that they are unable to offset by price 
increases or greater sales volume their higher costs. In 
consequence, they are attempting to cut expenses by reducing staffs, 
cutting inventories, and delaying capital protects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unemployment has risen in most parts of the District. The highest 
levels are in the Pacific Northwest where the principal problems are 
centered in the lumber industry and Boeing Aircraft. Boeing is the 
principal employer in the Seattle-Tacoma area, and it has cut its 
employment from over 100,000 in 1968 to 58,000 now, with further 
layoffs announced for the rest of this year to reduce the level to 
43,000. Lumber operations have been at a reduced pace throughout 
much of Washington and Oregon. Apparently the smaller mills are 
bearing the major burden, while the large integrated mills continue 
to maintain production. There is some expectation of a recovery, at 
least in Oregon, toward the end of the year. The other area with a 
major unemployment problem is southern California, where the 
affected industries are aerospace and, to a less extent, housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Construction of new residential housing and the opening of new 
subdivisions continue to be slow. The decline in demand is heaviest 
in the Seattle area because of the layoffs at Boeing. The principal 
strength is in commercial construction. This is certainly the case 
in California where commercial building remains high. In many cases 
there is also a strong demand for mobile homes. This particular 
change may be part of a tendency for consumers to downgrade the 
quality of their housing demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales remain relatively steady despite the rising 
unemployment, and they continue to be a source of strength in most 
areas. For most kinds of consumer goods, there is no sign of 
downgrading in choice of items as a means of economizing. Consumers 
are reported to be more careful in watching for and responding to 
sales, but there is no pronounced shift to lower grade goods. When 
purchases of major appliances are made, the demand is still for the 

  higher-grade line. Replies from major department stores indicate the 
general composition of their business is not changed, although sales 
are not rising at last year's pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is one major exception to this picture. Reports from 
throughout the District indicate that consumers are economizing on 
their automobile purchases. They are shifting away from middle-line 
models to lower priced and foreign economy cars, although luxury car 
demand remains high. As part of this shift, there appears to be an 
increased demand for late model used cars. Therefore, there is 
evidence of both a reduction of automobile purchases and a 
downgrading of quality of purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent decline in the stock market has not had any noticeable 
impact on consumer purchases, but it does seem to contribute toward 
creating more general uncertainty on the part of businessmen. One 
specific example of the effect of lower stock prices reported is 
those cases where stock had been used as loan collateral and the 
borrowers were forced to sell at a loss to cover the loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many businesses report that their profit margins are being narrowed 
by higher costs, especially labor costs and by an inability to raise 
their revenue. Sales are not rising to offset the costs, and general 
price increases are not always feasible. In consequence, there is 
more emphasis upon cost reductions. This takes various forms: closer 
controls over inventories, increased layoffs of employees, and in 
some cases postponement of capital projects. In fact, one of the 
clearest responses of individual businesses to this combination of 
smaller profit margins and continued high interest rates appears in 
the reduction of capital spending. One large oil company, for 
example, describes its projects as being continuously reviewed, and 
several other manufacturing companies report a postponement and 
reduction of planned expenditures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial pressures are also an element in the slowing of business 
capital expenditures. Several companies reported credit stringency 
and high interest costs as factors leading to a revision in their 
plans. In one case, foreign financial conditions caused difficulties 
for one company; foreign banks were unable to supply funds normally 
utilized by this business. Financial conditions continue to be cited 
as an important adverse factor influencing the construction 
industry. This is in spite of deliberate efforts by banks to 
allocate funds to meet this demand. Banks are continuing to be 
selected in the kinds of loans that they make.
     </p>
     <p>
      In summary, reports of our directors and other businessmen point to 
a slowing of the pace of economic activity and a greater reluctance 
on their part to undertake major expenditures in the near future.
