      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in the Fourth District continues to be spotty, with 
  virtually no improvement in employment from last spring's low. 
  Capital goods and steel remain weak, although signs of pickup are 
  noted. Retailers are cautious in their predictions for Christmas 
  sales. Deposit flows into savings and loans were again at high 
  levels, according to some associations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nondurable goods producers continue to report strong recovery, and 
  conditions in capital goods industries are mixed. Recovery in 
  petrochemicals has been rapid, according to one producer, and sales 
  have almost returned to pre-recessionary levels. A producer of 
  plastics also reports a fast recovery, as sales in October and 
  November rose more than expected. Production for this quarter is 
  expected to be 15 percent greater than last quarter. An economist 
  with a tire producer reports passenger tire sales continue to 
  recover. Retail inventories are 15 percent below a year earlier, but 
  manufacturers' inventories are still a little high.
     </p>
     <p>
      Machine tool orders continue their gradual climb. One firm expects a 
  50-percent increase in orders during 1976, compared with a 60-percent drop experienced this year. Two mining machinery producers 
  report a good order book; one has backlogs stretching into 1978. 
  Orders for farm implements are also holding at high levels. A 
  national producer of electrodes and welding equipment reports it is 
  still allocating orders because of high demand from pipelines, 
  mining, and shipbuilding. Its welding business this quarter is 
  expected to be at least 5 percent higher than last quarter. Recovery 
  from the slump in heavy duty trucks has been slow. A producer 
  reports that truck sales for the first 10 months of this year were 
  off 40 percent from the same period last year and that orders have 
  been picking up slowly since last spring. He expects that 
  uncertainty over government regulations on braking devices will 
  hamper recovery. Demand for other types of capital goods, especially 
  from construction and electric utilities, remains weak. One producer 
  reports that orders for generators fell 50 percent during the 
  recession and that little pickup is in sight. Construction machinery 
  continues to weaken, and prospects are for continued weakness into 
  1976. A producer of lighting fixtures for streets and highways 
  reports that public construction is also weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel orders have been picking up a little, although heavy inventory 
  liquidation is holding down recovery in orders and production. 
  Orders for January delivery are somewhat better than for December, 
  and steel economists expect shipments for the first quarter of 1976 
  will rise 10 to 15 percent over the fourth quarter of 1975. Steel 
  inventory liquidation next quarter is expected to be about half as 
  large as in the present quarter. One economist reports that the 
  October 1 steel price increases are holding despite some discounting 
  from published prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Bank's monthly survey of manufacturing for November suggests 
  that the rate of increase in manufacturing activity in the District 
  has flattened in the last two months. A preliminary report indicates 
  an equal number of manufacturers had increases and decreases in new 
  orders and shipments during November. For the first time in a year, 
  more manufacturers built inventories than depleted inventories. 
  Manufacturers also report no improvement in employment, and price 
  increases were as pervasive in November as they were in August and 
  September. For December, manufacturers expect another month of 
  inventory buildup, virtually no gain in employment, and no abatement 
  in upward price pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers are cautious in their appraisal of holiday sales. A 
  financial officer for a large department store reports that sales in 
  November were somewhat stronger than a year earlier, except for 
  household goods, and that their inventories have been built in the 
  hope of a better selling season this year than last year. An 
  economist with a large national department store chain reports 
  moderate improvements in unit sales of soft goods in recent months 
  while sales of household goods remain weak. Both expect markdowns to 
  be no greater than usual for this time of year, and both express 
  concern that retail sales will not recover if income tax cuts are 
  not extended into 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment in the District has hardly improved from the low of last 
  April. Scattered layoffs in the steel and machinery industries have 
  offset a gradual pickup in some other industries, especially rubber, 
  fabricated metals, and glass. A supplier to the automotive industry 
  reports his firm laid off 5,000 workers during the recession and has 
  no immediate plans to rehire them. A tire producer reports some 
  recalls have occurred in response to strengthening production but 
  that additional layoffs may be necessary in those lines that still 
  have excessive inventories. Supplemental unemployment benefits funds 
  are depleted for some tire company workers. One retailer reports it 
  will hire more part-time help for the holiday season than it did a 
  year ago but still less than normal, and another reports hirings 
  will be about normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Net deposit inflows at savings and loans were strong in November. 
  One association reports a record for the month, and another reports 
  inflows were strong but below their record in October. Mortgage 
  terms eased in recent weeks. The bulk of loans are for existing 
  dwellings. Liquidity is generally well above requirements, although 
  one association will borrow funds in order to finance its aggressive 
  mortgage lending position.
