      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 14, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and its 
Branches report that economic activity remains generally strong in 
their areas, with the exception of residential construction. Concern 
was expressed about the energy supply situation, and most 
respondents called for an end to wage-price controls. Farm prospects 
continue strong, except among some cattle feeders. Total loan demand 
at District banks was weak in October, with business loans the 
weakest component.
      </p>
      <p>
       General economic activity remains strong in most parts of the Tenth 
District, although some slowing in the rate of increase has 
occurred. Retail sales as a whole continue to be fairly strong, but 
automobile sales seem to be weaker than anticipated earlier. 
Residential construction is reported to be generally slower across 
the District. Home-building is off in Omaha and Oklahoma City as 
well as in out-state Nebraska and Oklahoma. Earlier overbuilding of 
apartments in Oklahoma City has led to extremely high vacancy rates 
as well as to a halt in new construction. Only Denver reports 
continued strength in home-building, with construction labor in 
tight supply. Commercial construction activity is holding up better 
than home-building in most areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two matters of concern were mentioned specifically by several 
Directors: the energy situation, and wage-price controls. Reactions 
to the energy situation were mixed. (These reports preceded the 
President's speech on the subject.) Several Directors blamed the 
situation on "going overboard on ecology." "Much concern over the 
energy crisis" is reported from Albuquerque, while little concern 
was reported from smaller cities and agricultural areas of Colorado 
and Oklahoma. While one respondent felt that the situation was not 
as critical in Denver as elsewhere, another reported that "people 
here in Denver are scared...of what the energy crisis will bring." 
One Director believes that current economic forecasts are giving too 
little weight to the energy supply situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only one Director spoke in favor of keeping wage-price controls in 
place. All others commenting on them believed that controls should 
be abandoned soon, as being "ineffective" and "an unnecessary 
nuisance." A Director in the steel business remarked that controls 
have really "goofed up" that industry, specifically by keeping 
prices of some items so low that they become unprofitable to produce 
and hence difficult to get.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, farm prospects continue strong in most areas, although 
the downturn in cattle prices has put several producers in serious 
trouble. This stems from their buying feeder animals at 
unrealistically high levels and then holding them too long, thinking 
that prices were bound to go up shortly after the freeze was lifted. 
However, it was the Directors' view that, while a few smaller 
operators would suffer big losses, most producers are in good enough 
financial shape to weather the storm, assuming that cattle prices 
strengthen in the not too distant future. Most of the other sectors 
seem to be in excellent shape. The harvest is progressing rapidly, 
the crops are good, and prices are such that crop income will show a 
sharp jump over last year. Furthermore, producers of feeder and 
stocker cattle are still making good profits, although not as good 
as was experienced earlier in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Locally severe flooding occurred this fall in parts of Kansas, 
Nebraska, and Oklahoma. The effects in Nebraska have not been as 
harmful as first expected, and high prices and good crops there are 
contributing to a healthy economic situation for the state as a 
whole. In Oklahoma, the floods affected some of the best wheat land 
in the state. The major impact there is likely to be the lessened 
availability of winter pasture on much of that land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District bankers indicate that total loan demand was weak in 
October, although this was not uniformly true for all banks 
contacted. In general, the component of loan demand reported weakest 
was business loans, while agricultural and real estate loans were 
generally steady. On the other hand, consumer installment loan 
demand was reported as being strong. Most respondents reporting weak 
loan demand also reported that the interest rates they were charging 
were declining or would decline in the near future. The decline in 
interest rates was attributed to the need to keep rates in line with 
money market conditions in New York. One respondent reported that it 
lowered its rates to compete on a national level with large money 
center banks as its national business was off somewhat. No 
respondent reported any effects on rates charged from the newly 
imposed ceiling on wild-card CDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total deposits at weekly reporting banks continued to increase in 
October. In conformity with the trend for this year, but in contrast 
to September, most of the increase in deposits was in time and 
savings deposits rather than in demand deposits. Large CDs at weekly 
reporting banks also increased substantially in October. Several of 
the banks surveyed, however, especially those reporting weak loan 
demand, reported a runoff in CDs and a reduction in their CD rates. 
This gives rise to the possibility that the runoff may have been 
intentional on their part.
