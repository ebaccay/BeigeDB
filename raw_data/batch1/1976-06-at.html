      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The southeastern economy continues to expand, although the advance 
  remains uneven: Capacity utilization rates are high in most major 
  industries. Yet manufacturers report no unusual shortages or 
  bottlenecks of raw materials, with the exception of natural gas. 
  Consumer spending remains strong in some areas but has weakened in 
  others. Florida's phosphate industry began layoffs; the continuing 
  rubber strike also reduced employment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in the Southeast has become ambivalent. Autos and 
  trucks are selling well throughout the District, and mobile home 
  sales are strong in some places. Sales of soft goods, however, have 
  leveled off in several areas. This development may reflect a 
  weakening of business activity or simply a growing emphasis by 
  consumers on durable goods purchases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Florida's phosphate industry has begun layoffs because export demand 
  and domestic fertilizer sales are low. High prices and the Midwest 
  drought have reduced fertilizer applications. Phosphate inventories 
  are at a five-year high. Two companies have laid off 350 workers, 
  while a third has idled 1,000 of 1,300 workers. The ongoing rubber 
  strike has reduced employment in Alabama.
     </p>
     <p>
      The shortage which primarily concerns southeastern industries is 
  natural gas. There is little worry about the supply of electric 
  power, although in some areas the cost of electricity is uncertain 
  because natural gas curtailment necessitates substitution of more 
  costly fuels. In one area of the District, gas cutoff to customers 
  with interruptible service is expected for 320 days in 1976 compared 
  to 50 days in 1974; there is concern that this makes the locality 
  unattractive to manufacturers seeking plant locations. Many 
  companies report programs for energy conservation and installation 
  of stand-by energy systems, so their major worry is the impact of a 
  gas shortage on costs rather than continuity of production. However, 
  these programs absorb capital which might otherwise be used to 
  enlarge production capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Three automobile assembly plants in the Atlanta area, which 
  manufacture intermediate- and full-size cars as well as light 
  trucks, report production at record levels. Yet, with the obvious 
  exception of tires, no supply problems are reported. A small 
  tiremaker expects the current strike-induced shortage to persist 
  because of the difficulty of replenishing rapidly depleting 
  inventories while meeting new vehicle production requirements, as 
  well as seasonally high replacement demand. Mobile home 
  manufacturers are still operating with significant excess capacity, 
  and no raw material shortages are occurring.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major steel producer estimates industry operations at 80 to 90 
  percent of capacity but reports no shortages. Lead times are 
  increasing on flat-rolled steel used in consumer products, and some 
  talk is heard of allocations in late 1976. Steel grades used for 
  capital goods manufacturing and heavy construction are in abundant 
  supply. A large distributor of metal products notes an excess of 
  goods and states that shortages of flat-rolled steel caused by 
  increased automobile output have been relieved by production 
  adjustments. This source foresees no serious stringencies until the 
  capital goods and heavy construction industries resume higher 
  operating levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among companies using metal products, a manufacturer of school buses 
  and a distributor which stocks over 90,000 automobile replacement 
  parts find no unusual supply problems. Other steel users have 
  current shortages of some steel products or are expecting them. Some 
  firms are building inventories in anticipation of shortages and 
  higher prices. In nonferrous metals, shortages are reported for 
  aluminum sheets and aluminum plates used for printing. Large 
  chemical companies are utilizing 90 to 100 percent of capacity; this 
  level is expected to continue. No shortages other than natural gas 
  are reported or expected. Most firms are constructing sizable 
  additions to capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Textile mills are now operating at 85 to 100 percent of capacity, 
  based on three daily work shifts. New capacity for denim production 
  is currently under construction. Prospects for cotton prices have 
  caused some worry in view of crop forecasts and strong foreign 
  demand, but no raw material bottlenecks are reported or foreseen. In 
  apparel, present levels of production vary but are expected to reach 
  full capacity use by year-end. Output is being increased by hiring 
  rather than by plant expansion. The only evidence of shortages is 
  longer lead times for synthetic and spun yarn fabrics. Some reports 
  suggest that retailers' and manufacturers' reluctance to build 
  inventories may result in an influx of last-minute orders for fall 
  goods which will be impossible to fill.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the carpet industry, unused capacity is abundant and should not 
  be exhausted in 1976. Plant investment is primarily in the form of 
  product line changes and additions to distribution facilities, 
  although one latex manufacturing plant is being built. 
  Transportation is adequate, but truck carrier costs are a major 
  source of price increases. Overcapacity among fiber producers has 
  recently led to some price reductions.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paper producers' capacity use has risen sharply during the past year 
  and is approaching full utilization; it is expected to remain high. 
  Price increases and some shortages have recently occurred for 
  newsprint; cardboard containers have also been reported in short 
  supply. Some producers regard restriction of timber cutting in 
  national forests as a potential threat to raw material supplies. No 
  reports of pulpwood or chemicals shortages have been received.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wood products companies present a contrasting picture. A 
  manufacturer of pine and paper chemicals, with capacity usage at 75 
  percent, finds no raw material problems. But a lumber exporter is 
  experiencing bottlenecks in raw materials and finished goods, which 
  he expects to continue for the remainder of the year despite 
  operating levels well below capacity.
