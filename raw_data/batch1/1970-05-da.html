      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 20, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Continued inflation is the major concern of Eleventh District board 
members surveyed at a mid-May meeting in Dallas. A recession is 
considered possible by a number of the board members, but this 
prospect is causing less concern than inflation since there is a 
widespread belief among the directors that a recession would be 
short and mild. A liquidity crisis is mentioned as a possibility by 
only one-third of the respondents, and the odds attached to this 
outcome are relatively low. With this overall economic outlook, the 
board members expected sales to show no increase or only a small 
increase in 1970, while profits are expected to decline. One 
director thought there might be a fall of more than 5 percent in 
both sales and profits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Every board member reported that employee wages in their firms were 
being increased in 1970. This direct experience with higher wage 
costs may be one reason for the almost unanimous concern with 
inflation, ahead of other economic problems. The smallest wage 
increase (4 percent) was cited by an academic leader, while the 
largest (10 percent) was mentioned by a banker. The nonbanking 
businessmen mentioned 6 percent most often as the wage adjustment 
they were making this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The respondents were unanimous in their view that the Federal budget 
would operate with a deficit this year. Apparently, the 
Administration's forecast of a budget surplus is not accepted within 
the business and financial community, although a few directors 
thought the deficit might be small.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite some concern about a mild recession, acknowledgment of 
higher labor costs, and a generally poor outlook for profits this 
year, there were no reports of employment cutbacks by the bankers 
and businessmen interviewed and no indication that employment cuts 
were currently being considered. In fact, plans for very modest 
expansion of the labor force were noted by a couple of respondents. 
This reported maintenance of employment levels is consistent with 
the aggregate data for the Eleventh District, which show total 
employment still edging upward. The increase in employment, however, 
has not been sufficient to absorb all of the new labor force 
entrants in the District states. Thus, there has been an increase in 
unemployment in the Eleventh District since the end of 1969, and 
unemployment insurance activity is at a considerably higher level.
     </p>
     <p>
      The respondents to our survey did note some softening in planned 
plant and equipment spending. More than half indicated that their 
January expectations had been revised downward; the estimates of the 
magnitude of the downward revision were vague but apparently 
indicated, in most cases, trimming around the edges rather than 
wholesale slashing. An executive of one major manufacturing concern 
did indicate that planned plant and equipment spending was 
undergoing a "substantial" cutback.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Texas industrial production index edged up in March, but has 
generally flattened since the beginning of 1970. Increased demand 
for petroleum and petro-chemical products has helped to strengthen 
the economy in both Texas and other District states. Oil production 
in the Eleventh District has remained near record levels throughout 
the spring, usually a period of seasonal slack.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the same time, drilling activity has been rebounding from a 27-year low. Construction contract activity in the District showed 
renewed strength in the first quarter of 1970, compared with either 
the year-earlier period or the fourth quarter of 1969. Nonbuilding 
construction contracts were up considerably, buoyed by two very 
large contracts; nonresidential contracts also showed a sizable 
increase. A seasonal expansion in construction employment has 
occurred this spring, although the gain came earlier and was 
somewhat less than usual.
     </p>
     <p>
      Department store sales in the Eleventh District through early May 
were up moderately in dollar value, but less than the amount 
required to offset inflation. Sales in early May appeared somewhat 
stronger than has been the case for the year as a whole so far.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural activities throughout most of the Eleventh District are 
progressing under generally favorable weather conditions. Cash 
receipts from farm marketings in the District states were up 
substantially in the first two months of 1970, compared with year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand in the Eleventh District remained sluggish in April, as 
total loans at weekly reporting commercial banks declined 
contraseasonally. With both time and savings deposits increasing, 
District banks added considerably to their holdings of securities, 
particularly municipals. Time deposits have increased recently due 
mainly to the sale of large CDs. Some tightening in District bank 
reserve positions in April is reflected in the increase in weekly 
average net Federal funds purchased and in discount window 
borrowings, compared with the March levels.
