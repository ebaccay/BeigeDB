       Recent economic indicators reflect growing strength in district 
economy. The Texas industrial production index rose in April for the 
fourth consecutive month. Construction contracts in the district 
reached a record level, and the unemployment rate declined slightly. 
A survey of head office and branch directors revealed a clear 
majority expect economic activity in their community and industries 
to increase moderately over the rest of 1972. However, directors 
believe the improving economic conditions will be accompanied by 
rates of price increase about equal to or somewhat faster than 
recent rates. Despite the expectation of improved economic 
conditions, directors from district industries anticipate levels of 
employment, plant and equipment expenditures and inventory 
investment at their firms to remain about unchanged during the 
remainder of 1972. Banking directors now expect a moderate increase 
in market interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost three-fourths of the directors feel economic activity in 
their area was somewhat stronger in May than during the first 
quarter, and two-thirds of the directors foresee a moderate further 
gain in activity during the next six months. Directors from 
commercial banks were more optimistic about economic conditions 
during the rest of 1972 than were directors from business firms in 
the district. The outlook for prices by both businessmen and bankers 
was not optimistic. Eighty percent of the directors expect prices to 
be rising at the end of 1972 at about the same rate or somewhat 
faster than in recent months. Only 20 percent of the directors felt 
prices would be rising at a somewhat slower rate by the end of 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors associated with nonbanking business were surveyed with 
respect to the outlook for their firms and industries. A majority 
anticipated employment, plant and equipment expenditures and 
inventories for their firms will remain about the same between now 
and the end of the year. None of the respondents was anticipating 
higher employment by the end of the year, and one was anticipating 
substantially lower employment. Only two directors rated summer 
employment opportunities for students at their firms as good or very 
good, and this was offset by two who rated summer employment 
opportunities as bad or very bad. The majority indicated summer 
employment opportunities at their firms were marginal. While the 
majority of business directors anticipated inventories at the end of 
the year would be about the same as the present level, two directors 
anticipated moderately higher inventories. Most of the directors 
felt actions of the Price Commission would have a moderate or 
marginal effect on slowing price increases in their industries. 
However, only three directors felt the Pay Board would have any 
effect in slowing increases in wage rates in their industries during 
the remainder of the year. Two-thirds of the business directors did 
not expect their company profits to be affected in 1972 by Phase II 
controls, while the other one-third expected a slight negative 
effect on profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       Commercial banking directors were asked about recent loan demand at 
their banks and their expectations about interest rates. The 
majority felt the demand for business loans, consumer loans and 
mortgage loans was much higher at their banks in May than in the 
first quarter of 1972. While demand for agricultural loans was 
essentially unchanged, loan demand was particularly strong in the 
construction industries. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of bank 
directors stated their banks' willingness to make loans had remained 
essentially unchanged from the first quarter. Funds at their banks 
were judged to be moderately available or very available to meet 
loan demand at the present time. Not a single banking director 
expects a moderate increase in short-term rates during the next six 
months: half feel long-term rates will also rise moderately, but 
the other half feel long-term rates will remain at about present 
levels. The banking directors believe the prime lending rate will be 
between 5 1/2 and 6 percent by the end of the year, with 5 3/4 
percent the most frequently mentioned rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seasonally adjusted Texas industrial production index rose in 
April for the fourth consecutive month. In manufacturing, all 
industry groups reported monthly as well as year-to-year gains. 
Petroleum refining, a significant industry in the index, increased 
14.1 percent over last April. Oil allowables in the district's four 
producing states were left unchanged for June. Seasonally adjusted 
total employment in the five southwestern states receded slightly in 
April, but nonfarm payroll employment remained at the March level 
and the unemployment rate edged downward. All industry groups showed 
year-to-year gains in payroll employment. Construction activity in 
the five southwestern states continued its fast pace. The total 
value of contracts awarded rose to a record level in April. Sales of 
department stores in the district continued to show monthly and 
year-to-year gains, but automobile registrations dropped 
significantly in April from March levels.
