      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The dominant economic event in the Ninth District continues to be 
  the drought and its impact on the region's business activity. 
  Reduced crop yields and a depressed livestock industry are 
  manifestations of this situation, and concern now centers on their 
  impact on income in late 1976 and into 1977. In contrast to 
  agricultural developments, however, some strengthening is evident in 
  other sectors of the region's economy. District retailers report 
  some pickup in sales while auto sales and the tourist business 
  continue to be good. District home building has been quite strong 
  this year. With regard to price expectations, District firms do not 
  foresee any excessive inflationary pressures developing and many 
  indicate demand is not yet strong enough to justify large price 
  increases.
     </p>
     <p>
      The drought has affected the District economy in several ways. The 
  most obvious is reduced yields on many crops, especially corn and 
  soybeans. Though the District wheat crop was quite good, dry weather 
  has impaired river navigation and some difficulty is being 
  experienced in shipping wheat from this region. In addition, the 
  drought has increased livestock marketings and this has helped push 
  livestock prices well below year-earlier levels. Also, the drought 
  conditions are currently retarding seeding of winter wheat, and if 
  top soil moisture is not replenished this winter and next spring, 
  reduced yields are likely again next year. Drought-induced shortages 
  in cash farm receipts throughout the remainder of the year and into 
  1977 will hold down District personal income growth and restrict 
  District business activity. In response to this situation, loans at 
  District ag banks, Federal land banks, and production credit 
  associations have already increased. However, bank liquidity is not 
  yet a problem, though some lenders were voicing concern about loan 
  repayments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales were disappointing last quarter, with summer and back-to-school business below expectations. Nevertheless, business in 
  this region was reported to be better than in many other parts of 
  the country. More recently though, District retailers surveyed by 
  this Bank stated that business has begun to improve, and they are 
  quite optimistic about the outlook for fall and the holiday season. 
  Although some unwanted inventory accumulation occurred this summer 
  as sales slackened, retailers are generally satisfied with current 
  inventory levels and are cautious about building inventories for the 
  Christmas season.
     </p>
     <p>
      District auto sales have been rising about in line with national 
  sales increases. Full- and intermediate-sized autos are in 
  particularly short supply in this area, although demand for these 
  sizes has moderated slightly over the last quarter. Ford and 
  Lincoln/Mercury dealers so far have had no problems satisfying 
  consumer demands, despite the strike.
     </p>
     <p>
      It was a good summer for the tourist business. Large resort owners 
  throughout the District had a very profitable summer, with most 
  reporting an increase in vacation traffic. However, the closing of 
  this fall's hunting and fishing seasons in northern Minnesota, due 
  to dryness and fire danger, is expected to significantly decrease 
  that area's tourist and recreational spending.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home building in the District has been particularly strong. Although 
  residential building permits for the year are only 7 percent above 
  1975 compared to the 30 percent national growth, the District's 
  decline in 1973-75 was not nearly as severe as the nation's. As a 
  result, District housing unit authorizations are back to the 1972 
  rates, whereas the nation is still running 30 percent behind its 
  1972 pace. Availability of mortgage funds for private housing is 
  good, loan commitments are at a high level, and liquidity at 
  financial institutions is above year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Home building may be showing strength, but other construction 
  activity is weak. In dollar terms, both nonresidential and 
  nonbuilding contract awards are off significantly from last year in 
  the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although prices are expected to continue climbing, District firms 
  responding to a special survey do not foresee excessive price 
  increases either for the goods they purchase or the products they 
  sell. An economist for one major retailer headquartered in the Twin 
  Cities indicated that his firm's prices on merchandise purchases 
  have been quite stable and expects his firm to increase their prices 
  about 5-1/2 to 6 percent next year. Another Twin City-based 
  retailer's economist believes retail prices won't increase 
  significantly until demand becomes firmer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two construction firms report moderate increases for most material 
  costs, except for lumber and plywood, and don't look for that trend 
  in price increases to change.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most manufacturing prices are stable. Weak demand was holding price 
  increases down for an apparel manufacturer and a major paper 
  products manufacturer in our District. Also, three manufacturers of 
  communication and computer equipment do not foresee excessive price 
  increases. However, a publishing firm did indicate a steady increase 
  in paper costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      An area food producer said milk prices have dropped and expected 
  them to stay low. Only seasonal increases are foreseen for poultry 
  and eggs; however, some increase is foreseen in beef and pork prices 
  by the end of the year.
