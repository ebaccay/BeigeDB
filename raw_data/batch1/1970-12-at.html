      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economy of the Southeast is marking time. Although layoffs 
continue to dominate the employment news, there are enough bright 
spots in the District's economy to keep it on an even keel. 
Construction of low-income housing and road building is active, and 
a slow but steady flow of announcements of new plants or plant 
expansions is encouraging. A soon-to-be-released survey indicates 
Tennessee businessmen have a cautiously optimistic outlook. On the 
other hand, numerous announcements of further price increases have 
appeared. There is some sentiment among our directors for wage and 
price controls.
     </p>
     <p>
      The aluminum industry is fearful that it may have to settle for a 
package similar to the GM contract in its upcoming labor 
negotiations in spite of the fact that the industry is in the 
doldrums. Aluminum exports are off. One large producer has gradually 
reduced its labor force from 6,800 to 5,500, 1,000 being released in 
the last year. A producer in the New Orleans vicinity has recently 
shut down one of its lines, idling 125 aluminum workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Layoffs are also occurring in such industries as chemical, paper, 
airlines, and aircraft. A chemical firm in south Louisiana is idling 
800 employees, including administrators and supervisors. A north 
Florida paper producer is temporarily cutting its production—affecting 680 workers—and a southern Mississippi paper mill has 
gradually been reducing its work force. An aircraft R &amp; D Center 
will be dropping 300 employees by the end of the year. In Florida, 
200 employees of an airline were laid off because of a slowdown in 
business and tourist traffic. The weakness in the job market for 
college-educated people is underscored by a decrease in campus 
recruiting, especially by aerospace and defense-related firms and 
Federal agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Newspapers in the District have been carrying reports of price 
increases, and one paper decried the October increase in consumer 
prices in an editorial entitled "Up, Up and Away". Papers have 
recently highlighted price and wage increases in the following 
areas: white collar wages, freight rates, proposed Atlanta bus 
fares, intrastate bus fares in Georgia, Atlanta food prices, and 
proposed phone, utility, and milk prices. However, some articles 
have called attention to lower interest rates. For example, one 
article stated that Tennessee taxpayers saved about $4 million in 
interest costs because of lower interest rates on bonds. Also, it 
has been reported that differences in bids by construction 
subcontractors have been very small, indicating keen competition.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sluggish pace of economic activity has slowed the growth of 
revenues to state and local governments. As a consequence, these 
governments have begun to cut spending. For example, Georgia's 
budget for the current fiscal year was based on an anticipated 
revenue increase of 9.5 percent. But November receipts ran only 1.3 
percent above the year-ago level. This prompted cost-cutting 
measures in all areas of the state's government.
     </p>
     <p>
      The fire on the Shell Oil platform in the Gulf is more serious than 
the similar Chevron fire, because there are more wells on the 
platform and the prevailing currents at the site are toward the 
Coast. The Chevron fire resulted in a moratorium on well digging 
which depressed economic activity along the Louisiana and 
Mississippi Gulf Coasts. It is likely that those industries and 
localities which depend upon offshore oil drilling will again be 
adversely affected.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the bright side, production of light fixtures at a large plant in 
Mississippi is stabilizing after a gradual decline. In Florida 
outlays for road construction are increasing and two bond issues 
have recently received cabinet-level approval. Alabama's 
expenditures on roads will be about 25 per cent greater this year 
than last. A tire plant in Alabama has returned to production after 
being closed for more than a month. Those apparel plants 
specializing in new styles are doing very well.
     </p>
     <p>
      Furthermore, new plants are opening or have been announced for 
producing modular homes, metal products, chemical cellulose, travel 
trailers, and plastics. A director from south Alabama reports that 
the outlook for new plants and plant expansion in his locality is 
better than at any time during recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reasons given by Tennessee businessmen for their cautiously 
optimistic outlook include: "a lowering of interest rates", 
"improving credit collections", "an increasing investment capital 
supply in the state", and "expected reversal of the decline in the 
national economy". Many panelists, however, believe that several 
months will pass before these factors take effect and, thus strong 
expansion will not occur before midyear at the earliest. Rising 
costs, compared with resale prices, are identified by the panel as 
by far the most critical issue facing Tennessee businesses at 
present.
     </p>
     <p>
      Low-income residential construction has been active. For example, in 
Birmingham and Chattanooga, construction has recently commenced on 
two large residential projects for
      <br/>
      low-income families. In a rural 
area of Alabama, 99 percent of the homes financed by the Farmers 
Home Administration this year have been in the low-price range. Last 
year, only 50 percent of the homes similarly financed were in the 
low-price range. Although the 235 program is evidently responsible 
for many housing starts, three builders are reported to be leaving 
this type of construction because inspection regulations have added 
to costs. There has been a softening in the market for luxury 
condominiums in south Florida, with most buyers looking for units 
below $35,000.
