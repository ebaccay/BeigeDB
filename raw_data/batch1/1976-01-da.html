      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 14, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The year-long recovery in department store sales in the Eleventh 
District was capped by a big surge in Christmas buying. Most 
merchants found December sales far exceeded their earlier 
expectations and, as a result, unit sales were up significantly. 
Sales statistics were especially robust in Dallas and Houston, where 
many outlets reported sales revenues were up a fifth or more from a 
year earlier. In general, stores selling better quality merchandise 
recorded the biggest sales increases. Retailers also noted cash 
sales were abnormally high. For example, many stores reported half 
their sales were in cash, or more than twice the normal share. The 
current wave of buying is expected to continue into spring, with 
merchants expressing sales prospects as good to very good. Current 
inventory levels are generally considered to be adequate in light of 
current sales forecasts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lending activity at District savings and loan associations continues 
to increase. The volume of mortgage loans rose steadily last year, 
and loan officers expect continued growth throughout 1976. In 
addition, several associations recently reported substantial 
increases in interim construction lending to home builders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage lenders see no letup in the strong pace of savings inflows 
that they have experienced since early 1975. Thus, they expect to be 
able to accommodate increased loan demand without tightening lending 
terms. In fact, nearly half of the associations contacted predicted 
conventional loan rates will drop a quarter of a point by April. A 
leveling-off in the overall cost of savings also eased the upward 
pressure on loan rates, as maturing certificates of deposit are 
being rolled over at substantially lower interest rates. Mortgage 
lenders expressed optimism that their cost of funds would remain 
relatively stable throughout the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Changes in the petrochemical industry are having diverse effects on 
capital spending by the District's largest industrial complex. 
Despite the rollback in domestic oil prices, the drilling boom and 
heavy demand for oil field equipment should continue in 1976. 
Manufacturers of this equipment are operating near peak capacity and 
plan to step up outlays for plant and equipment. Two large equipment 
producers have announced major plant expansions, while several other 
firms will modernize existing facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chemical producers will also continue to invest heavily. Although 
chemical plants valued at an estimated $3 billion are currently 
under construction on the Texas Gulf Coast, the strength of the 
current recovery is expected to strain existing facilities by the 
year-end. Capacity utilization by the largest chemical firm, for 
example, is expected to reach 84 percent, up from 72 percent in 
early 1974. When capacity utilization was above 85 percent in 1973, 
widespread production bottlenecks occurred.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investment by refiners, on the other hand, will be below last year's 
level of spending. As a result of higher costs for petroleum 
products, particularly gasoline, refiners see a
        <br/>
        long-term 
flattening-out in demand for many refinery products, and this has 
led to the downward revision in future refinery capacity needs. A 
number of expansion projects announced over the past few years have 
been canceled. Moreover, a sizable share of this year's outlays are 
for pollution-abatement equipment rather than for expanding 
production facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although steel manufacturers are planning large capital outlays in 
1976, most spending will be to comply with EPA guidelines, rather 
than for much needed improvements in production facilities. The 
District's largest producer, for example, will not spend anything 
for "productive purposes" this year but will continue to spend $1 
million a month for pollution-control equipment. A Fort Worth mill 
scrapped plans for a new furnace but will lay out $3 million for 
pollution-abatement equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent severe cold snap forced natural gas utilities to cut off 
supplies to low-priority industrial users throughout a wide area of 
the Southwest. Gas supplies to high-priority customers, such as 
residential and commercial users, were largely unaffected, although 
schools were forced to close in one large service area. Almost all 
of the industrial plants affected by the cutback in gas service were 
able to switch to standby energy supplies, and very few facilities 
opted to shut down their operations temporarily. With a return to 
more seasonable temperatures, full gas service was restored to all 
customers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Placements of calves in Southwestern feedlots were up nearly 50 
percent in late 1975 over the level of the year before. But bankers 
engaged in financing cattle feeders expect placements to fall 
throughout the first half of 1976, because feed cattle prices have 
continued to edge downward since mid-1975. In the past, declining 
prices would have only a modest effect on placements, since many 
feeders would speculate that prices might improve while their calves 
were on feed. But following the turbulent developments in the 
industry during the past two years, cattle feeders and their bankers 
are much more cautious. A shortage of feeders' calves is also 
expected to hold down future placements. Fall and winter grazing has 
been extremely limited, forcing ranchers to market or slaughter 
calves earlier than normal and thus laying the foundation for the 
future shortage.
