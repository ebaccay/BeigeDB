      Beige Book Report: New York

       May 15, 1974
      </strong>

      <p>
       Second District directors and other business leaders who were 
contacted recently on the whole felt that the recent slowdown in 
business activity would be followed by some improvement in the 
latter part of the year, although some expressed doubts about this 
prognosis. The respondents generally expected further significant 
price increases. Consumer outlays remained relatively strong in the 
New York City area, but some weakening was noted upstate. 
Construction is expected to be further adversely affected by the 
rise in short-term interest rates and the resulting outflow of funds 
from thrift institutions. Views regarding the prospective demand for 
short-term business credit were mixed but on balance pointed to a 
sustained strong demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       The directors in general agreed that the slackening in business 
activity which has occurred in recent months is likely to be 
followed by an improvement as the year wears on. The president of a 
large chemical corporation thus characterized the slack in the 
economy as minor, and the president of a large nationwide retail 
concern looked for some improvement in the second half of the year. 
The president of a multinational nonferrous metal concern expected a 
moderate increase in real GNP for the year as a whole. Another 
director reported strength in the airline, semiconductor, and media 
industries. An upstate banker expected continued strong demand for 
goods and services and expressed the view that, if inflation can be 
controlled, the economy would look much better by the end of 1974 or 
early 1975. Several respondents, however, stressed the uncertainty 
surrounding the prospects for the recovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Among the businessmen who were contacted prior to the termination of 
remaining price controls on April 30, most anticipated a further 
surge in prices—led by copper, steel, and other raw materials—following the already large increases which had occurred during the 
progressive relaxation of controls. Others expected no explosive 
surge in prices as a result of the full elimination of price 
controls, but did look for large selective increases in previously 
controlled areas and more moderate increases elsewhere. The Buffalo 
branch directors contacted during the past week anticipated a 
continuation of upward pressures on prices and wages principally as 
a result of catch-up price increases for those industries where 
price controls had created distortions and where wage and salary 
increases were needed to make up for increases in the cost of living 
that had already occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning consumer spending, a senior official of an upstate 
department store reported some softening in retail sales in western 
New York. However, as noted above, an upstate banker saw a continued 
strong demand for goods and services. Moreover, a recent survey by a 
local newspaper of major New York City department stores with 
branches in the suburbs revealed that April retail sales in the New 
York metropolitan area had been significantly higher than in April 
1973, both in real and in dollar terms, and that most big-store 
executives had become more optimistic regarding the retail sales 
outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the weakest spot in the District's current economic picture 
is found in the construction industry. The respondents expressing an 
opinion on this subject generally expected the rise in short-term 
interest rates to have a serious adverse effect on residential 
construction. The cost of new housing and the shortage of building 
materials continued to be cited as adverse factors. However, 
according to several local savings banks, the major adverse factor 
has now become the unavailability of funds as a result of "severe" 
outflows of funds from thrift institutions to higher yielding money 
market instruments-notably short-term Treasury securities. As a 
result, thrift institutions have substantially tightened their 
already tight lending terms and have become "very selective" in 
making new commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Views were mixed regarding the outlook for demands for short-term 
credit by businesses. A number of observers attributed the very 
strong credit demands of recent months primarily to inventory 
accumulation as a hedge against inflation and shortages. Some felt 
that such demand will taper off. The majority of the respondents, 
however, expected continued strong demands for short-term credit. 
Among those respondents, the president of a large chemical firm thus 
anticipated a continued strong demand for credit stemming from the 
impact of inflationary pressures on business working capital needs, 
and another director felt the same factor would sustain credit 
demands in the agricultural sector. The president of a large 
nonferrous metal producer stated that one factor contributing to the 
demand stemmed from the financing requirements related to the 
extended delays on major industrial construction projects. Another 
director noted that the high rates in the long-term capital markets 
were inducing firms to draw upon their bank lines of credit. The 
need to finance rising accounts receivables was also cited as a 
factor likely to sustain credit demand. There were also reports that 
purchasers of commercial paper have been upgrading their portfolios, 
with the result that firms whose credit ratings fall short of the 
highest rank have found it increasingly difficult to sell commercial 
paper.
