      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Sales by large retailers in major Tenth District cities generally 
  exceeded expectations in October, resulting in a moderately 
  optimistic outlook for the Christmas season. Retail inventories are 
  generally reported to be about right, although a sizable minority of 
  respondents had larger stocks than they desired. Dealers are 
  uniformly optimistic about sales of the 1977 model cars. Plentiful 
  grain stocks and livestock inventories are likely to help hold the 
  increase in food prices down in 1977. Ranchers and cattle feeders 
  are having a difficult time and—along with wheat farmers 
  withholding grain from market—are a source of higher loan demand at 
  District banks. Otherwise, bankers report only a stable loan demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large retailers in major cities in the Tenth District generally 
  report sales in October to have exceeded expectations, following 
  somewhat weaker September sales. (Exceptions were not uniform with 
  regard either to type of store or to geographic location.) The 
  improved October performance has apparently resulted in some 
  increased optimism for sales in the Christmas season, although the 
  degree of optimism can only be described as moderate overall. One 
  large catalog sales company reports that its Christmas sales are 
  ahead of its expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      With few exceptions, stores reporting on relative strength or 
  weakness of various product lines noted greater strength for 
  durables than for nondurable goods. Appliances, home improvement 
  items, and auto accessories were identified among durables selling 
  well; the, picture for other home furnishings was mixed. Sales of 
  both men's and women's clothes were generally reported to be strong, 
  although some instances of weakness in women's apparel sales were 
  reported.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most retailers described their inventories as being about at the 
  level they wanted them. One respondent described his stocks as "right for expected sales;" another indicated that inventories had 
  been too heavy until his store's October sales increase. A sizable 
  minority of respondents reported larger stocks than desired, 
  however.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly all retailers contacted spoke of a steady pattern of price 
  increases for the things they buy, but with no unusual or 
  outstanding price rises. Several respondents indicated that their 
  own markups are holding steady. Retailers in the Tenth District 
  report that the United Parcel Service strike has had very little 
  impact, or none at all, on their operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sellers of domestic new automobiles in the Tenth District are 
  uniformly optimistic about sales of the 1977 model cars. Full-sized 
  and intermediate-sized cars are selling best; sales of compacts and 
  subcompacts are still weak. Most dealers continue to sell cars 
  heavily loaded with optional equipment. New car inventories are 
  generally low, with few exceptions; this goes beyond Ford dealers 
  still feeling the impact of the strike. Dealers generally report 
  that 1977 model sales would be better if their inventory situation 
  were better.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although farm prices fell 5 per cent during the month ended October 
  15 to a level 9 per cent below a year ago, price gains during the 
  first half of the year will hold the 1976 average very close to the 
  figure for 1975. Food prices, therefore, have exhibited greater 
  stability this year than in the previous 3 years—rising an 
  estimated 3 to 4 per cent. Recent reports on grain stocks and 
  livestock inventories suggest that food supplies will remain 
  plentiful at least until midyear 1977, which should help keep the 
  lid on food prices. Most of next year's pressures on food prices are 
  likely to arise from probable increases in marketing charges for 
  labor, processing, packaging and the like. As a result, some 
  acceleration in the rate of increase for food prices seems likely in 
  1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      This has been a difficult year for ranchers and cattle feeders in 
  the Tenth District. Agricultural bankers responding to the October 1 
  agricultural credit survey indicated only 13 per cent of their 
  rancher and feeder customers would increase their net worths this 
  year, while 50 per cent expected a decline. A large percentage of 
  those expecting increases or no change in net worths attributed this 
  solely to higher land values. One banker noted, "The land value 
  increase is about the only answer to holding property statements 
  together."
     </p>
     <p>
      Higher input costs, low cattle prices, and slow selling by wheat 
  farmers—who are holding crops for better prices—have resulted in 
  markedly higher farm loan demand in the Tenth District from a year 
  ago. Over 72 per cent of the bankers reported an increase in loan 
  demand, and 39 per cent noted a decrease in loanable funds. Lower 
  rates of loan repayments and more loan renewals or extensions were 
  noted by just over half the bankers. These trends were particularly 
  noticeable in the cattle and wheat raising areas of the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Total loans increased at Tenth District banks in October. However, 
  bankers contacted for the survey reported only a stable loan demand. 
  Most stated that they would like to build up their business loans 
  and are actively seeking new corporate customers. They reported 
  normal to good automobile sales for their areas, but most stated 
  that their automobile loans had not increased because their terms 
  were not competitive with other automobile financers. One banker 
  reported a brisk pick up in loans to retailers due to earlier than 
  usual shipments of Christmas merchandise.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent declines in the prime rate have resulted in pressure on 
  earnings for several banks. These bankers stated they were trying to 
  trim their costs primarily by reducing overhead. Also, they have 
  lowered their rates on large CD's and reduced their purchases of 
  Federal funds. Bankers are reluctant to reduce the rate on consumer-type time accounts from the maximums because of the competition for 
  these deposits.
