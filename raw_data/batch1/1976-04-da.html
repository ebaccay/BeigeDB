      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      With the exception of a few problem areas highlighted in this 
  report, the economic recovery is progressing reasonably well in the 
  Eleventh District. Evidence of the expanding economy can be seen in 
  most labor market statistics. Total employment has increased by 
  100,000 workers in the five-state area in the past year, and the 
  unemployment rate has dropped to 6.2 percent. Only in Oklahoma has 
  the jobless rate increased, while in Arizona the rate has dropped 
  3.5 percentage points. In Texas, insured unemployment has declined 
  39 percent since last June. Moreover, initial claims for 
  unemployment insurance are now at the lowest level since October 
  1974, The recovery in manufacturing in Texas is reflected by the 
  extended workweek for production workers, which, at 41.0 hours, 
  equals the annual averages for 1972 and 1973.
     </p>
     <p>
      The only manufacturing industry in Texas that has not participated 
  in the economic recovery is primary metals. Output by the industry 
  has dropped nearly a third since September 1974, but the decline now 
  appears to be leveling off. A survey of steel companies in the 
  industry indicates most firms are hoping for a slow pickup in 
  business later this year, but this outlook depends on the 
  performance of two major markets—construction and oil field 
  equipment. Some steel companies note the market for materials used 
  in small residential construction projects has firmed. However, 
  total output will not be affected substantially until nonresidential 
  construction begins a comeback. But even stronger demand for
  construction materials may not help the steel industry because as 
  much as three-fourths of the current production of some firms goes 
  into oil field equipment manufacturing which is now beginning to 
  soften. In addition, aluminum output continues at the low level 
  established last summer.
     </p>
     <p>
      Domestic drilling activity has taken a turn for the worse. After 
  reaching a 14-year high in late December, the total number of active 
  rotary drilling rigs dropped 16 percent to a 17-month low in March. 
  A seasonal decline in drilling is expected in the first quarter of 
  each year; but according to some industry spokesmen, the cutback was 
  also in response to a rollback in the average price of domestic 
  crude oil to $7.66 a barrel—down from the January high of $8.43. 
  Many drilling contractors expect the decline to slow and drilling to 
  begin a seasonal upswing in the last half of the year. However, the 
  future is clouded by proposed legislation that is unfavorable to the 
  industry. Despite the sharp drop in rig count, more wells were 
  completed in the first quarter of 1976 than in the comparable period 
  last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Multi-family construction in the Eleventh District remains severely 
  depressed by high interest rates and rising construction costs. As a 
  result, a growing shortage of apartment units, already acute in some 
  District cities, has caused some major changes in the rental market. 
  In Houston, for example, where the occupancy rate is 95 percent, 
  tenant resistance to fast-rising rents, discontinuance of lease 
  contracts, and payment of their own utility bills has become 
  virtually nonexistent.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tight rental market is, however, boosting the demand for new 
  single-family homes. Sales of new houses are near record levels, 
  according to a survey of the District's largest tract builders. 
  Demand is strongest for homes priced under $30,000, and most are 
  being sold to apartment dwellers. In addition, new developments are 
  mushrooming in suburbs 15 to 30 miles from the central business 
  districts because fears of gasoline shortages and the inconvenience 
  of commuting have been overcome.
     </p>
     <p>
      Custom builders specializing in more expensive homes are also 
  experiencing brisk sales. Roughly half the new homes sold in Dallas 
  this year have been priced over $40,000. And in El Paso, demand for 
  homes costing more than $50,000 is the strongest in several years.
     </p>
     <p>
      None of the builders contacted considered their inventories of 
  unsold homes excessive. In fact, a common response was that 
  inventories were "very low." In Dallas, for example, the largest 
  homebuilder said that there were 2,660 new homes on the market last 
  quarter and about 1,750 were sold. He considers inventories tight if 
  he carries less than a
      <br/>
      six-month's supply of homes. Builders also 
  report that as a result of the short supply of homes, most recent 
  sales have been "futures"—houses not yet completed. And they have 
  responded to this bullish development by substantially increasing 
  their plans for additional starts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Farm income in the Southwest will be higher this quarter than a year 
  ago. Prices received by Texas farmers for all agricultural products 
  are up 17 percent, on average, from last year. With higher average 
  cattle and calf prices, total livestock receipts will be bolstered 
  by increased marketing of cattle from feedlots and increased numbers 
  of grass-fed cattle and calves slaughtered. Receipts from hogs, 
  milk, and broilers may also rise. But total crop receipts—reflecting very weak rice and soybean prices—may remain near year-earlier levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prices paid by farmers for most production items have increased 8 
  percent in the last year. Costs of feed, fuel and motor supplies, 
  farm machinery, building and fencing materials, and farm supplies 
  should continue to increase moderately, while irrigation costs in 
  areas of West Texas and Eastern New Mexico will be significantly 
  higher. Fertilizer prices, however, are below year-earlier levels, 
  encouraging extensive application of crop land and improved pastures 
  where adequate moisture is available.
