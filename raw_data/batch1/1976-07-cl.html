      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Activity in the Fourth District is marked by slowing gains in 
  manufacturing, some revival in retail sales, and spotty recovery in 
  capital goods. Directors and other respondents still report no 
  shortages nor are any expected in the near future, although supplies 
  of some types of steel, plastics and packaging materials have 
  tightened. Deposit inflows at thrift institutions have slowed 
  sharply, and expectations are that mortgage interest rates will rise 
  unless deposit growth strengthens.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retailers report a pickup in June sales, following two monthly 
  declines. Although they view the revival with some skepticism, they 
  remain cautiously optimistic that near-term prospects for consumer 
  spending remain favorable. A director associated with a major 
  national retail chain said orders placed by department stores are 
  reportedly very high, but a few retailers apparently have lowered 
  their commitments for future delivery. An economist associated with 
  a major retailer is skeptical about the June recovery because of the 
  spotty nature of the pickup (apparel and soft goods still weak, 
  furniture sales strong) and the need for sales promotions to induce 
  consumer response. He expects sales gains will not be as large as he 
  estimated a few months ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      In contrast, an economist with a large producer of major appliances 
  views the recent decline in retail sales as temporary and expects a 
  second wave of rapid expansion later in 1976. He attributed the 
  spring slowdown to emerging price resistance by consumers, 
  flattening in housing starts and an ending to the effects of tax 
  cuts early in 1975.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in capital goods remains mixed. Two large producers of 
  machine tools report orders in recent months have exceeded shipments 
  for the first time since mid-1974. Heavy-duty truck sales picked up 
  last quarter from near trough lows, according to a major supplier in 
  the industry. A producer of earthmoving equipment for mining, 
  construction and logging industries continues to lay off workers and 
  will suspend operations for at least a month over July and August 
  for lack of orders. Another major capital goods producer, where 
  orders so far in 1976 have risen only about 3 percent from 1975, 
  reports inquiries have increased, indicating a step-up in orders 
  later in 1976. That firm's capital spending plans for this year are 
  below last year's outlays. Its major capital investment program 
  includes purchasing a mining company as a hedge against expected 
  rising prices for basic materials. Projections of a high rate of 
  inflation, relatively slow growth in economic activity, and adequate 
  capacity in its industry are among the reasons cited for its 
  conservative spending plans over the next few years. A director with 
  a diversified firm also indicated his company's capital spending for 
  1976 will be considerably less than previously anticipated, but can 
  be boosted quickly depending upon the strength of customer demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is yet little indication of shortages or bottlenecks in any of 
  the key manufacturing industries in the District, although steel, 
  plastics and packaging industries are tight in some product lines. 
  Major steel producers in the District report order books for flat 
  rolled products are full for the third quarter. One mill apparently 
  turned away some business that was later placed with other domestic 
  sources. Demand for other steel products, such as plates, structural 
  steel and pipe, remains weak. Steel operations will drop less than 
  usual for the summer months; operations will likely remain close to 
  90 percent of capacity, except that some mills may temporarily shut 
  down for needed repairs. One of the largest producers does not 
  expect to boost capital outlays until 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      A director described the supply of raw materials as adequate for the 
  near term. Coke and iron ore are potential sources of problems for 
  steel producers. One steel economist expects no shortages of raw 
  materials this year, but said a coke shortage may surface in 1977 
  because of environmental constraints. Another economist said that 
  inability to meet environmental standards may require his company to 
  shut down ore mines in Minnesota. Three domestic steel producers and 
  a prominent ore producer announced joint plans to sharply boost 
  pellitized ore capacity, but production would not be available until 
  late 1979 or early 1980.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 2 1/2-month-old rubber strike is still not expected to shut down 
  the auto industry, according to an economist associated with a major 
  tire producer. The rubber industry continues to operate at about 50 
  percent of capacity but is expected to operate at 100 percent for at 
  least a year following contract settlement. Contract talks appear 
  deadlocked, but he pointed out that loss of medical, life insurance, 
  and accident benefits, which expire next week, might speed up 
  settlement.
     </p>
     <p>
      Supplies of several types of nondurable goods, including food, 
  packaging and paperboard, are judged to be adequate but supplies of 
  glass containers and plastics are tightening. A director remarked 
  that capacity in the food processing industry is adequate. Glass 
  container producers are expected to operate close to capacity in 
  1976, although supplies of these containers are described as tight 
  but not critical. No shortage is expected in 1976 or 1977, in part 
  because of the substitution of metal for glass containers. The 
  paperboard industry is operating at about 91 percent of capacity, 
  well below the 1974 peak, but supplies are expected to tighten as 
  the industry approaches 100 percent operations later next year. 
  Capacity additions in packing and paperboard industries in the last 
  few years have been small because of the high cost of building new 
  plants.
     </p>
     <p>
      Polyvinyl chloride is in tight supply. One major producer is 
  operating at about 90 percent of effective capacity compared with 80 
  percent in the first quarter of 1976. Effective capacity of the 
  industry, although higher than during the peak in 1973-1974, has 
  been reduced because of environmental constraints. Sources 
  associated with the industry expect no shortages such as were 
  experienced during the last peak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial officers associated with savings and loans report a 
  seasonal to larger-than-seasonal slowing of deposit inflows in June. 
  Mortgage loan demand is described as heavy. The view of two 
  officials is that mortgage rates will rise unless demand softens or 
  deposits grow as rapidly as they did earlier in 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business loan demand at banks is described as flat to weak by two 
  directors. A director with a large bank attributes continued weak 
  loan demand to corporate use of long-term debt and equity markets, 
  the sluggish pace of capital spending and tight inventory control by 
  business firms.
