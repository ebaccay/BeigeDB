       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Comments on economic conditions in the twelve Federal Reserve 
Districts indicate that in most Districts bankers and businessmen 
find economic activity has been weakening, and they generally 
expected the decline will continue. In virtually all Districts, 
unemployment is rising, and in many, labor markets are easing 
noticeably. Retail trade is weaker almost everywhere, and consumers 
are "downgrading" and 
bargain-hunting. A few Districts report large 
cuts in capital spending. In a number of Districts, special note was 
made of the profit squeeze that is affecting many businesses, and in 
some, concern was expressed about a decline in corporate liquidity. 
Mention was again made in several Districts of the dangers from wage 
and price developments, and in four Districts a substantial number 
of respondents reportedly favor some sort of incomes policy.
     </p>
     <p>
      In only one Federal Reserve District, St. Louis, was recent economic 
activity regarded as "good"; and in Kansas City it was deemed fair 
to good. In most Districts, activity has weakened significantly, and 
a decline in new orders was noted in three Districts. Expectations 
of a further decline are widespread. These range, however, from the 
belief that the bottom will come in the third or fourth quarter of 
this year, to the belief of the directors of the Cleveland Federal 
Reserve Bank that the contraction will be "more prolonged and deeper 
than most economists and public policy makers are currently 
expecting".
     </p>
     <p>
      A growth in unemployment is noticeable throughout the country, in 
some Districts only mildly, but in others strongly. Until recently, 
many firms were reducing their work forces simply by letting 
"attrition" take its toll, but now firms are "furloughing" workers, 
"cutting back" their staffs, and "pushing" early retirements. In a. 
few Districts, even "quality" labor has begun to be available. An 
easier market is noted for, among others, "middle management" and 
"professional" types and one District remarked upon an "extremely 
sharp increase" in unsolicited summaries from applicants with 
"extensive experience".
     </p>
     <p>
      Very few exceptions were noted to the general pattern of weakness in 
retail sales and of "downgrading" and bargain hunting. Department 
stores seemed to be particularly hard hit by the softening of 
demand, while discount stores and "bargain basements" were holding 
up well. Weakness was particularly strong in furniture, appliances, 
television sets, and clothing. Auto buying was an area where 
"downgrading" was especially intense—except in Dallas. The trend 
was heavily to cheaper models, stripped-down models, "compacts", 
low-priced imports, and late-model used cars. Outside the auto 
field, in the few Districts where no "downgrading" was apparent, 
consumers nevertheless had a sharp eye out for "sales" and 
"specials". In the San Francisco District, a "strong" demand for 
mobile homes was interpreted as possibly a form of "downgrading".
     </p>
     <p>
      In two Districts, Richmond and St. Louis, capital spending plans 
continue strong, out of "fear" of inflation or to offset increased 
labor costs. However, in the five other Districts that made 
reference to the subject, many firms are making substantial 
cutbacks. Among the comments: General Motors is making "huge" 
cutbacks, a "large retail organization" is cutting back by 50 
percent, a "large oil company" is "continuously" reviewing its 
plans, in the Philadelphia District there has been a "marked" 
cutback since April, and in the New York District some firms are 
reviewing their plans for the "second or third time this year".
     </p>
     <p>
      Inventory holdings were specifically mentioned by half of the 
Districts. They were regarded as "excessive" in two of the 
Districts, and were being "reduced" in a third. In two others they 
were at a "satisfactory" level, partly because firms were working on 
a "hand-to-mouth" basis. In another District, reference was to 
merchandising firms, which were being "extremely cautious" regarding 
their fall and winter stocks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The profit squeeze is hitting many businesses very hard in many 
parts of the country. The situation is aggravated by a liquidity 
squeeze. Slow payment on accounts receivable was mentioned by both 
Chicago and New York as one of the reasons for this latter 
development. Because of their uncomfortable situation, many business 
firms have embarked on cost-cutting programs (including the 
reduction of staffs, of inventories, of advertising, and of capital 
spending). In the New York District, it was reported that many 
companies may not be able to "meet their maturities" and that some 
"substantial" companies would be unable to "meet their payrolls 
without refinancing". The liquidity squeeze is having repercussions 
in the commercial paper market. Some commercial paper dealers have 
told corporate customers they can no longer handle their issues. 
Among financial concerns that are troubled by their own liquidity 
situation are some life insurance companies. The latter were 
reported as wishing to increase their liquidity and therefore not 
seeking any new long-term investment outlets.
     </p>
     <p>
      Concern about continuing inflationary pressures, particularly 
arising from large wage hikes, was mentioned in several Districts, 
although some price declines were noted in Cleveland (machine tool 
and aluminum industries) and in Richmond (textiles and furniture). 
Respondents in some Districts expressed disillusionment with 
"conventional" stabilization measures or with the "Administration's 
economic policies", and a few Districts reported there was 
considerable sentiment in favor of some kind of incomes policy. In 
one District it was reported that some labor leaders noted 
confidentially that guidelines would provide them with"an excuse to 
argue for lower wage settlements" than their members are currently 
ready to consider.
