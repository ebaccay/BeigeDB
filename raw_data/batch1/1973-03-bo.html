      Beige Book Report: Boston

      <strong>
       March 14, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Our business directors report that business continues to be very 
good in all lines, but a bank director notes growing fears of 
disintermediation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Business is reported as so good that firms have been unable to build 
inventories to desired levels. Machinery lines especially are under 
pressure. Order backlogs for heavy machinery are reported by one 
director as the highest in company history, and another director 
notes that his machinery division is sold out through the end of the 
year. Concern was voiced about inadequate facilities to handle 
machinery orders and about complaints from customers over long 
delivery times. Aircraft orders from the airlines, general aviation, 
and the military are reported as up for both new designs and 
replacement engines. One manufacturer of general aviation aircraft 
notes that order backlogs are at record levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the consumer goods area, a manufacturer of boats and campers 
notes that the industry is expecting a very good year. Tire sales 
are strong, and there is less worry now in the industry about a 
major strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       One director noted that the devaluation was going to raise metal 
prices and that the company would have to raise the prices of its 
nickel-based products and other superalloys. This director mentioned 
a rumor about Phase Three controls which would prevent a company 
from passing on devaluation changes by scrutinizing costs in its 
overall operations, including foreign divisions, rather than 
continuing the present practice of separating out domestic 
operations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pressures in the financial area were noted by a bank director. 
Savings deposits slowed dramatically and just covered dividend 
payments in February, raising fears of disintermediation. The drop 
in savings flows was especially noticeable in deposits of over 
$50,000 where rate ceilings continue to prevent banks from 
effectively competing for funds. This New Hampshire banker noted 
that business loan demand remains strong and that his bank is fully 
loaned. A business director mentioned that renewed concern about a 
credit crunch has led a number of firms to take down big lines of 
credit at commercial banks just in case they cannot use the 
commercial paper market. Another director, however, noted that 
rising interest rates this year will not have the cost impact that 
they did in the last credit crunch, because the cost of new debt 
will not be substantially higher than the present imbedded cost of 
debt. In the last period of monetary restraint, when the cost of new 
debt was over 7 percent and imbedded debt costs were 3 percent, 
borrowing substantially raised business costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This latter director also expressed the opinion that the current 
hysteria about inflation, as evidenced in the stock market, is 
unfounded. While prices will rise more this year than in 1972 and 
wage contracts will be higher under Phase Three than in Phase Two, 
he felt that unions would not be seeking exorbitant wage increases 
for fear of bringing back Phase One-type controls.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professors Eckstein, Samuelson, and Shapiro were available for 
comment this month. All felt the major problem for the economy is to 
get Phase Three "off the ground". Shapiro criticized the strange and 
contradictory statements about Phase Three which have been made by 
members of the Administration. He urges greater clarification. He 
cited the relatively flat yield curve as evidence that "people with 
money do not have inflationary expectations". Due to a lot of bad 
luck (weather conditions and blight) and high income elasticity of 
the demand for meat, Samuelson doubts prices can be held to the 
stated goals. Specifically, the 5.5 percent wage standard is not 
possible to achieve, given the recent and likely future path of the 
cost of living. On the other hand, cost-push inflation is not 
something that the monetary authorities can or ought to do a lot 
about, according to Samuelson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Samuelson also felt it inadvisable to be committed to a dollar 
parity rate at the cost of tighter interest rates than would be 
justified on the grounds of domestic policy. While Shapiro would 
have preferred to have let the dollar float, he urged the United 
States to stand firm in not supporting the dollar, forcing other 
countries to take either goods or dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The general monetary policy prescriptions were the same as in 
previous reports. Samuelson argues there is reason to be tighter now 
than may be appropriate in eight months; Eckstein continues to 
advocate steady reserves growth. Given the minimum amount of 
"creeping inflation" we can expect, Samuelson believes that the 
long-run target growth rate of nominal gross national product (GNP) 
must be at least 7 percent and that a 5 percent rate of growth of Ml 
would squeeze the real system. Eckstein warmly applauded Chairman 
Burns' recent statement before the Joint Economic Committee. In a 
memorandum to his subscribers, Eckstein cited approvingly the 
statement that "the Federal Reserve does not intend to permit severe 
stringency's to develop in the credit markets, or try to correct for 
every error in public or private policies". Nevertheless, he 
expressed some concern that financial stringency will develop and 
urged the system to monitor carefully the financial system to see 
"where it breaks" since "it breaks different places every time". 
Past "crunches" appeared after a period of restraint, when the Fed 
did not anticipate the degree of stringency which did develop. He 
has confidence that "we have learned how to apply the monetary 
brakes gently".
