      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       July 10, 1974
      </strong>

      <p>
       Manufacturing activity in the District apparently strengthened in 
June for the third straight month; supplies of raw materials 
generally remain tight. Capital spending and steel production are 
key supports of industrial activity, while weakness in retail sales 
is contributing to an overhang of inventories. Savings and loan 
associations in northeast Ohio report large withdrawals of deposits 
since the third week in June.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early returns from our monthly survey of District manufacturers 
indicate that the recovery continued in June for the third 
consecutive month. All key series posted further gains. Inventory 
accumulation, however, has shown signs of slowing in recent months. 
Price increases remain pervasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of our industrialist directors in capital goods industries 
report a recent easing in the supply situation for a few materials. 
As a general matter, however, the availability of raw materials 
continues to be tight. One director commented that they still have a 
"lot of people out on the road rounding up raw materials at whatever 
price they have to pay." Business conditions in the capital goods 
industries remain good, and backlogs are still rising. A director in 
the machine tool industry said they are now quoting some machinery 
for delivery in late 1976. The industrialists mentioned that the 
high cost of money is beginning to be a major problem for their 
firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Petrochemical products, steel, and coal continue to be commodities 
in tight supply. An economist for a major petrochemical firm in the 
District remarked that removal of price controls has done little to 
improve the supply of basic materials they use. The improvement that 
has occurred in availability stems from a reduced volume of exports. 
He anticipates no softening in demand for plastic and chemical 
products and reports that his firm is allocating orders based on 73-75 percent of 1973 sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Casting and steel products remain in tight supply and an official 
with an automotive supplier reports that his firm has been 
reallocating materials in critical supply from one plant to another 
in order to maintain production schedules. Steel economists report 
that demand for steel continues to exceed supply and that situation 
could tighten further because of equipment bottlenecks and coal 
shortages. One major producer reports that a breakdown in equipment 
sharply curtailed their raw steel output in the Youngstown District 
during most of June. Lower quality of coal has also held down steel 
output, and suppliers have not been able to fill long-term contracts 
for coal. Another steel producer apparently has sufficient supplies 
of coal to last through July. But company officials are concerned 
that low coal stocks will curtail operations in the event of a mine 
strike. The company's economist also asserted that the latest round 
of steel price increases was aimed at improving profit margins 
necessary to finance capital expansion programs. Previous increases 
were to recover higher costs that were not permitted to be fully 
passed on to steel consumers during wage-price controls. Despite 
four increases in steel mill products so far this year, domestic 
prices for steel are still well below average world prices for 
steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coal supplies are tight. Demand from utilities and steel industries 
remains strong, and both of these users report unusually low stocks 
of coal, which would disrupt their operations in the event of a coal 
strike in November. An economist with a major coal producing firm 
considers it likely that miners will strike for at least two weeks 
but not more than four weeks when their contract expires in 
November. Freight car shortages are a limiting factor in coal 
output.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales of two large department store chains in Ohio showed 
little improvement in June, and officials with these firms were 
pessimistic about second half sales. The president of a major 
department store chain in Cleveland stated that consumers' buying 
interest must be "stirred" by frequent sales promotions, and that 
collections have slowed while delinquencies have been rising. He 
reported that his stores' inventories are now excessive and that the 
usual summer clearance sales dates were advanced this year in order 
to attract consumer buying. In contrast to his cautiously optimistic 
tone of two months ago, he sees little basis for improvement in 
retail sales unless real purchasing power picks up sharply and 
financial developments take a turn for the better. An economist with 
another major department store chain also reported that consumer 
buying remains sluggish. He asserted that consumers have traded down 
in quality and have not reduced unit purchases as much as suggested 
in the deflated retail sales data. He feels that retail inventories 
are now excessive, whereas as recently as April, his sales 
management complained of inventory shortages. "In less than a few 
months, we moved from scarcities to excesses of all kinds." He 
expects unit sales to fall by about 1 percent during the second half 
of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some banking directors report they are becoming increasingly 
selective in accommodating loan demand; more loan applications 
(business, real estate, consumer installment) are being turned down. 
An economist with a major bank in Cleveland stated that demand for 
mortgage loans remains strong despite further tightening of loan 
terms (down payment of 25 percent for 20 year loans). He reported 
loan demand from finance companies and commercial loans remain 
strong. An investment officer with another bank in Cleveland 
expressed concern that the floating rate note of Citicorp would 
attract savings deposits from deposit type institutions. It was 
remarked that the Cleveland office of First Boston Corp. has sold 
out their $28 million allotment of these notes, the bulk of which, 
according to a local broker, would be financed by withdrawals of 
deposits from savings and loan associations. The investment officer 
was also concerned that major money market banks in the country 
would be the only institutions able to roll over CD's that will be 
maturing in the weeks ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings deposits in S&amp;Ls in northeast Ohio about equaled 
withdrawals since the third week in June, according to an official 
in the savings and loan trade association. S&amp;Ls are making very 
few new mortgage commitments. Mortgage terms generally range from 9-1/4 percent to 9-1/2 percent (plus one point) based on 20 percent 
down payment, and applications exceed ability to make loans. S&amp;Ls 
have stepped up their marketing programs to attract depositors with 
a variety of gifts. Two S&amp;Ls in Cleveland are now offering 
services similar to checking accounts, with another advertising no 
fee checking to depositors with $250 in savings accounts plus an 
additional monthly deposit of $25 or a $1,000 initial deposit. The 
chairman of a $150 million S&amp;L in Cleveland reported that 
customers' response to their variable mortgage rate, which is now 
about 1/4 percent below the prevailing market rate in Cleveland, has 
been good but less than expected.
