      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Our May survey of Fifth District business conditions shows April to 
  have been another month of widespread upward movement in the level 
  of business activity. Manufacturers surveyed report increased 
  shipments and new orders and larger backlogs of orders in April. 
  Manufacturers' inventories showed little change as more than one-fourth of the respondents continue to view current levels as 
  excessive. Employment continues to increase across the District as 
  indicated by our survey as well as by reports on employment and 
  unemployment in the individual states. District retailers have 
  apparently experienced a dramatic turnaround in their business. Most 
  firms reported increased sales and several characterized the 
  increases as substantial. Sales of big ticket items continued their 
  relative improvement despite the large increase in total sales. The 
  latest available information reveals no significant recovery in 
  business loan applications at District banks. Low credit line 
  utilization, generally below 30 percent, noted by several banks 
  illustrates the extent of weakness in short-tern business lending. 
  With April's dry weather and below-freezing temperatures, small 
  grains, spring-planted crops, and fruit were damaged in wide areas 
  of the District. Replanting of some spring crops has been necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the manufacturers responding to our May survey, over 40 percent 
  reported increased shipments in April, while nearly one-half 
  experienced a larger volume of new orders than in March. Backlogs of 
  orders apparently increased somewhat, although fewer respondents 
  reported such increases this month than did so one month ago. 
  Inventories showed little change, a slight increase in stocks of 
  materials being balanced by a small reduction in finished goods. 
  Over one-half of the manufacturers now view current inventory levels 
  as about right, but those feeling current stocks are excessive 
  continued to outnumber those viewing them as inadequate by almost 
  two to one. Gains in shipments and new orders are evident in such 
  industries as textiles, apparel, primary metals, and furniture. 
  While the situation appears to have stabilized in some other 
  industries, including chemicals, responses do not yet suggest any 
  significant improvement. Non-electrical machinery and equipment 
  seems to have leveled off somewhat after some improvement in March, 
  but the electrical equipment group did show some improvement after 
  lagging in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nearly one-third of the manufacturers surveyed report expanded 
  employment and longer workweeks in April. Prices also continued to 
  rise during the survey period. Survey responses reveal dwindling 
  dissatisfaction with current plant and equipment capacity. Over 
  three-fourths of the respondents feel current capacity is about 
  right. There remains virtually no sentiment for altering current 
  expansion plans. A substantial majority of the manufacturers 
  surveyed, however, expect continued improvement in the general level 
  of business activity, nationally, locally, and in their respective 
  firms, over the next six months.
     </p>
     <p>
      The responses of retailers surveyed suggest substantial improvement 
  in business over the past month. Several respondents specifically 
  mentioned the size of the month to month increase in sales calling 
  it the "best ever" or the "best in twenty years." One large chain 
  store responded that "everything is selling." Sales of big ticket 
  items relative to total sales continued to increase despite the 
  sizable gains in total sales. Seventy-five percent of our retail 
  respondents also reported increases in inventories in April. 
  Meanwhile, twenty-five percent of the respondents once again view 
  current inventory levels as excessive. Over one-third, however, feel 
  the current number and size of outlets is now inadequate.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment by retailers rose in April as did employee compensation. 
  Over one-half of the respondents feel that level of sales in their 
  firms will continue to improve over the next six months. The others 
  are apparently satisfied with the current level and feel that while 
  it can be sustained, any further improvements are not likely. In 
  general, the retailers, like the manufacturers, expect the general 
  level of business activity to continue to improve.
     </p>
     <p>
      Of the District banks surveyed in late April none has experienced 
  any significant recovery in business loan applications, either 
  short-term or long-term. Weakness in short-term financing, however, 
  is especially evident in the larger national accounts. The outlook 
  for improvement in business loan demand is uncertain. Most banks are "hopeful" of a turnaround in 3-6 months, and recovery is expected 
  first in the short-term area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Earnings from farm marketings during the first two months of 1976 
  ran slightly below a year ago in the District, compared with a gain 
  of about 10 percent nationally. Farmland values rose further during 
  the period March 1975 to February 1976. Unlike the national advance 
  which was about the same as in the previous year, the increase among 
  District states was slower than recent year-to-year gains in 
  Virginia and the Carolinas but the highest on record in Maryland and 
  the second highest in West Virginia.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reacting to market conditions, District farmers now intend to plant 
  more cotton, corn and other feed grains, but fewer soybeans, than 
  they planned in January. Compared with a year ago, April 1 
  intentions indicated sizable increases in plantings of corn and 
  cotton but significant cuts in soybean and flue-cured tobacco 
  acreage.
