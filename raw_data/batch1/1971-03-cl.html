      Beige Book Report: Cleveland

       March 9, 1971
      </strong>

      <p>
       The consensus view of an informal survey of several of our directors 
is that there is a considerable amount of optimistic talk about the 
economic outlook at the senior management level in major firms in 
the Fourth District and elsewhere. The optimism, however, is 
tempered with caution resulting from a lack of specific evidence 
signaling an upturn in overall activity or at the individual firm 
level. As a result, many firms, especially capital goods producers, 
are pessimistic about a quick resurgence in economic activity, but 
expectations of improvement near the end of 1971 or in early 1972 
are reported to be widespread.
      </p>
      <p>
       One director, the president of a large manufacturer of computers and 
business machines, reported that the ready availability of credit, 
declining interest rates, and expectation of stimulative fiscal 
policy in fiscal 1972 have generated some optimism, although many 
businessmen remain uncertain about the time paths of the expected 
recovery. The key element in the business picture, according to this 
director, is the consumer. Once consumer spending picks up and 
utilization of existing plant and equipment returns to near-capacity 
levels, business spending for additional plant and equipment will 
increase and the recovery process will be underway. This director 
indicated that sales of cash register equipment have held up 
relatively well, in spite of numerous postponements of new store 
locations by major retail chains. Computer sales, on the other hand, 
have been severely depressed and are not expected to recover until 
yearend or early 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       A second director, who is the chairman of a large diversified 
manufacturing firm (major divisions include auto components, defense 
and space products, and electronics), expressed the view that 
economic activity will probably improve during 1971. He also 
reported that there are a number of favorable "straws in the wind" 
from his firm's point of view: consumer-oriented products (radio and 
TV parts and auto components) have picked up; orders for offshore 
oil drilling equipment have risen; sales of automated supervisory 
control equipment have edged up slightly; and Government related 
business has increased modestly. Furthermore, this director 
expressed continued concern about inflation and indicated that he 
has expressed directly to senior Administration officials strong 
support for the Government's actions in the construction industry. 
He is convinced that the persistent irritation is the result of 
cost-push pressures. Some prices have declined and he believes that 
excess capacity and competition would force businessmen to be more 
responsive in pricing policies in the absence of continued excessive 
wage demands. This director also expressed the view that consumer 
confidence is precariously balanced and that further "bad news" or 
unexpected shocks could further undermine consumer confidence and, 
thus, hamper the expected recovery in economic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       A third director, the president of a major glassware and glass 
container firm, reported that their new order backlog for consumer 
glassware is slightly higher than the year-ago level, reflecting an 
increase in orders from retail chains. Glass container orders are 
about equal to the early 1970 level. Orders for and shipments of 
industrial glassware, especially home lighting equipment, are 
significantly above last year's level, as a result of the "boom" in 
housing. This director also referred to the "apparent optimism," but 
indicated that his own situation is very quiet, "we're waiting" and 
"there is nothing stirring."
      </p>
      <p>
       A fourth director, the president of a medium-sized machine tool 
manufacturing firm, reported that industry leaders are more 
optimistic about the chances of a recovery in business and in demand 
for machine tools by the end of 1971 or early 1972 than they were 
two or three months ago. The renewed optimism is based, in part, on 
current and expected stabilization policies and also on a recent 
sharp increase in requests from customers to see salesmen. So far, 
however, the flurry of activity has not been translated into an 
increase in new orders. At the present time, order backlogs for the 
industry are at the lowest level in several years, incoming orders 
are dismal, and as a result, employment has been sharply curtailed.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the financial side, two bank directors have expressed strong 
sentiments to the effect that the System has gone "far enough" in 
reducing interest rates and they are prepared to oppose any further 
reductions in the discount rate. One banker-director, the chairman 
of one of the largest banks in the District, expressed grave concern 
about the international repercussions of any further easing in 
monetary policy, indicating that foreign central bankers will "... 
not fool around with us." This banker reported no pickup in business 
loan demand. This director also serves as a member of the Board of 
Directors of several national firms, and he reports that the 
management of these firms has no expectations of a quick turnaround 
in activity in the immediate future, especially in the manufacturing 
area.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second banker-director, the chairman of a medium-sized bank in 
the District, was opposed to any further easing of monetary policy 
in psychological grounds. He reported strongly held convictions that 
consumer spending will not surge upward as long as there is a 
feeling that "... everything is going down." Banks have more than 
enough funds, interest rates keep falling, and individuals in his 
area are very concerned about reaching some sort of "bottom" from 
which a recovery can start. This director would like the System to 
hold steady on its present course (as he perceives it) and permit 
the recovery to unfold. In his view, consumers could react in an 
adverse way to any further signs of monetary ease.
