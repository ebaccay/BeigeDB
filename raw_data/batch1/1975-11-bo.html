      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors of the First District remain as unsettled as they were 
last month. They are not convinced that the recovery possesses 
either vitality or durability. The fundamentals appear to be lacking 
for recovery in New England. The unemployment rate for the region 
increased again in September to 12.6 percent. For Massachusetts and 
Connecticut, the September unemployment rates were 14 and 11.8 
percent, respectively.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Retailers report weaker October sales than they expected from their 
July and September experience. Consequently, they are stocking 
inventories rather conservatively, preferring to know with certainty 
that the sales volume is there before buying. Previously, the 
experiences of various retailers throughout the region varied 
widely, but our directors report that business has been much more 
uniform in recent months. One retailing director comments that 
suppliers have begun pricing more aggressively. He notes that a 
return to a more normal business volume will entail higher prices. 
The pressure is on to increase prices whenever the market can absorb 
them: otherwise profits suffer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The capital goods industry continues to live off order backlogs. 
Defense contractors in Connecticut, oil field equipment suppliers, 
and super alloy metal producers continue to report good business, 
but these areas remain the only bright spots. Tool and die 
manufacturers connected with the auto industry had hoped that even 
the modest improvements in Detroit's sales would have brought more 
activity than they have to date.
      </p>
      <p>
       Housing construction has improved almost in step with the gains 
nationally, but the collapse was so deep that the industry remains 
exceedingly weak. Landlords continue to convert apartments to 
condominiums, despite an overhang of housing in this market, in an 
attempt to sell property. The outlook for taxes and interest rates 
has tempered interest in leasing apartments.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent break in interest rates is a hopeful sign to all 
directors. Ironically, one banker notes that the prime rate cuts 
have further eroded bank profits, and therefore he is even less 
interested in municipals than before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most bankers report that loan demand has remained slack. There seems 
to be little customer interest in taking on new obligations, since 
business conditions have yet to show material improvement. 
Discussions between loan officers and borrowers indicate that it may 
be three to six months before cash demands will exhibit significant 
growth. One banker is using correspondent federal funds to buy 
treasuries instead of reselling the balances; so far, the bet on 
falling rates has been rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The employment picture is beginning to show some signs of 
improvement. Job openings and work orders are reappearing, but 
employers are being very selective. Individuals with very specific 
professional and technical expertise are in demand. Job 
opportunities for others remain sparse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The New York City problem has raised much interest among directors. 
They feel a constructive workout prior to default would save some 
anguish. According to observers here, the Administration has 
underestimated the wrangling, the chaos, and the cash drain a 
default would entail. The uncertainties are frightening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Professors Houthakker, Solow, Tobin, and Eckstein were available
for comment this month. All are less comfortable than they were a 
month before with recent economic developments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Houthakker is very unhappy with recent money growth. He favors 5 to 
6 percent money growth, but he feels that gyrations in the pattern 
of growth are harmful. He questions the value of using a short-term 
interest rate as an operating target to achieve monetary policy; 
changing money market outlooks end up influencing the money supply 
more than is desirable. He is also disappointed with third quarter 
investment; the seeds of a sustained recovery are absent. But he 
does feel that a flood of money would be inappropriate to stimulate 
investment. A New York default would not be a calamity, only an 
opportunity for reappraisal of state and local finances; however, 
the present bankruptcy law will inflict more hardship than 
necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solow questions the degree to which third quarter GNP strength is 
borrowed from later quarters. Although his assessments of 1976 have 
been raised a little, he is still very concerned about the recovery. 
The reduction in the federal funds rate is welcome, and a return to 
6 percent will not be warranted until the economy and the money 
stock have shown sustained growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobin notes that the Fed seems to be having trouble keeping money 
from falling. Aside from the inventory-fueled GNP growth, he finds 
no other indicator of economic strength especially striking. He is 
less optimistic than a month ago: for such a deep, prolonged 
recession, and for at least four months of recovery, we have very 
little to show; the recovery is not in the bag. Investment, state 
and local government spending, and, perhaps, federal spending are 
showing very little strength. Also, investors are discovering that 
borrowers do not necessarily pay lenders back. A shift in liquidity 
preference toward safe instruments may imply that the Fed needs to 
be even more aggressive in expanding the money stock just to 
maintain an unchanged policy position. The Fed should be ready to 
fulfill the lender of last resort function for the New York 
situation without causing the desk to offset bank borrowings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eckstein, too, is bothered by patterns of money growth. The 
stagnation of money since July indicates that interest rates have to 
be kept moderate with easing credit conditions until the money 
supply confirms the continuity of the recovery. He, too, is worried 
about the increasing risk premia in interest rates. New York cannot 
help but tighten bank loan policy and increase the investor 
preference for treasuries and liquidity. New York City is already 
tightening the credit market despite reductions in the funds rate-risk premia have increased-and is threatening the Baa rating or 
municipal borrowers' abilities to obtain funds. A full default would 
undoubtedly increase these risk premia even further for a time.
