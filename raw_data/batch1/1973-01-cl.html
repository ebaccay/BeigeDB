      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 10, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>

      <p>
       Economic activity in the District ended the year on a strong upward 
trend. Retail sales surpassed expectations. Manufacturers have been 
experiencing increased inventory building on the part of customers. 
Payroll employment continues to expand at a more rapid rate in the 
District than in the nation, and residential building remains at a 
high level. There are, however, some indications of constraints on 
production stemming from physical capacity limitations, fuel and 
labor shortages, and difficulty in obtaining supplies. Bankers 
report strong deposit flows at the year-end.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales over the holiday period are reported to have been very 
strong. The improvement in the Cleveland area was much better than 
anticipated by retail merchants. They were particularly surprised by 
the surge in shopping between Christmas and New Year's Day, and by 
the continued boom in sales during the first week of January. The 
Pittsburgh area also had an excellent volume of retail trade over 
the holidays. According to one bank economist, Pittsburgh's economy 
came back from the recession only in the fourth quarter of 1972. The 
area's steel industry is finally showing year-to-year gains in 
employment, while other durable goods industries that had been 
sluggish since 1970 are beginning to demonstrate signs of increased 
activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel industry economists report strong order demand, with recovery 
in those product lines that had been relatively weak. Steel users 
are beginning to accumulate inventories more aggressively. One steel 
company is becoming concerned about their ability to ship all of the 
orders currently scheduled for March delivery. They are approaching 
capacity limits on some products in certain plants. One of our 
directors reported that another large steel company in his area is 
operating at full capacity. A third steel company mentioned a surge 
of inventory accumulation by their customers, stemming partly from 
attempts to beat price increases, partly from a greater willingness 
of users to hold larger inventories to ensure continuity of 
production, and partly because the cash positions of their customers 
has improved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of our industrial directors mentioned that the fourth 
quarter was outstanding for their businesses, particularly in the 
areas of office equipment and motor vehicle equipment. Delivery 
times are stretching out, and there are reports of difficulty in 
hiring skilled employees and in one instance high quality unskilled 
workers. One of our directors, a university president, commented 
that for the first time in years the employment situation is much 
better for their graduates, based on the increased number of 
recruiters and job offers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Machine tool companies in the area are expecting a boom in new 
orders. Some are having difficulty in getting supplies that could 
have been purchased off the shelf a few months ago. Others are 
having difficulty in obtaining skilled labor. An economist from a 
large machine tool firm in Cleveland said they are deliberately 
stretching out backlogs rather than attempting to increase output by 
hiring more workers (which they are not sure of finding even if they 
tried). The firm is running down its inventory of cutting tools 
built during the previous slack period, and their customers have 
begun to accumulate inventories in earnest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economists from several major oil companies headquartered in the 
District report bottlenecks in physical plant, with operations 
running over 100 percent capacity. Even though fuel oil is in short 
supply, oil refineries are tending to concentrate on producing 
gasoline, which (because of price ceilings) is more profitable than 
fuel oil. One economist expects a shortage of transportation fuels 
by spring. The oil companies are having difficulty in satisfying the 
demands of their regular customers, and they are reluctant to take 
on new customers. In some instances, fuel shortages have constrained 
manufacturing output in the District. In recent weeks, some plants 
have had to shut down and others have had to reduce operations 
because their supplies of natural gas were curtailed and they could 
not obtain alternative fuel sources such as crude oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers report a strong flow of deposits at the year-end, reflecting 
the rapid pace of business activity. Mortgage loan demand continues 
to be strong, while the volume of residential construction contracts 
in the District (as of November) was only a shade below the record 
high reached last May. Business loan demand has shown signs of 
further strength in recent weeks.
