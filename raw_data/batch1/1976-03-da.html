      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Industrial output in the Eleventh District continues to expand. 
Chemical production and petroleum refining, two of the largest 
industries in the District, continue to pace the recovery which 
began last spring. However, production of oil-field equipment, which 
has been a mainstay of the District economy, faces the prospects of 
falling in coming months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chemical manufacturers report that three major
        <br/>
        markets—
construction-related products, textiles, and automobiles—have 
firmed. As a result, they are optimistic that the recovery in 
chemical production, initially in response to the rebuilding of 
inventories by users, will continue. In addition, producers are 
maintaining a constant inventory-sales ratio and are building 
inventories of finished goods with the increase in sales. The severe 
drought in the southwestern and Midwestern states, however, has 
raised the threat that output by the District's agricultural 
chemicals manufacturers will fall. Sharply reduced spring planting 
intentions, particularly by dry-land farmers, are expected to result 
in production cutbacks in agricultural chemicals in the summer and 
early fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Petroleum refining, part of whose output is processed by the 
chemical industry, is also expanding. Since last spring, capacity 
utilization at refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast has risen from 88 
percent to 94 percent. Petroleum refineries have also stepped up 
operations to meet increased demand for gasoline.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers of oil-field equipment are still operating near the 
peak levels of 1975, but a slowdown in worldwide drilling activity 
has begun to affect the demand for equipment. According to two 
thirds of the leading manufacturers surveyed, the backlog of 
unfilled orders is dwindling as the inflow of new orders has slowed, 
and there has been a substantial rise in order cancellations. One of 
the District's biggest producers of oil-field equipment said that, 
unless new orders pick up, they will begin laying off workers by 
midyear.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outlook for industrial prices varies widely according to the 
industry. Prices of agricultural chemicals are expected to remain 
stable through 1976. Firms producing industrial chemicals, however, 
have recently announced price hikes for basic and intermediate 
products. But there is some doubts that these increases will hold. 
According to one insider, discounts are still commonplace. Several 
of the largest producers of structural steel, on the other hand, 
claim they will no longer sell below list prices. Aggressive price 
cutting last year in that industry resulted in many sales being bid 
below production costs. Apparel manufacturers say significant price 
hikes at the retail level are inevitable, since costs are climbing 
rapidly. And, according to one of the District's largest garment 
makers, there is virtually no profit margin at current price levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The largest department stores in the District report that sales 
continue at a brisk pace and the strength is broadbased. Roughly 
half of the merchants surveyed said inventories have now been 
brought in line with the increased level of sales, but others 
complained of shortages and slow deliveries. An El Paso merchant, 
for example, said that in the past six months he has received only 
75 to 80 percent of the goods he had ordered. And a large chain in 
the southwest said that they have already been warned by the textile 
mills of a substantial shortage of wool goods for next fall and 
winter. Cash sales are still abnormally high, although credit-card 
purchases are beginning to rise.
       </p>
       <p>
        New car sales in early 1976 remain strong, but the composition of 
sales has changed markedly. Small cars are moving very slowly, while 
there is a strong resurgence in sales of large models. Moreover, 
most big cars are sold loaded with extras. Dealers attribute the 
turnaround in big cars to the increased availability of gasoline and 
lower pump prices. The consensus of dealers contacted is that 
customers will continue to buy large models, nearly irrespective of 
price, as long as gasoline is not in short supply. The resurgence in 
big-car sales has left dealers with large inventories of small cars, 
while large models are in critically short supply.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wheat crop in the high plains of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma 
has been severely damaged by drought conditions. Bankers estimate 
that wheat production in the plains will drop at least 40 percent 
below the level in 1975. The three-state area accounts for a fourth 
of the nation's wheat crop, and most of the states production is in 
the high plains.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of the nonirrigated wheat has already been lost. Wind erosion 
has damaged fields, and farmers have chiseled their wheat land to 
try to control the damage. Bankers report many growers are planning 
just to control weeds and to prepare their land for next year's 
crop. However, some farmers will plant sorghum on acreage that was 
seeded to wheat, provided sufficient rainfall occurs in March and 
April.
       </p>
       <p>
        The irrigated wheat crop could still benefit from good rains in the 
next few weeks. And, for these growers, a good yield is especially 
critical because of the extremely high production costs entailed in 
this year's crop. Extensive irrigation has been required, and 
soaring fuel prices have substantially raised the costs of running 
pumps. Preplant irrigation for spring crops is also expected to be 
well above normal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the drought, winter grazing of wheat in the high plains 
is virtually nonexistent. A west Texas banker estimates that the 
number of cattle on wheat pasture is 80 to 90 percent below a year 
earlier. Most of the grazing is confined to a few irrigated fields.
