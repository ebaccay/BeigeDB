      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 14, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Reports from our directors and other business executives indicate a 
mixed picture of strengths and weaknesses. Inflation remains the 
main concern of many of our directors, and their reports indicated 
that prices will remain under upward pressure over the period ahead. 
There is little firm evidence as yet that the pace of economic 
activity in the District is slowing down significantly, although 
there are some limited indications of softening in capital spending 
plans among utilities. Supply conditions generally have eased, and 
this development coupled with higher interest cost is leading to a 
reappraisal of inventory situations. Demand for steel products 
remains intense. Industrial firms and utilities are trying 
desperately to stockpile coal. Conditions in the District's savings 
and loan industry continue to tighten.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early returns from our monthly survey of manufacturers showed some 
weakening in new orders during July, following three consecutive 
months of recovery. Firms reported further moderate gains in 
shipments and inventories. Backlogs are still rising, and price 
increases remain pervasive.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of our directors associated with a major retail firm emphasized 
that the physical volume of sales remains basically level. In 
addition, he was particularly pessimistic about the price outlook 
for the near term, noting that most of the foods in the retail 
pipeline carried considerably higher prices than goods currently on 
the shelf. Several other directors also gave pessimistic reports 
about the likely price structure for their products in the months 
ahead. A director, associated with a consumer products firm, noted 
specifically that the firm's price increases reflect only higher 
costs for raw materials and that the firm was absorbing other cost 
increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       The supply situation for raw materials generally has eased in the 
past few months, although there are still numerous reports of 
shortages. Buying lead times for production materials have improved 
slightly since the end of price controls. Two of our directors-one 
with a large industrial firm and the other with a consumer goods 
producer-noted that increased availability of basic materials and 
high interest costs are causing a significant reassessment of 
inventory positions. Another director mentioned that lift trucks are 
being delivered faster and that paper companies in Ohio are now 
giving quick delivery. A chemical firm reported that certain 
petrochemical products remain in short supply, while a chemical-rubber firm stated that petroleum derivatives are now in ample 
supply. The same company reported its tire inventories are on the 
high side, but that it does not plan to cut production. Management 
is relying on a pickup in new car sales, especially fleet purchases, 
to reduce its inventories. An executive in the machinery industry 
remarked that some of their inventories are growing faster than 
desired because shortages of component parts have held up shipments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Industrial firms and electric utilities in the District, which 
depend on coal more heavily than the national average, are 
increasingly concerned over the possibility of a miners' strike in 
November. Many firms are attempting to stockpile coal. The steel 
industry has only a two to three-week inventory of coal. The steel 
industry would have to start cutting back production immediately to 
protect its facilities in the event of a strike.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel demand remains strong as customers continue to stockpile steel 
products. An economist with a major steel firm said that the market 
situation could turn around fast if customers stop hoarding. 
Railroad wheels, rails, and plates are in particularly short supply. 
Companies are paying a premium of $100 a ton over domestic prices 
for imported steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending plans appear to be holding up, although there are 
some signs of softening. Purchasing agents in the Cleveland area 
continue to maintain long lead times for capital equipment. 
Economists with petrochemical, machinery, and steel companies say 
their spending plans for the remainder of this year have not been 
scaled down, despite the high cost of borrowing and a squeeze on 
cash flow in some firms. Steel mills are increasing their capacity 
for making hot steel and semifinished products. where the production 
bottlenecks are concentrated. Nonresidential building awards in the 
District remain strong, but there are indications of a softening in 
new orders for machine tools and some other types of industrial 
machinery. A director in the machine tool business believes his 
orders backlog is about to level off and then remain on a high 
plateau for about a year. Other directors expressed the opinion that 
industrial firms must be reexamining their capital spending plans. 
Several utilities in the District recently announced cutbacks in 
planned capital spending programs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's savings and loan associations lost deposits 
throughout the month of July and during the first week of August. An 
official with a Federal Home Loan Bank described the situation as 
poor, but not exactly a disaster. Recent deposit outflows were 
greater in Cleveland and Cincinnati, and were related to the 
Treasury note offerings. Savings and loan associations are still 
making mortgage loans; all are at rates of 9 percent or higher-some 
are charging 10 percent.
