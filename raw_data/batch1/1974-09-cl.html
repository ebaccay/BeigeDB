       September 5, 1974

       Reports from economists, directors, and other businessmen suggest 
limited improvement in nonautomotive retail trade and a recent 
stimulus to new car sales. There are scattered signs of price 
declines among some industrial commodities and increased 
availability of raw materials. Demand for steel remains strong, 
partly because steel users are hedging against a coal strike. Coal 
business is booming, while output is being hampered by shortages. A 
number of electric utilities are shifting their capital spending 
from atomic power plants to coal and oil plants. S&amp;Ls in the 
District continue to lose deposits in August.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales of a major department store chain in the northeast Ohio 
area have improved recently, following a virtually flat to declining 
level of sales for several months. The president of that chain 
attributes the recent spurt to extensive sales promotions. Their 
inventories, which have been more than ample in recent months, are 
being brought into better balance. He expects that remaining excess 
stocks could be worked off over the next few months if the recent 
pickup were sustained. However, he felt that the unit sales would do 
well to hold even, at least in the near term.
      </p>
      <p>
       An economist with another major retail chain reported that the 
physical volume of sales remains flat. Their inventories, which were 
considered excessive two months ago, have increased. The firm 
expects a decline in unit sales of one to two percent during the 
balance of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Auto dealers in the Cleveland area are experiencing an increase in 
sales of 1974 models as a result of the recently publicized price 
increases on 1975 models. Supplies of full-sized and intermediate 
models have been drawn down, but stocks of small cars are said to be 
abundant. Dealer sentiment is that the typical new car buyer will be 
reluctant to purchase a 1975 model, primarily because of the price 
factor, but also because of uncertainties concerning the 
availability of unleaded fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
       An economist for a major tire producer reported that recent declines 
in prices for natural rubber, cotton, and propane lead him to 
conclude that industrial price pressures will moderate, albeit 
gradually. According to this source, capital spending plans of his 
firm have not been scaled downward because of the cost or 
availability of borrowed capital. Inventory plans have not been 
deterred by interest rates and their inventories are now being held 
in check as a result of a more abundant supply of raw materials and 
declines in some commodity prices. Their short-term debt has 
"soared" in part reflecting financing of inventories, and they have 
relied heavily on commercial paper to satisfy working capital needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sources in the steel industry say they are having difficulty in 
maintaining production due to shortages of raw materials and 
downtime for maintenance. Steel mills are also experiencing a 
critical shortage of freight cars. New orders for steel products 
have been highly erratic, and almost meaningless, because order 
books are filled so fast each time a new quarter is opened. One 
major firm mentioned that its order intake was dropping sharply and 
should be reflected in national figures. The drop in orders stems 
from an effort by the firm to return to more realistic delivery 
schedules, rather than any weakening in demand. Steel shipments are 
expected to decline about 10 percent in the second half; as a 
result, there may be some involuntary liquidation of inventories by 
steel users. The first real test of steel inventories, according to 
one economist, will come after the coal settlement. If there is a 
coal strike, severe cutbacks in steel output are expected within a 
week. One major steel firm has only a few days supply of low 
volatile coal needed to operate their coke ovens.
      </p>
      <p>
       An economist with a large coal company commented "it would be 
prudent to factor in a two to three-week miners' strike in any 
economic forecast." Expansion of capacity and output in the coal 
industry is being hampered by environmental factors, long lead times 
on machinery, and shortages of construction crews, drilling 
equipment, and railroad cars.
      </p>
      <p>
       A director who is a supplier to a major electrical equipment company 
said the firm has a nine-year backlog of turbines and generators. 
The firm does not plan to expand capacity, however, because they 
fear that the orders may be canceled. The same director noted that 
many businessmen are expecting wage-price controls and therefore are 
retrenching on their capital spending. Another director with a 
utility expressed deep concern that "utilities are in a liquidity 
crisis, which may provoke an energy crisis." According to this 
director, electric utilities are canceling atomic plants because of 
their high capital costs, and substituting less capital intensive 
coal and oil plants. The irony is that atomic plants have fixed fuel 
costs, while coal and oil plants have rising fuel costs—so the 
shift away from atomic plants is inflationary in the long run. A 
second director confirmed this, noting that both atomic and fossil 
plants have been canceled because of the high cost of financing and 
load demand running below expectations. A number of these facilities 
were slated for completion after 1980. In addition, because of 
rising construction costs, there is a rush to complete those plants 
currently under construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Federal Home Loan Bank official reported that, on the basis of the 
preliminary sample of 35 reporting associations, savings flows in 
August deteriorated further, especially in the second ten days of 
the month. He remarked, however, that the situation does not appear 
to be as bad as August 1973 when wild card certificates were 
introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some bank economists in the Cleveland area described their net 
deposits in August as exceeding the year ago volume, despite some 
runoff at the time of the Treasury note offering. One expressed 
concern that the Fed might well be overstaying restraint and that 
continued restraint will result in a recession. Another stated that 
although there is danger that the Fed will be restrictive too long 
he did not feel that the tine had come for a change in policy. Both 
of these economists expressed concern that Merrill Lynch's offering 
will cause another runoff on savings deposits and hinder their 
ability to issue CDs since that firm advertises that the CDs are 
insured by the FDIC.
