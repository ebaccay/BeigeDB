       Supply shortages appear to be constraining output in the district. 
Retail sales are leveling off. Reports from purchasing agents and 
the machine tool industry indicate that capital spending will be 
strong next year. S&amp;Ls continue to experience deposit outflows, and 
housing is declining. Business loan demand is still strong, and 
commercial banks have sharply reduced rates on large CDs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several of our directors along with economists and financial 
officers representing steel, machine tools, chemicals, and ceramic 
industries regard supply constraints as the main source of the 
recent moderation in economic activity, especially within their own 
industries. Two of our industrial directors, who have been 
indicating that shortages were hampering production, noted that the 
problem has become more severe in recent weeks. One director 
reported that his firm has shut down numerous glass production lines 
as a result of a severe shortage of soda ash. Suppliers of this 
critical material for the glass industry are apparently telling 
customers that the supply will not increase until new production 
facilities are put in place, which could be a year or longer. A 
second director reported that supply limitations in a broad range of 
plastic materials have caused a cutback in production. He noted that 
the firm is importing some of its raw materials, but at prices 
considerably above those paid to domestic suppliers. He also 
reported that supply problems have caused the firm to reexamine its 
capital spending plans for 1974, but at present, they are going 
ahead. with an important expansion of production facilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel industry economists say the industry is still rationing steel. 
The order books for most steel products are full and have been 
closed for the balance of the year according to one large steel 
producer. Another major firm is not yet accepting orders for 1974 
delivery, although it is assuring customers they will get their 
share of steel next year. The tight domestic supply situation is 
forcing steel consumers to purchase foreign steel at premium prices. 
Consequently, steel imports are not declining as much as the 
industry had expected earlier this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing agents in the Cleveland area report that shortages of 
parts and materials have held down output during September. The 
Canadian newsprint and rail strikes adversely affected some 
manufacturing operations in the area. Buyers are complaining about 
failures of vendors to maintain delivery schedules. With the list of 
shortages, one of the longest in the past two decades, firms are 
experiencing difficulties in building inventories. According to the 
purchasing agents, the forward commitment position for capital 
expenditures is the longest it has been in years. In recent months, 
almost half the firms surveyed have reported buying lead times of 
one year or more for capital goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president of a major department store in Cleveland and the 
economist with a large retail chain in the district both report a 
progressive slowing in their sales since last spring. Furniture 
sales, in particular, have not regained previous highs of late 
spring. Trade sources expressed the view that retail sales are 
softening because of inflation, especially in food and gasoline, as 
well as consumers' fears of poorer business conditions in prospect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Machine tool firms in the area are still inundated with new orders. 
With the workweek at the limit, firms are taking on more workers as 
they become available. One large machine tool firm in Cleveland 
reports the attrition rate is very high because things are so good. 
They may hire 20 workers and net ten after a month. Even though the 
peak in new orders appears to have been passed, the order backlog in 
machine tools is high enough to sustain full-capacity operations 
well into 1974 according to one economist.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is considerable concern among firms in the area that energy 
shortages could hamper production during the winter. Representatives 
from a large steel and large chemical firm report they are 
stockpiling fuel in the event of shortages in the coming months.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Federal Home Loan Bank economist says that S&amp;Ls in this district 
very likely experienced further deposit losses in September. Most 
S&amp;Ls in large metropolitan areas have issued wildcard certificates, 
but purchases of these CDs largely represented transfers from 
existing savings accounts rather than new money. S&amp;Ls in the area 
generally are fulfilling past mortgage commitments, but only a few 
are making new ones. District residential construction contracts are 
declining; the dollar volume in August was down considerably from 
the peak in January.
      </p>
      <p>
       In recent weeks, business loans by major banks in Cleveland rose 
sharply, partly because of a tax settlement date. One of the largest 
banks reported its business loans were nearly as large as its peak 
volume in May. The banks also reported that mortgage loans were at a 
high for the month of September. Major banks in the district cut 
their rates on large CDs dramatically in the past three weeks. Rates 
on all maturities are now lower than at the beginning of August, 
with the largest declines (as much as 225 basis points) in the 
  
  longer-term maturities. Some of the smaller banks that offered 
wildcard certificates with guaranteed rates between 8 percent and 9 
percent have reached their limits. Some of the larger banks, which 
were issuing certificates at around 7 percent, have not been 
soliciting funds in recent weeks as actively as they were in August.
