      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic activity in the Third District is still expanding. Retail 
  sales have picked up after a period of softness, and conditions in 
  manufacturing have improved, although the pace of expansion in this 
  sector is slower than last month. Employment in manufacturing is up 
  for the fourth month in a row, while new orders and shipments are 
  down fractionally. At the same time, inventories are basically 
  unchanged from June. For the longer term, both retailers and 
  manufacturers are optimistic. Businessmen indicate that prices 
  continue to rise but no dramatic movements are evident. South Jersey 
  shore resorts report a good season so far and are bullish about the 
  rest of the summer. Bankers indicate that business loan demand is 
  still soft but are not yet ready to make price concessions to 
  generate additional volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers responding to this month's business outlook survey 
  report that business is better although the improvement is less 
  widespread than in June. Close to one-third of the executives 
  surveyed indicate improvement in overall business conditions 
  compared with two-fifths reporting gains last month. New orders and 
  shipments are down fractionally, and inventories, which declined a 
  bit last month, are reported to be essentially unchanged from that 
  time. On the "plus" side, employment in manufacturing continues to 
  improve. The factory workweek is marginally longer this month, and 
  increases in work forces are reported by 19 percent of the firms 
  polled. This is the fourth month in a row in which job gains have 
  been recorded.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite the current weakness in a few indicators, the outlook in 
  manufacturing for the next two quarters is optimistic. Of the 
  businessmen polled, 3 out of 4 project a higher level of economic 
  activity by the beginning of 1977. Specific gains are anticipated in 
  new orders, shipments, and employment while inventories are expected 
  to grow only slightly from present levels. Increases are planned in 
  spending for plant and equipment by one-third of those surveyed—about the same proportion of respondents as last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the price scene, manufacturers report paying and receiving higher 
  prices this month. Better than half of the executives in the current 
  survey report paying more for their inputs, and 1 out of 5 indicates 
  higher prices for outputs. Over the next half year, 86 percent 
  expect to be paying more for their supplies and nearly as many 
  anticipate higher prices for their finished products. In the 
  meantime, retailers report a gradual upward trend in prices with 
  movements characterized as "evolutionary rather than revolutionary."
     </p>
     <p>
      Area retailers report that sales have picked up after a brief period 
  of softness. Sales gains are put at 10 percent above year-ago 
  levels. Durable goods are reported to be selling well while soft 
  goods are "holding their own." Major appliances, auto accessories, 
  and sporting goods are mentioned as strong sellers. One merchant 
  indicates a good selldown of seasonal items, but another notes 
  excess stocks of seasonal soft goods, especially sportswear. Despite 
  the recent period of weakness, retailers remain optimistic for the 
  rest of this year. As one merchant puts it, "We see no reason to 
  overhaul our optimistic forecast for the second half since the basic 
  factors promoting strong consumer spending are still present." In 
  addition, there are no reported changes in any buying or ordering 
  plans. According to one retailer, "We expect strong demand down the 
  road, so we don't want to overreact to a temporary lull in sales 
  thereby ending up with shortages a few months out."
     </p>
     <p>
      Contacts at South Jersey shore resorts report that the early part of 
  the summer has been as good as, or better than, the same period last 
  year. Bicentennial visitors, especially to Philadelphia, were 
  expected to spill over to the shore areas and provide an added boost 
  to business, but contacts indicate that this has not yet happened to 
  any significant degree.
     </p>
     <p>
      The prospects for the rest of this reason are favorable. Inquiries 
  from potential vacationers are reported to be up from last year, and 
  advance bookings for August are reported to be high. For the season 
  as a whole, shore officials feel that with good summer weather 
  business activity will exceed the relatively strong performances of 
  last year. On top of this, any additional business from Bicentennial 
  visitors will be, in one contact's words, "just icing on the cake."
     </p>
     <p>
      Area bankers continue to report that loan volume is flat. Auto and 
  credit card loans are moving upward at some banks, but business 
  loans are labeled "basically unchanged" by the majority of bankers 
  contacted. Most bankers indicate that current loan volume is below 
  their forecasts made last fall. For example, one executive at a $3 
  billion bank notes that loans at his bank are running $200 million 
  below the expected level. Despite this weakness, there are no 
  reports on price concessions on business loan terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the longer term, bankers continue to feel that loan volume will 
  pick up gradually in the third quarter and gather momentum in the 
  fourth. However, one banker feels that for most of the second half 
  of 1976 the softness in business loans will continue since prime 
  borrowers can bypass banks by selling their own notes on favorable 
  terms. Another contact feels that banks may step up their efforts if 
  loan demand doesn't improve. "For now, we'd rather sweat it out than 
  get locked into some unprofitable situations by making price 
  concessions. We take this position because we feel that demand will 
  materialize. If it doesn't, however, we'll see much more aggressive 
  action on the part of the banks in the second half of the year to 
  boost loan volume."
