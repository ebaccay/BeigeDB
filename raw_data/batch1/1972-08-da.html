      Beige Book Report: Dallas

      <strong>
       August 9, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The economy of the Eleventh District continued to show strength in 
June, although indicators were generally mixed. Texas industrial 
production continued to rise, and retail sales and automobile 
registrations grew substantially. Construction activity in the five-state region eased slightly in spite of a sharp increase in Texas. 
While the unemployment rate for the five states continued to edge 
downward, the level of employment also declined.
      </p>
      <p>
       The seasonally adjusted Texas Industrial Production Index continued 
to rise in June, pushing the index to a level nearly 10 percent 
higher than it was in December 1971. All three sectors of industrial 
production-manufacturing, mining, and utilities-contributed to the 
June advance, but mining provided the main impetus, as production of 
crude oil rose sharply. In manufacturing, output of durable goods 
increased moderately over the previous month, with the largest 
advances occurring in transportation equipment and stone, clay, and 
glass products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two related industries-primary metals and fabricated metal products-
showed declines in June but were still ahead of their outputs a year 
before, as were all manufacturing industries. Manufacturing of 
nondurable goods also rose only moderately in June, in spite of 
substantial gains in two industries-textiles and paper and allied 
products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seasonally adjusted total employment in the five southwestern states 
fell slightly in June. As a result of a sharp decline in the number 
of people looking for jobs, however, the unemployment rate continued 
its gradual decline started last October, falling to 4.3 percent of 
the labor force in these states, compared with 4.7 percent in June 
1971. Employment fell below month-earlier levels in most categories 
of both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing. Finance was the only 
major reporting industry group to show a rise in employment. All 
other industries showed declines, the largest being in construction, 
transportation, and public utilities. In spite of the June drop, 
however, all industries continued to show year-to-year gains with 
the exception of mining, which was down slightly from June 1971.
      </p>
      <p>
       Registration of new passenger automobiles in Dallas, Fort Worth, 
Houston, and San Antonio rose substantially in June. Total 
registrations were 11 percent higher than in June 1971. Cumulative 
registrations through the first six months of the year were 12 
percent higher than in the corresponding period last year. All four 
metropolitan centers showed substantial increases in cumulative 
registrations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store sales in the Eleventh District increased 
substantially in the four weeks ended July 22 over the corresponding 
period last year. Cumulative sales through that date were also much 
higher than in the corresponding period a year before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total construction activity for the five southwestern states fell 
slightly in June after two months of record-breaking activity. A 
sharp decline in nonbuilding construction accounted for most of the 
June drop, as well as for the sharp rise in April and May. 
Residential building continued to play a major role as it increased 
in June for the fourth consecutive month. Nonresidential building 
declined slightly. The cumulative value of contracts awarded in the 
five-state area for the first six months was 37.1 percent higher 
than in the comparable period in 1971. Texas's construction 
increased its already dominant role among the five southwestern 
states, as it rose in June to a level over 38 percent higher than in 
June of last year. Both residential and nonresidential building in 
Texas rebounded sharply in June after declining in May.
      </p>
      <p>
       The winter wheat crop in states of the Eleventh District is expected 
to be nearly a third higher this year than in the below average 1971 
season. The projection, revised upward July 1, is based on yields 
that appear better than previously expected. Texas feedlots had a 
record 2.1 million head of cattle on feed at midyear-a fourth more 
than a year before. Higher prices for meat animals boosted the index 
of prices received by Texas farmers and ranchers in the month ended 
June 15, to a level 18 percent higher than a year earlier. The index 
of prices paid by U.S. farmers moved up slightly from a month 
earlier to a level 5 percent higher than a year before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although District oil allowables continue to permit maximum 
production, U.S. crude supplies are apparently in tight supply, 
causing Gulf area imports to surge. A special supplemental quota is 
now in effect for the second half of the year. Drilling in the 
District states is showing continuing strength and should be 
bolstered still further by lease sales of the Louisiana coast 
scheduled for December. The industry is, however, suspicious of tax 
reform that could significantly reduce incentives for exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Total credit at weekly reporting banks in the Eleventh District 
declined slightly in the five weeks ended July 26, as a rapid 
expansion in loans was more than offset by an even sharper decline 
in bank holdings of government and municipal securities. Total 
deposits increased moderately, and banks reduced their net purchases 
of Federal funds. An abnormal rise in business loans paced the 
growth in total loans and probably reflected further improvements in 
District economic activity. Consumer loans D, the highly volatile 
loans to nonbank financial institutions also registered unusual 
strength. The expansions in total deposits resulted from larger 
inflows of both demand and time and savings deposits. The volume of 
large-denomination CD's outstanding rose moderately, and bank 
borrowing from nondeposit sources was virtually unchanged.
