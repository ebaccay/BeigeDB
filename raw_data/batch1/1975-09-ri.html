      Beige Book Report: Richmond

      <strong>
       September 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The September Survey of Fifth District Business Conditions reveals 
continued improvement across a broad range of economic activity. 
Responses indicate sizable increases in manufacturing shipments and 
new orders along with greater backlogs of orders and further 
reductions of inventories, particularly of raw materials. 
Inventories of finished goods apparently declined only slightly 
during August. Over 40 percent of manufacturing respondents still 
view current inventory levels as excessive. Employment seems to have 
increased slightly in the manufacturing sector while hours worked 
per week increased for the fourth consecutive month. Among retailers 
participating in our Survey, sales were generally up for the month, 
and sales of big ticket items relative to total sales remained 
unchanged. Prices apparently rose across a wide range as substantial 
numbers of manufacturers and retailers reported paying and receiving 
higher prices. In the banking sector, commercial and industrial 
loans outstanding at Weekly Reporting Banks have declined over the 
past several weeks while consumer loans continued to post modest but 
steady gains. Both demand and time deposits have shown weakness 
during August.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Among manufacturers responding to the September Survey, one-half 
reported increases in shipments and in the volume of new orders 
during August. In addition, those reporting increases in backlogs of 
orders outnumbered those reporting decreases by two to one. In each 
of these areas, the improvement was more broadly based than at any 
time in recent months. These improvements in the level of business 
activity seem to be most pronounced in the basic industries and in 
consumer related areas. Textile mills, apparel and related products, 
and furniture and fixtures accounted for a sizable portion of the 
improvement along with primary metals and chemicals. Judging from 
the Survey, those industries which seem to be lagging are in the 
machinery and equipment, and electrical equipment areas, although 
the food industry also reports little change. Inventories of 
materials held by manufacturers declined further during August while 
stocks of finished goods showed little change. As in August, over 40 
percent of the manufacturers feel current inventory levels are 
excessive. But almost all of those surveyed are satisfied with 
current expansion plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prices seem to have taken a turn for the worse during August, as 
over half of the manufacturers responding to our Survey report 
paying, and over one-third report receiving, higher prices. The 
Survey of Retailers yielded much the same results concerning prices. 
The indicated price movement may have contributed to the minor 
deterioration of the outlook for the next six months. While our 
Survey respondents remain basically optimistic, that feeling seems 
to have weakened slightly in the past month, despite the fact that 
recent optimistic expectations have been largely borne out by 
business developments. One manufacturer surveyed specifically noted 
his expectation that the level of business activity will improve 
during September and October and then fall off for the remainder of 
the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other results from our Survey of District Retailers also support the 
view that business activity is continuing to improve. Over one-half 
of the retailers surveyed reported increased sales during August. 
During that period, sales of big ticket items relative to total 
sales remained unchanged. In view of the improved level of total 
sales, the situation in big ticket items may be significant. Judging 
from our monthly surveys, sales of big ticket items have been 
declining, in both absolute and relative terms, for the past year. 
If the relative decline has abated and total sales are, in fact, 
beginning to increase, the general recovery may be due for a 
substantial new impetus from the durable goods sector.
      </p>
      <p>
       Inventories at the retail level declined slightly during the month 
and most Survey respondents view current levels as about right. 
There is also general satisfaction, among the retailers surveyed, 
with the number and size of outlets presently operating. Retailers 
also remain basically optimistic with regard to the outlook over the 
next six months, expecting improvement nationally, locally, and 
within their own firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a widespread expectation among Fifth District bankers that 
business loan demand will increase, at least moderately, by the end 
of the year. Nevertheless, commercial and industrial loans 
outstanding at Weekly Reporting Banks over the past several weeks 
have declined from the level reached after a surge in demand during 
July. There has been no easing in the firm credit standards that 
have become common at District banks. Consumer loans continue to 
post modest but steady gains, and it appears that some banks are 
becoming more interested in these types of loans. In fact, District 
banks seem more receptive to making most types of loans, with the 
exception of multifamily mortgage loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both demand and time deposits have shown some weakness during 
August, and savings deposits at Weekly Reporting Banks declined for 
the first time this year. CD holdings have remained rather steady, 
while average net Federal funds purchases and discount window 
borrowings have increased to offset liability declines in other 
areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's cash receipts from farm marketings during the first 
half of the year were 2 percent under the same period last year. The 
District decline is much less than that for the nation, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Better quality marketings and improved grade prices have combined to
bring about an upward trend in the general average price for flue-cured tobacco over the past several weeks. Flue-cured prices for the 
season through September 5 averaged 7 percent below a year earlier, 
however. With gross sales also down (probably because many farmers 
are holding their tobacco off the market in hopes of further 
improvement in prices), value of sales is 14 percent under a year 
ago.
