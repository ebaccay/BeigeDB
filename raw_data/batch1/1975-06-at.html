      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 11, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic news is spotty this month. Unemployment seems to have 
  stabilized, and a number of district industries appear to be growing 
  increasingly optimistic. Car sales have improved slightly, and new 
  truck sales are reported as strong. One Atlanta bank indicates that 
  credit card losses are running four to five times above normal 
  levels. Crop plantings in the district have progressed rapidly 
  during recent favorable weather conditions. While residential 
  construction continues at low levels, announcements of commercial 
  and industrial projects remain brisk.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from Louisiana and Florida suggest the rise in unemployment 
  has halted. In Florida, the northern part of the state around 
  Jacksonville and the Panhandle apparently is already improving, and 
  central Florida is starting to show a pickup; but south Florida 
  around the Miami area remains depressed. Public works jobs along 
  with high levels of car imports at the Jacksonville port seem to be 
  adding strength to Jacksonville's economy. Activity at the port in 
  Mobile, Alabama, also is at a high level. A central Florida director 
  indicates that several local businesses are now placing orders to 
  build up inventories. Directors in southern Alabama and Mississippi 
  report an improving job outlook, with new hiring expected in the 
  shipbuilding, pulp and paper, furniture, and chemical industries. 
  They report that skilled job positions are still going unfilled in 
  many job categories. Several businessmen in Georgia's textile and 
  carpet industries report business improving and some rehiring. A 
  Georgia apparel manufacturer notes a sudden increase in new orders, 
  indicating an improvement in business conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      All the news isn't good, however. U.S. Steel shut down its Ensley 
  mill near Birmingham, Alabama, to meet the May 31 air pollution 
  abatement deadline; the closing will cost 2,000 jobs and result in a 
  $60 million annual loss to the area's economy. Honeywell Aerospace, 
  in St. Petersburg, Florida, will lay off over 100 workers after 
  failing to win a government contract. Several Georgia paper 
  manufacturers have recently scaled back their labor forces because 
  of a drop in demand for paper products.
     </p>
     <p>
      Automobile manufacturers' representatives in various areas report 
  that dealers have benefited greatly from reduced borrowing costs and 
  from the sales increases of the past few months. However, there has 
  as yet been no noticeable impact on car sales from the tax rebates. 
  Also, no noticeable shift in car size preference has taken place. 
  Representatives indicate that orders from dealers are strong and 
  that dealers are now much more optimistic. Truck sales are reported 
  as very strong now, possibly because of the investment tax credit. 
  One Florida director notes that auto dealers are now looking for new 
  salesmen. Used car sales are reported as exceptionally strong in his 
  area.
     </p>
     <p>
      An Atlanta bank reports that its bank credit card losses are running 
  about five times above normal. It is also getting hit very hard this 
  year with defaults on small consumer loans. As a result, it is 
  reevaluating its consumer lending practices. However, even with more 
  rigid lending practices, it estimates that 40 percent of the 
  defaulted loans would still have been made. A mid-Louisiana director 
  indicates that bank loan demand remains down and that little effort 
  is being made to compete for certificates of deposit. The S&amp;Ls in 
  this area have dropped mortgage rates below 9 percent and reduced in 
  half the points charged to close loans; but mortgage lending has not 
  responded.
     </p>
     <p>
      While crop plantings have benefited from a period of good weather, 
  over 50 percent of Louisiana's and 20 percent of Mississippi's 
  cotton acreage remained unplanted at the end of May; this is an 
  unusually late date for planting cotton. Soybean planting also 
  trails normal progress in these two states. District farmers seem 
  concerned over the threat of further fuel price increases. Wind 
  damage to Louisiana's state and national forest lands is estimated 
  at more than 20,000 acres. The forestry services are making plans to 
  attempt to salvage as much as 40 million board feet of prime timber 
  felled by storms. Florida's tomato crop was excellent. Citrus prices 
  are reported as poor except for grapefruit, where Japanese buying 
  held up prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Residential construction has not as yet developed a noticeable 
  recovery, despite large inflows at S&amp;Ls. As reported last month, the 
  housing tax credit is apparently having only a slight impact on 
  reducing the stock of unsold houses. A large Florida housing builder 
  reports a large inflow of new orders recently. Residential 
  construction in the St. Petersburg area has improved slightly; but 
  in the Miami area, the housing situation is still bleak, and many 
  construction workers have moved out of the area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Commercial and industrial construction projects continue to be 
  announced. IBM has announced plans to build an 11-story office 
  building in the Atlanta area. The Coca-Cola Company has announced 
  plans for a $50 million expansion project that will include a 20- to 
  30-story office building. Republic Steel Corporation has recently 
  announced plans to spend $350 million at its Gadsden, Alabama, 
  plant; the project will increase the plant's raw material output by 
  more than 1 million tons annually. Dow Chemical will build two new 
  petrochemical plants in Louisiana at a cost of $25 million. The 
  German chemical firm, Degussa, announced another $10 million plant 
  in their Mobile, Alabama, complex. This brings the grand total of 
  their investment to over $100 million thus far.
