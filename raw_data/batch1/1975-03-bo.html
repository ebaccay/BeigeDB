      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      For the directors of the New England region, the outlook has 
  stabilized. Formerly, they were concerned about the signs of rapid 
  deterioration; now they note a pause in the erosion. Although the 
  directors are generally more hopeful, they are not yet anticipating 
  that the economy is on the threshold of recovery. January 
  unemployment in New England is 9.5 percent, up .7 from December and 
  3 points from the previous January. Rhode Island has a 12 percent 
  unemployment rate, the region's highest, while Massachusetts and 
  Connecticut report rates of 10 percent and 8.6 percent, 
  respectively.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors in Massachusetts and Connecticut have specifically 
  mentioned concerns about state budget trends. Economic weakness has 
  brought deficits, and state authorities are undertaking major 
  efforts to reduce spending and increase taxes. It is felt that these 
  reactions will retard recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      In New England, only the industries connected with defense projects 
  seem to be doing well. Despite the strength of United Aircraft and 
  Electric Boat, one director's index of business activity for 
  Connecticut is forecast to be 110 for 1976 (1967=100), 3 percent 
  below 1974. Profits reports are generally dismal: "Fourth-quarter 
  reports are full of minuses, with few exceptions".
     </p>
     <p>
      Consequently, there will be a period of time before business is 
  willing to commit important outlays for expansion. A director 
  involved with the production of fasteners, milling machines, and 
  machine tools reports that new orders are down sharply. His personal 
  indexes for the direction of business activity cause him worry; May 
  and June will bring reduction of output. Several directors have 
  reported that suppliers are stepping up shipments (steel, for 
  example) by as much as six months in addition to padding orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Those connected with the production of automobile parts have noted a 
  stabilization of conditions. It appears that the industry has 
  adjusted production to a level consistent with a 6 million unit 
  year. Housing starts have all but disappeared. One director mentions 
  that low sales volume has placed pressure on him to increase prices. 
  Reduced rates of utilization of factors of production require larger 
  margins to cover overhead.
     </p>
     <p>
      For retail sales, "there is no spring optimism". Orders are down, 
  and consumer resistance is in the air. Promotions are common from 
  supermarkets to hard goods. A director notes that his sales are 
  running well, compared with his modest planning. His inventories are 
  under control. However, manufacturers have significant overhang so 
  that the director attempts to remain liquid, capitalizing on 
  distress sales. "Massively heavy promotions" are to continue.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers seem to expect a 7 percent prime to prevail for the second 
  half of 1975. They also note that quality loan customers are moving 
  into bond issues whenever possible, leaving low-quality paper. There 
  seems to be a reticence to embark on a growth binge again, and 
  construction lending will be approached with serious caution. 
  Bankers also note that year-end statements show high inventory 
  figures which require attention.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prospects of a large tax cut have made Eckstein much more sanguine 
  about the economic outlook. He now believes that the tax cut, 
  combined with a monetary policy which lets the Treasury bill rate 
  remain at 4 percent, will allow the economy to experience real 
  growth rates of 3-4 percent in the second half of 1975 and even more 
  vigorous growth in 1976. He believes that the role of the Federal 
  Reserve in the next six months is to allow businesses to 
  rehabilitate their balance sheets by creating market conditions in 
  which corporations will be able to float long-term securities. 
  Eckstein also noted that the Fed should be encouraging banks to make 
  loans. The Fed, he argued, should put in abeyance its program of 
  capital adequacy because "it is grossly inappropriate to the current 
  situation".
     </p>
     <p>
      While Eckstein was optimistic about a recovery, he did note that a 
  sharp housing recovery is crucial to his scenario. If the banks 
  refuse to make construction loans, he argued that the Fed must make 
  them do so.
     </p>
     <p>
      Duesenberry expressed qualms about the early and strong upturn in 
  Eckstein's forecast. He believes that demand may be much weaker than 
  in past recoveries because the decline in real disposable income is 
  much greater and because there is a big overhang of unsold houses 
  and condominiums. He feels the present situation is most similar to 
  the housing picture in 1963. He notes that the $20 billion upturn in 
  residential construction forecast by the DRI model is as large as 
  the whole tax cut and if it doesn't occur, there will be no second-half upturn.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor Solow remarks that further easing will not lead to a 
  sudden expansion. He believes that the real guide to the leniency of 
  monetary policy at this time is the level of long-term interest 
  rates. Consequently, he advocates an aggressive policy designed to 
  reduce the cost of long-term financing. He suggests a revival of 
  operation twist. Although Professor Solow admits this experiment was 
  not a "terrific success" in the past, "nothing awful happened". "It 
  is wrong to watch money demand decay and short-term interest rates 
  fall and say the Fed is doing its job." A revival of the economy 
  will revive Ml figures. The economy is not poised to inflate, in his 
  view, and he feels aggressive fiscal policy coupled with concomitant 
  monetary ease is necessary to germinate recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein, Solow, and Duesenberry all expect second-half recoveries. 
  However, Solow and Duesenberry see only modest growth, and they feel 
  the risk is that they are being optimistic. Eckstein sees a more 
  vigorous recovery, but it is predicated on monetary and fiscal 
  policy sufficiently aggressive to cause a significant resurgence of 
  housing. All three advocate more monetary ease.
