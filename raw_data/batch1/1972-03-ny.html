       A moderately more optimistic picture of the economic outlook, as 
compared to last month, emerged from opinions expressed by the 
directors of the New York Bank and the Buffalo branch, and other 
businessmen. Consumer spending appears to have strengthened 
somewhat, while business confidence was reported to have improved 
moderately. The unemployment situation continues unsatisfactory, but 
is apparently a little better than earlier in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consumer spending, which for the retail industry as a whole had been 
relatively sluggish in February, seems to have quickened in the very 
recent past, with scattered indications of increased sales of higher 
priced items. Among the directors, a senior official of the largest 
upstate firm felt that the underlying trend of consumer spending has 
continued to improve, and saw evidence of increased consumer 
willingness to trade-up in the strong sales of his firm's new movie 
cameras. A head-office director referred to an across-the-board rise 
in airline travel and to a "dramatic" increase in domestic 
television sets sales, while another director, an upstate 
businessman, noted that, in his area, sales of higher priced 
automobiles were rising more rapidly than those of cheaper models. 
Nevertheless, most of the directors at both the head office and the 
Buffalo branch, did not discern any fundamental changes in 
consumers' attitudes as yet. Among the retailers contacted, an 
official of a high-price and high-quality New York City department 
store with branches in the suburbs reported that, following a rather 
sluggish performance earlier in the year, sales by his firm had 
picked up noticeably so far in March, and while he remained 
cautious, he felt that 1972 would be a good year for his firm. 
Similarly, the vice-president of a large nationwide chain of 
department stores reported a strengthening in consumer demand at his 
firm's stores in the recent past and, notwithstanding the rather 
slow start earlier this year, looked for a significantly better 
retail sales performance in 1972 as compared to 1971-both for his 
firm and the retail trade industry in general. Finally, an official 
of a medium-price retail store chain, which has experienced a 
gradual increase in business since last fall, stated that he expects 
this trend to continue and noted that in the past month there had 
been a significant increase in his firm's sale of big-ticket items 
such as furniture and home appliances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also encouraging was a report of some firming in business 
confidence. Among the Buffalo branch directors, the president of a 
Rochester bank traced this strengthening to the "slightly better" 
profit outlook, while the chairman of the board of a Buffalo bank 
felt that the recent stock market strength mirrored an improved 
mood; he also reported some pickup in machine tool orders in recent 
months. In addition, another upstate banker pointed to the 
relatively "ambitious" capital spending plans in his area, while a 
senior official of a food processing company pointed to a recent 
sharp rise in farmers' borrowings from agricultural financial 
institutions which he felt reflected a significant increase in 
farmers' capital spending. Among the head-office directors: the 
chairman of a large New York City bank stated that there had been 
"some general improvement" in business confidence, an upstate banker 
saw signs of willingness to spend on plant and equipment, while a 
New Jersey and an upstate New York banker both felt there had been a 
modest improvement in business confidence in their areas. However, 
at a meeting of business leaders held at this Bank, a senior 
official of a large nationwide conglomerate stated that while he 
looked for a rise in capital spending in certain industries, other 
sectors such as the space and aircraft industries would not likely 
increase such outlays. He also noted that most manufacturers are "a 
bit wary" and more reluctant than in the mid-1960s to embark upon 
large-scale capital outlays. As in previous months, some businessmen 
felt that most of the capital outlays would be largely limited to 
environmental control purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was some evidence at this time of an upturn in inventory 
outlays. The president of a large metal processing corporation 
reported some inventory buildup in the metal industry, but primarily 
as a hedge against expected price increases in copper. Another 
director referred to a rebuilding of inventories in computer related 
lines. The retailers that were contacted, however, all reported that 
while their firms were increasing inventories somewhat in view of 
their expectations of increased sales, such outlays were being kept 
under tight control. The current inventory outlook was perhaps best 
summed up at the Buffalo branch directors' meeting where it was 
noted that businesses had "learned to live" with lower inventories, 
and are becoming less concerned about the occurrence of "stock-outs".
      </p>
      <p>
       Although the respondents saw no dramatic changes in labor market 
conditions over the past month, there were no further reports of 
cost-cutting layoffs and in fact several respondents saw some 
strengthening in the demand for labor, particularly skilled workers. 
Some improvement thus was noted in the Rochester area, while a 
senior official of the largest upstate firm observed that 
unemployment rates for experienced workers were trending down. The 
New Jersey banker stated that there had been a "fair" improvement in 
the job market in his area, and that it was harder to get qualified 
workers. A similar sentiment regarding skilled workers had also been 
expressed by a senior official of the country's largest 
communication firm. Finally a director reported that his company's 
efforts to improve productivity through reductions in production 
workers had been ''somewhat overdone'' and that his firm was now 
increasing its work force by a few hundred workers. On the other 
hand, a number of respondents looked for little change in the 
unemployment picture in the near future. The official of the large 
manufacturing conglomerate did not expect a quick rebound in 
manufacturing employment, while the chairman of a large department 
store chain expressed the belief that unemployment benefits and high 
welfare payments are “geared to keep the unemployment rate high”.
