     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall impression that emerges from the responses of Second 
District directors and other business leaders that were contacted 
recently is a slowing down in the rate of decline in business 
activity, and that the economy might be approaching a "bottoming" 
point. Although retail sales, in real terms, continued below last 
year's levels. Retailers reported some improvement in the recent 
past, and, in general, were cautiously optimistic regarding the 
outlook for the second half of the year. Good progress toward the 
reduction of excessive inventories, at the retail as well as at the 
manufacturing level, has apparently been made. The majority of the 
respondents felt that most large cutbacks in business capital 
spending plans had already occurred. And there were scattered 
indications that housing activity might pick up in the coming 
months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Views expressed by retailers regarding consumer spending were mixed, 
  but, on balance, were somewhat more optimistic than in previous 
  months. A senior official of a nationwide chain of department stores 
  reported that, following a sluggish performance in the first two 
  months of 1975, his firm's business had improved somewhat in March, 
  possibly because Easter came early this year. While he did not 
  expect a pronounced improvement over the near term, he was hopeful 
  that sales would pick up smartly in the second half of the year, 
  especially in the fourth quarter. An official of a high quality New 
  York City department store with branches in the suburbs reported 
  that sales over the Easter season had been much stronger than 
  expected, and expressed "guarded optimism" regarding the outlook 
  over the coming months. Similar sentiments were expressed by a 
  number of other retailers.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retailers, however, in general were not overly sanguine 
  regarding the impact on consumer spending of the tax rebate provided 
  for in the new tax bill. The chairman of a large New York City 
  department store did feel that such rebates potentially might have 
  strong psychological impact on consumer attitudes and provide some 
  help to the retail business. Other respondents, however, were more 
  restrained. One retailer noted that it might have some favorable 
  impact on consumer spending, but that it was hard to determine to 
  what extent. The Buffalo Branch directors felt that the restoration 
  of consumer confidence was the key to increased consumer spending, 
  and that the new tax bill would be only mildly stimulative despite 
  expected widespread use for debt reduction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Perhaps the most positive development reported by most respondents 
  was rapid progress made toward reducing excessive inventories. At 
  the retail level, the official of the nationwide department store 
  chain reported that his firm's inventory had been reduced sharply 
  and was not at a desired level, and indeed for certain lines 
  somewhat below desired levels. He felt that this was true for the 
  retail industry, generally, and that the firm's suppliers, at the 
  wholesale as well as the manufacturing level, were also making good 
  progress in that direction. Other retailers reported similar 
  experiences. The chairman of a large New York City bank noted that 
  industry had approached the problem of inventory reduction with "unusual vigor" once it was recognized. At the retail level, 
  including the auto industry, the worst part of the problem should be 
  out of the way by mid-year, while further reductions at the basic 
  materials level are likely to continue for most of the year. A 
  Buffalo Branch director felt that many industries have now reached 
  their desired inventory levels, and that the process should be 
  completed by mid-year or before. A senior official of another large 
  New York City bank, who last month had stated that too many 
  manufacturers were maintaining excessive inventory positions, now 
  felt that, on the basis of conversations with his bank's directors 
  and corporate clients, good progress toward reducing such 
  inventories had been made since then.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding business capital spending, the chairman of. the New York 
  City bank mentioned above stated that major cutbacks in plans for 
  such outlays probably have already been made. Such cutbacks were 
  particularly pronounced among utilities and consumer goods related 
  industries. Capital spending plans in basic materials industries 
  have held up well, a situation he expects to continue given the 
  inadequate capacity for the long run in these industries. The 
  Buffalo Branch directors in general considered it unlikely that 
  further large cutbacks in capital spending plans would occur. There 
  already has been an intensive reevaluation of such programs, and 
  projects which met the "more stringent" profitability tests would 
  move ahead on schedule. The executive vice-president of a large New 
  York City bank stated that the worst of the cuts in capital spending 
  plans were "behind us." Such cuts were announced at the turn of the 
  year when, in his view, the economic outlook appeared gloomiest. He 
  felt that the atmosphere had now brightened, and that the capacity 
  ceiling in a number of industries could be reached again rapidly.
     </p>
     <p>
      Concerning home building activity, the Buffalo Branch directors did 
  not see any signs indicating an early upturn in such activity, even 
  though mortgages were more readily available at declining rates. In 
  their view, the high cost of home ownership and the lack of consumer 
  confidence were major deterrents to an upturn in the housing 
  industry. Other respondents were slightly more optimistic. This 
  attitude was best summed up by an official of a trade association 
  who pointed to the "massive" inflow of funds into Second District 
  thrift institutions and to the easing of mortgage loan terms, and 
  reported that some, albeit quite limited, recovery in new 
  commitments by these institutions was just getting under way. He 
  also noted that the inventory of unsold new houses was smaller in 
  New York State than in certain other parts of the country. Because 
  of the latter situation, however, he felt that the $2,000 tax credit 
  toward the purchase of a new house provided for in the tax bill 
  would have only a limited impact on housing activity in this 
  District.
