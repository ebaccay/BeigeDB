      <p>
       The overall impression that emerges from the individual District Red 
Book reports is one of continuing improvement in the economic 
outlook. Consumer spending is apparently on the rise, with 
indications of heightened interest in nonessential or postponable 
goods and in both big ticket and higher priced items. New orders, 
shipments and backlogs of industrial goods are reportedly 
strengthening, while business confidence is improving noticeably. 
These favorable developments, however, have not as yet been 
translated into a significant turnaround in the cautious inventory 
policies of businesses, and are still reflected only to a moderate 
extent in actual or planned increases in outlays for plant and 
equipment. Similarly, the increase in sales and production has not 
as yet found its counterpart in a sharp rise in the demand for 
labor, although it has reportedly led to a limited improvement in 
the unemployment picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to consumer spending for goods and services, evidence 
of strengthening of consumer confidence can be discerned in reports 
to the New York Bank of increased purchases of nonessential goods 
and of big ticket items, and the fact that sales of durables are 
much more vigorous than those of nondurable goods in the Chicago 
area, with recreational vehicles such as motorcycles, golf carts, 
snowmobiles and similar items leading the field. In addition, 
several banks report a sharp uptrend in passenger airline traffic 
and Atlanta reports booming tourist business in Florida. And while 
sentiments were mixed in the Philadelphia District, retailers are 
expecting sales of home furnishings to be strong as a result of the 
high level of housing completions in the area. A note of caution, 
however, was sounded by some San Francisco bank respondents who 
questioned whether consumer spending would become much stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning construction outlays, most District reports referring to 
activities in that industry and/or related industries, indicated 
that residential, and in some cases (Atlanta) nonresidential 
construction, continues to be a strong element in the current 
economic recovery. Some banks, however, including San Francisco, 
Chicago and Boston, report some feeling among their respondents that 
a leveling-off in the industry is probably in the offing.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for industrial activity manufacturers participating in the 
Philadelphia monthly Business Outlook Survey report a further pickup 
in new orders and shipments in February, which is expected to 
accelerate in March, while Chicago manufacturers of TV sets, 
furniture and home appliances are said to be very pleased with the 
trend of sales. Increases in varying degrees in orders, shipments 
and backlogs-often linked either to a rise in consumer demand or to 
strong construction activity-are also mentioned by several other 
Banks, including Richmond and St. Louis. The Dallas Bank notes that 
the Texas industrial production interest rose to a record level in 
January.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite the apparent strengthening of the economic recovery, 
District reports, however, generally note that businessmen are still 
maintaining cautious inventory policies at this juncture, and that 
no significant turnaround in such policies is indicated for the near 
future. The current inventory picture is well summed up by the 
results of the latest Minneapolis Industrial Expectations Survey, 
which indicate that nearly three quarters of the responding 
manufacturers considered their inventory positions to be 
satisfactory, with the balance equally divided between those who 
considered their inventories too high or too low. Similar sentiments 
were expressed by several other banks, although Chicago reported 
that an increasing number of firms showed concern over the adequacy 
of their inventories to meet rising demands.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning business outlays for plant and equipment, Philadelphia 
reports that an increasing number of area manufacturers are planning 
to boost capital outlays, with firms contacted that planned 
increases outnumbering those planning cut-backs 10 to 1. Atlanta 
reports that previously postponed capital improvements at airports 
and other nonresidential projects will now be implemented. Cleveland 
notes that truck production and sales were at record levels, while 
both the Chicago and New York Banks saw evidence of a sharp rise in 
agricultural capital spending. On the other hand, St. Louis notes 
that capital expenditures are being delayed as long as possible, as 
its business respondents express reluctance to make major 
investments in view of the uncertainties surrounding profit 
prospects, and San Francisco reports a conservative attitude by 
local businessmen toward new capital investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the unemployment picture, reports vary among the District 
banks, but on balance suggest some limited improvement. Richmond 
thus reports sharp increases in manufacturing employment, as well as 
a substantial rise in the trade and services industries. The 
Philadelphia and New York Banks both had evidence that some firms 
were adding to their payrolls, while the Dallas Bank indicated that 
a rise in employment, notably in the construction industry, had 
lowered the jobless rate in the District to its lowest level in more 
than a year. According to reports to the Atlanta Bank, unemployment 
was " low" in East Tennessee, and scattered improvement was seen 
elsewhere in that District. There has also been some increase in 
employment in the lumber industry in the San Francisco District. The 
Cleveland Bank notes a continued small recovery into January in non-farm employment, but expects no major improvement at this time. 
Similarly, Chicago notes that employers have been very cautious in 
increasing their work force, and St. Louis reports that apart from 
some gains in the construction and service trades, additions to 
payrolls are being delayed.
