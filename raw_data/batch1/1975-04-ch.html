      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although general business activity continues to decline in the 
  Seventh District, there are signs that the rate of decline is 
  slowing. Job and product markets are much more competitive and 
  prices of various industrial products have declined. A heavy 
  snowfall on April 2 disrupted transportation and output in Chicago 
  and southern Michigan for a day or so. Output schedules for autos, 
  appliances, and some other consumer goods have been raised 
  moderately and tentatively from very depressed levels, mainly 
  because rapid inventory liquidations resulted in stockouts of 
  certain products. Weakness in capital goods is spreading. The farm 
  sector remains relatively strong. Residential construction appears 
  to be heading for a modest revival. Most analysts project some 
  growth in real GNP in the third quarter, helped by slower inflation, 
  inventory reductions, and more stimulative monetary and fiscal 
  policy. Most "monetarists," however, see "the turn" delayed for at 
  least one or two additional quarters. Many businessmen and lenders 
  are concerned that steps to bolster activity will accelerate the 
  inflation rate later this year or next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Output of autos, trucks, appliances (both large and small), and some 
  materials and components is scheduled to rise moderately in the next 
  month or two, less because of stronger demand than because of 
  inventory reductions that left some gaps. Producers of certain 
  products, for example, fasteners, small metal parts, and certain 
  home furnishing materials, report very spotty demand with 
  improvement in some areas, while others are severely depressed. 
  Demand for some construction equipment associated with home 
  building, very weak last year, has increased in some cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite scattered improvements, virtually all industries are 
  operating at reduced levels, most far below capacity, with no sign 
  of an early reversal. Steel mills, which continued to operate at 
  effective capacity throughout 1974, began to cut workweeks and lay 
  off workers in March.
     </p>
     <p>
      Last year's severe shortages are only a fading memory except for 
  natural gas, fertilizer, and a few special items, mainly components 
  for heavy capital equipment. Lead times have been reduced sharply, 
  deliveries are more dependable, and complaints of poor quality are 
  less frequent. Products such as metal fasteners, paper, motors, and 
  electronic components, which often sold at premiums last year, are 
  now discounted—heavily in some cases. Certain bolts that brought 
  $35 per thousand last summer are now readily available at $8.50. 
  Market prices of some electronic components were cut in half in the 
  first quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Much price cutting takes the form of negotiated discounts or changes 
  in terms of trade, with list prices unchanged. Such adjustments are 
  said to be more prevalent than in the past because of fears that 
  price controls will be reinstated. Manufacturers and large retailers 
  are "putting a squeeze" on suppliers. Price escalators have largely 
  disappeared and prices for future delivery are being quoted on a 
  firm basis for longer periods. However, in many sectors higher 
  prices are likely to hold. Prices of many types of components and 
  finished equipment are 15 to 25 percent or more higher than a year 
  ago. An insurance company reports that its price index on auto parts 
  is up 40 percent from a year ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Strength in capital goods, which sustained many District centers 
  through 1974, is ebbing rapidly. Demand for equipment for mining, 
  off-shore drilling, petro-chemicals, and pollution control is still 
  very strong. Markets for farm equipment will be more competitive 
  because producers are rapidly rebuilding badly depleted inventories. 
  Output of railroad equipment continues at a high level, but many 
  freight cars are in storage. Only open hopper cars are now in short 
  supply. Builders of large vessels for the Great Lakes, although 
  operating at high rates, say order backlogs are disappearing. Oil 
  companies say that the end of depletion and changes in tax treatment 
  of foreign earnings will reduce exploration budgets. Producers of 
  various capital goods report cancellations of orders as well as 
  postponements and stretchouts. Reduced demand for products and 
  reduced cash flow are cited as reasons. A producer of construction 
  and materials handling equipment says, however, that the "explosive" rate of order cancellations that started late last year has 
  moderated. Producers of components for equipment report that the 
  decline in orders, very sharp in late 1974 and early 1975, has 
  leveled off—even reversed in some cases. A number of companies say 
  that European orders have held up better than domestic business. 
  Some believe that the dollar is now substantially undervalued 
  relative to various other currencies. There is no evidence that the 
  increase in the investment tax credit (to 10 percent) has affected 
  sales of equipment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The decline in employment and the rise of unemployment continues in 
  most centers, but probably at a slower pace. Factory work layoffs 
  continue and many companies are trimming office workers and 
  executives—often by forcing early retirement. Total employment is 
  not being sustained, as in the past, by the service sectors. Many 
  utilities are reducing staff, and jobs in finance and retail trade 
  are not expanding significantly. The City of Detroit has announced a 
  25 percent staff reduction to help balance its fiscal 1976 budget.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large general merchandisers, other than "discounters," were 
  disappointed with March sales—far below last year after adjustment 
  for inflation. The early Easter clearly didn't help. Retailers' 
  inventories are reported to be in good shape after reductions 
  starting in late 1974.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although construction contracts and building permits in the District 
  remained at very low levels through February, there are reports that 
  improved availability of credit is beginning to activate 
  transactions. Savings inflows at S&amp;Ls have been very favorable. 
  These institutions have been able to repay debt and are actively 
  seeking mortgages. Developers of various residential and commercial 
  projects are coming out of hibernation after 6-8 months. Rapid 
  release of impounded water and sewer funds would help construction 
  activity.
