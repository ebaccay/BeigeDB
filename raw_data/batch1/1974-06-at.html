      Beige Book Report: Atlanta

       June 12, 1974
      </strong>

      <p>
       Inflation continues to be of uppermost importance to most 
businessmen contacted this month. Most expressed concern over the 
current fiscal policy stance but wholeheartedly urged continuation 
of a restricted current credit policy as a means of restraining 
inflation. Material shortages continue to plague the District 
economy; labor shortages were also apparent in some areas. Again, 
several announcements of capital spending plans were noted, some by 
foreign-based firms. Tourist activity has picked up, but auto sales 
remain substantially below year-ago levels. Some businessmen have 
indicated limited inventory building from fear of continued material 
shortages. The much publicized fertilizer shortage is apparently not 
as critical as earlier expected. The new minimum wage has had only 
scattered distorting impact on District labor markets so far.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from many District businessmen confirm the heightened 
concern over inflation. The term "double digit inflation" is 
creeping into many businessmen's conversations. They see little 
relief in sight, with the continued shortages of materials and 
upcoming wage negotiations putting upward pressure on costs the 
remainder of this year. These businessmen see "double digit 
inflation" leading to a growing lack of confidence in our entire 
financial system. In order to combat inflation and restore 
confidence, there seems to be universal agreement that a restrictive 
monetary policy is needed for some time to come.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be little relief in sight from the materials 
shortages which have been affecting many businesses and 
manufacturers. Several construction contractors have noticed a 
loosening in building material supplies. However, District 
manufacturers continue to report difficulty and longer waiting 
periods in obtaining all metals and metal products, paper, and 
plastic pipe. As reported earlier, some layoffs and increases in 
unemployment have occurred in parts of the District. However, 
shortages of skilled workers and craftsmen exist in many areas. 
Economic activity along the Alabama and Mississippi Gulf Coast is 
booming. Several new plant announcements have recently been 
reported. The most recent is a new $40-million cement-manufacturing 
facility south of Mobile, Alabama; it will be financed through 
revenue bonds. Tourist activity continues to pick up. The Disney 
World and the Daytona Beach areas are booming. Tourist and 
convention business is still strong in New Orleans, particularly at 
the downtown hotels. Auto sales, though improving recently, remain 
well below year-ago levels in the District. The regional office of 
one of the big three auto manufacturers indicates that for the first 
ten days of May, auto sales in the Southeast are 24 percent below 
the year-ago period. One brighter note is that truck sales, 
particularly small trucks, are down only fractionally from a year 
ago. A report from an importer of Japanese-made cars indicates that 
unit sales in the Southeast are behind the comparable period last 
year; but the spokesman said that sales would be ahead if there were 
cars to sell. Apparently a dock strike in Japan kept them from 
getting cars to fill all the orders. Several announcements have been 
made of foreign manufacturers locating plants in the Sixth District; 
ten such announcements have been made so far this year. In April 
alone, four were made, 20 percent of the U. S. total.
      </p>
      <p>
       A survey of several District manufacturers indicates some hedged 
inventory building has taken place in this region, particularly in 
steel, paper, fuel oil, and critical machine parts. However, in many 
cases, manufacturers were simply unable to build inventories because 
of shortages. Several manufacturers did mention longer lead times in 
placing orders today. In response to why they were attempting to 
build inventories, all manufacturers agreed that fear of continued 
shortages rather than expectations of higher prices down the road 
was the major reason. There was universal agreement that shortages 
would continue for some time to come. They also indicated that 
building inventories strictly for an inflationary hedge would not be 
profitable today because of the high cost of carrying inventories 
(i.e., high interest rates on inventory loans). Some indication was 
given of turning to commercial banks for short-term financing of 
this inventory building.
      </p>
      <p>
       Summer supplies do appear adequate for fuel supplies to utilities. 
The power companies which burn natural gas had supplies curtailed 
somewhat last winter because the Federal Power Commission has 
diverted gas to the Northeast, but no problems are expected this 
summer other than rising fuel prices. One electric utility which had 
been burning 100 percent natural gas now has the capability of 
burning 40 percent fuel oil, thus being better prepared for fuel 
emergencies. A Louisiana power company which had been a 100-percent 
natural gas user has announced plans to build a coal-fired plant 
using low sulfur western coal scheduled for completion in 1978 and 
costing $150 million. Coal-burning utilities in the Southeast are 
finding it difficult to build inventories. A severe coal miners' 
strike is expected, but inventories cannot be increased because of 
the closing of some mines. Coal supplies are apparently adequate for 
current consumption needs, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there is a tight market for fertilizer, supplies appear 
adequate. Earlier reports indicate that fertilizer shortages might 
precipitate switching some corn acreage into soybeans, but this does 
not seem to be happening in the District. Heavy rains in the 
Mississippi Delta area are delaying some cotton plantings. Because 
of a lack of cold weather this winter, the Georgia peach crop may be 
as much as 25 percent below last year's.
      </p>
      <p>
       A telephone survey of employment security offices in the District 
indicates only scattered and very limited distortions from the 
increased minimum wage enacted on May 1. Most analysts report it was 
too early to tell what the total effect would be. However, some 
domestic workers, yardmen, porters, janitors, and farm laborers are 
apparently out of work because of the increase in the minimum wage. 
One report from a large Georgia city indicated that some women have 
quit their jobs rather than pay the higher cost of employing 
domestics.
