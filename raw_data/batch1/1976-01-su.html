      Beige Book: National Summary
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 14, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        This month's Red Book reports suggest that economic activity is 
continuing to expand, but that the upward impetus is narrowly based. 
The most optimistic sector is retail trade, where Christmas sales as 
well as automobile sales in several Districts were stronger than 
expected. However, only a modest recovery in inventory spending is 
anticipated as retailers maintain tight inventory control and as 
some durable manufacturers continue to trim excessive stocks. 
Caution characterizes the capital spending outlook, with weakness 
expected in some sizable industries. Led by activity in the single-
family area, construction is generally expected to continue its 
modest rate of recovery. Although most respondents did not foresee 
any near-term acceleration in inflation, some concern was expressed 
over construction costs and the outcome of the heavier bargaining
calendar in 1976. One favorable aspect of the price outlook comes 
from the agricultural sector where there are generally expected to 
be increased supplies of pork and beef. Loan demand at commercial 
banks is generally expected to remain sluggish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strong gains in consumer spending were reported throughout the 
twelve Districts. Sales far exceeded expectations in several 
districts including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Minneapolis, and 
Dallas. Very strong sales were reported even in some areas in the 
Boston and Cleveland districts where high unemployment was expected 
to have adverse effects on consumer buying. Some reluctance toward 
the purchase of "big-ticket" items was reported in New York and 
Richmond, but Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Minneapolis all reported 
increases in this category. Auto sales were surprisingly strong in 
Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and San Francisco, while 
tourism was thriving in both the Atlanta and the Minneapolis 
Districts.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the brisk pace of retail activity has significantly pared 
stocks, some progress remains to be made in trimming manufacturing 
inventories. For example, respondents from the Atlanta, Boston, and 
Chicago Districts reported that Christmas sales were so strong that 
stocks are now fairly low. However, retailers and purchasing 
managers in the Minneapolis and Kansas City Districts foresaw fears 
of overstocking as motivating tight inventory control policies. At 
the manufacturing level, respondents in the Philadelphia and 
Richmond Districts noted that durable manufacturing inventory 
liquidation had yet to be completed. Purchasing agents from the 
Kansas City District suggested that the rather modest outlook for 
inflation for most products precluded much in the way of speculative 
buildups. In view of these considerations, the typical outlook was 
for only a moderate first-half upturn in inventory spending.
       </p>
       <p>
        A large measure of caution seems to surround the prospects for a 
recovery in capital spending in 1976. For example, respondents in 
the New York and Chicago Districts among others did not foresee more 
than a modest recovery until at least the second half of the year. 
One of the problems emphasized in the Dallas and Cleveland Districts 
was the considerable proportion of capital expenditures represented 
by pollution abatement requirements in the petroleum refining and 
steel industries. In the energy sector, Dallas respondents report 
that fixed investment in the drilling area remains strong. However, 
investment in petroleum refining is expected to be below last year's 
level reflecting, in part, refiners' expectations that higher 
petroleum costs will result in a long-term flattening out in demand 
for many refinery products. In the San Francisco District another 
sizable area of concern was the aircraft industry where a decline in 
new orders for commercial jets has prompted a significant cutback in 
plant and equipment expenditures for 1976.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction and real estate activity remain generally depressed, 
although there were a few signs of strengthening. Atlanta and 
Minneapolis both report continued sluggishness in new residential 
construction but increased interest in the existing housing stock. 
San Francisco reports that the anticipated improvement in 
residential construction has not yet materialized. St. Louis 
presents a somewhat brighter picture, reporting a strengthening in 
single-family dwellings as well as in non-residential construction. 
Chicago and Dallas also report a continued improvement in 
residential construction activity. But commercial construction, with 
few exceptions, is still weak. Also, a large number of condominiums 
remain vacant in the Atlanta District, and the construction of
       </p>
       <div>
        multi-family dwellings in the St. Louis District is at a virtual 
  standstill. In a number of Districts, however, sizable inflows to 
  thrift institutions and the possibility of mortgage interest rate 
  declines were cited.
        <p>
        </p>
       </div>
       <p>
        Reports from agricultural areas are generally favorable. Richmond, 
Atlanta, Minneapolis, and Kansas City all expect increases in hog 
production and pork supplies. Improved conditions for cattle 
producers are anticipated in the Atlanta District as they are in 
Minneapolis, Kansas City, and San Francisco. Only the Dallas 
District is somewhat pessimistic, expecting placements of fed cattle 
to fall as their prices continue declining. Minneapolis reports cash 
farm receipts were up from the first half of the year, led by record 
prices for dairy products. Cash receipts for grain, however, were 
below 1974 levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The widespread remaining slack in manufacturing coupled with the 
generally expected near-term sluggishness of capital spending and 
rather modest inventory rebuilding were often mentioned as factors 
holding down inflation at least over the first half of the year. 
Nevertheless, the possibility of uncomfortably large price increases 
in some sectors was recognized by some respondents. For example, a 
Cleveland director reported sharply rising costs for concrete and 
lumber, while one of the nation's largest homebuilders expected a 10 
percent rise in new home prices in 1976. Respondents in the 
Cleveland District also reported that the October 1 rise in steel 
prices appeared to be sticking fairly well, although divergent views 
were expressed elsewhere on the firmness of the aluminum price 
increase. Some concern was voiced over the possible price impact of 
the potential terms of settlements of major wage negotiations in 
1976.
       </p>
       <p>
        A rather broad consensus emerged that loan demand was weak and that 
no strong near-term recovery was in the offing. A number of 
respondents cited tighter inventory control policies as a major 
reason for the prospective sluggishness in loan demand. Reflecting 
this outlook, bankers in the Philadelphia District expected the 
prime rate to edge down somewhat further before starting to move up 
gradually beginning in the second quarter. Bankers from the Boston 
and San Francisco Districts, among others, emphasized the much 
increased concern over quality of credit. With respect to bank 
earnings, these bankers foresaw a weak profit picture for 1976.
