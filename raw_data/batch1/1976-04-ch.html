      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      The business expansion in the Seventh District has broadened and 
  gathered momentum in the past month to a greater extent than most 
  observers had expected. Increased retail sales and reversals of 
  inventory liquidation programs are largely responsible. 
  Substantially higher profits of "better quality" have played a large 
  role in improved business psychology. Consumers are influenced 
  favorably by stronger job markets and slower price inflation. No 
  significant shortages of materials and components are noted as yet, 
  but lead times are lengthening moderately. A broad pickup in capital 
  goods does not appear likely until late in the year. Transactions in 
  existing dwellings and various other types of real estate have been 
"phenomenal," and some residential builders are beginning to 
  reactivate dormant programs.
     </div>
     <p>
      The Teamsters' negotiations apparently were settled with only minor, 
  temporary walkouts in this District, and these were largely confined 
  to the Detroit area. The cost of the Teamsters' 3-year package is 
  difficult to evaluate. A Detroit union official calls the contract "the best we ever got," and says many over-the-road drivers paid by 
  the mile could get $10,400 more per year at the end of 3 years, 
  boosting some into the $30,000 to $35,000 range. This 40 to 50 
  percent boost assumes a 6 percent per year rise in the CPI under the 
  new unlimited COLA. Without COLA increase, the 3-year contract is 
  said to call for a 33 percent rise in costs, with large boost for 
  pension contributions as required by the new law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some knowledgeable analysts in the District are very concerned about 
  a serious rubber industry strike starting next week. For the first 
  time, three or four of the largest producers may be struck 
  simultaneously. The various issues, including a COLA, may not be 
  resolved without a walkout that might last 60 days. Output of autos 
  and trucks probably would be affected in 30 to 40 days as stocks of 
  tires are limited. Many other essential industrial products would be 
  cut off by a rubber strike. Unlike the Teamsters' settlement, the 
  rubber contract eventually decided upon is likely to set a pattern. 
  The main issues in the UAW contracts coming up this fall are not 
  clear, but General Motors has suggested reevaluation of the company-paid medical-dental program which now costs $150 per worker per 
  month and is rising rapidly even without further liberalization of 
  benefits. Chicago lithographers recently agreed to forego a 
  scheduled wage boost in order to slow the migration of printing and 
  graphic arts, but such reports are unusual. Chicago teachers 
  reluctantly agreed to an 8.5 percent salary cut to be achieved by 
  shortening the current school year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Virtually all consumer hard goods, especially autos and most 
  appliances, are selling well again. Sales gains at general 
  merchandise stores for March are very impressive in view of the much 
  later date of Easter this year. General merchandisers are pleased 
  with the improvement in their profit margins, which reflect lower 
  carrying costs of inventories as well as higher volume. Food 
  retailers, however, are having a difficult time maintaining their 
  profit margins in the face of rising costs of labor, transportation, 
  fuel, insurance and other overhead. Increases in these expenses also 
  plague private schools, hospitals, and other institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The increase in sales of autos and light to lower-medium weight 
  trucks has exceeded the hopes of most industry analysts. Inventories 
  of popular models are inadequate to meet sales potential. The 
  increase in sales has been concentrated in the compact and 
  intermediate-sized with the subcompacts and standards losing ground 
  relatively. Better gas mileage on domestic models and relatively 
  improved price relationships have helped reduce the market 
  penetration of imports. Sales of larger trucks have remained at a 
  very depressed level, but output is being expanded to meet an 
  expected rise in demand coming about midyear as truck freight 
  continues to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Purchasing agents' reports for both Chicago and Milwaukee were very 
  promising for March with significant gains in new orders, output 
  and, most recently, employment. More firms are reporting increases 
  in order backlogs, and many are beginning to rebuild inventories of 
  purchased materials and components. Producers of basic materials 
  such as steel and cement are boosting forecasts of output for the 
  year. Steel imports are at a lower rate than most observers had 
  expected, perhaps because foreign producers are reluctant to match 
  U. S. prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers of capital goods components report continued 
  improvement in orders for such products as controls and motors. 
  Partly this reflects "bare bones" inventories of distributors. Some 
  utilities indicate they are moving ahead on deferred capital 
  expenditure programs as financial positions have improved and 
  certain regulatory obstacles have been resolved. Announcements of 
  expanded capital expenditure plans in other industries are rare. 
  Capacity is currently ample in most types of manufacturing, 
  transportation, trade, and finance and vacancy rates in commercial 
  buildings are high, both downtown and in the suburbs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite much talk that "the average family can't afford a home any 
  more," transactions have been at a very brisk pace both in 
  preoccupied units and in new housing. Single-family homes are moving 
  at prices 50 percent higher than 5 years ago in good areas. New 
  building is beginning to revive, but mainly in single-family 
  developments and townhouses.
