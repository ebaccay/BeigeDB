       Second District directors and other business leaders contacted 
recently expressed considerable concern over the energy crisis. 
Shortages of petroleum were viewed as affecting a wide range of 
industries and as likely to lead to a marked reduction in the growth 
of economic activity next year and, perhaps, to a recession. For the 
most part, however, business capital spending plans were expected to 
hold up in spite of the energy situation. The business inventory 
picture was mixed but on balance pointed to attempts to increase 
inventories that may well not succeed because of shortages. The 
respondents expected retailers to enjoy a relatively good holiday 
season, but anticipated a leveling off in sales over the coming 
months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The respondents continued to feel that the shortages and rising 
costs of petroleum products, both as fuel and as raw material, were 
going to have a pronounced adverse effect on virtually all segments 
of the economy. Typical of their assessments of the situation was 
the expectation that supply constraints on output will eventually 
result in a drop-off in demand owing to growing unemployment and 
reduced corporate and individual earnings. Several respondents 
forecast zero or negative growth in real GNP in 1974. A New York 
City banker, a head office director, saw possibilities that the 
shortages might lead to a significant decline in GNP. In his view, 
efforts to curtail industrial and consumer energy consumption might 
ease the problem but not solve it. Similar sentiments regarding the 
overall impact of the energy crisis were expressed by a number of 
other respondents, and senior officials of a wide range of
manufacturing as well as retail firms complained of specific 
problems the petroleum shortage was having on their respective 
firms. Several respondents noted that the energy crisis had been 
building up for some time, and would have emerged in the not too 
distant future even without the Arab embargo, in good part as a 
result of insufficient investment by the oil industry in past years 
in the face of rising worldwide demand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Against this background, the Buffalo directors generally felt that 
the Government's allocation program did not go far enough and that a 
system of rationing was needed. Other respondents variously called 
for tougher and more clear-cut allocation measures that would give 
priority to the maintenance of industrial and agricultural output, 
and for severe cutbacks in non-essential use. Efforts to increase 
domestic fuel supplies were urged, but as several respondents noted, 
a fairly long lead time and very large capital investment would be 
necessary before a significant increase could be expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding business investments, those respondents commenting on 
business capital outlays reported that either their firm or the 
firms of most of their business contacts intended to implement 
current plans with no cutbacks. One respondent, however, qualified 
his remarks by stating that "all bets are off" because of the energy 
crisis. With respect to inventory policy, the retailers stated that 
they intended to keep their stocks on hand under close scrutiny in 
view of the expected leveling off in consumer demand. Other 
respondents, however, felt that businessmen were actively attempting 
to strengthen inventory positions, reflecting fears of increasing 
shortages and higher prices, as well as lower than normal inventory 
positions. Some felt that existing shortages of both raw materials 
and finished goods might well frustrate these efforts, with only a 
slight or no increase in inventories. Several Buffalo branch 
directors, however, believed many businessmen would find substitute 
products to meet their requirements and that such shifts in demand 
might mitigate somewhat the unemployment situation. Some respondents 
mentioned the possibility of a rise in
inventory-to-sales ratios—even of involuntary inventory accumulation—if the expected 
decline in business activity materializes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning consumer spending, senior officials of retail firms who 
were contacted looked for a fairly good holiday season, comparable 
or somewhat better than last year's. These expectations were shared 
by a number of other respondents. However, the respondents in 
general were markedly less ebullient than at this time last year. 
Moreover, most realized that there were "clouds ahead" for the 
retail sales industry. Shortages of goods were expected to become 
more acute as stocks on hand for the holiday season were drawn down. 
On the demand side, tapering off in consumer outlays was expected to 
accompany the anticipated economic slowdown. In addition to the rise 
in unemployment, worries over the economic outlook, resistance to 
high prices and curtailment 
of automobile use to reach shopping 
centers were also cited as factors likely to affect sales adversely.
