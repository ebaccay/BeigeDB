      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Stimulus from consumer goods and a slowing in inventory liquidation 
continue to strengthen manufacturing activity in the Fourth 
District. Capital goods, while still weak, are picking up. 
Manufacturing employment has recovered very little from lows last 
spring. Residential and nonresidential construction activity sagged 
last quarter. Thrift institutions report excellent net deposit 
inflows in January and early February.
       </p>
       <p>
        Producers and retailers of consumer goods are more optimistic about 
sales than they have been in recent months. A major appliance 
producer noted its orders of major appliances so far this year are 
at least 30 percent above a year ago and orders of housewares are at 
least 20 percent higher because of the surge in retail sales and 
bottoming out of inventory liquidation. The same factors account for 
the steady improvement in shipments and sales of passenger car 
tires, according to an economist from a major tire producer. 
Retailers report that January and February sales are about equal to 
the November and December 1975 average after allowance for the usual 
seasonal drop. One retailer reports that sales of major appliances 
last month were better than expected and that sustained improvement 
through 1976 is now likely. His management has become more 
optimistic because consumer sales have consistently exceeded 
expectations since last fall. Another retailer, although cautiously 
optimistic, pointed out that use of charge accounts in their branch 
stores located in depressed auto and steel centers has picked up in 
recent weeks, reversing several months of decline. A director noted 
advertising revenue from television and radio will be up sharply 
this quarter, and that consumer spending for recreation has picked 
up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Financial officers and economists with several firms report that 
inventory reduction for their products has about run its course. One 
director noted that sales of fertilizers and herbicides are soaring. 
A major plastic producer reports that sales of polyvinyl chloride 
rebounded sharply in December and January and that rebuilding of 
stocks will boost output further in coming months. Also, retail and 
manufacturers' stocks of passenger tires decreased last quarter, 
although inventories in this industry are typically built in the 
final quarter of each year. A supplier of frames for trucks reports 
that the big inventory reduction of heavy duty trucks is about 
completed. Economists with major steel producers in the District 
expect reduction of steel inventories will be virtually completed by
the end of this quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Capital goods industries are still generally weak. Producers of farm 
machinery and mining equipment report their business has held up 
relatively well but is below peak levels in late 1974. Orders for 
metal cutting and for forming tools have risen for several months 
but from very depressed levels in early 1975. A producer of 
industrial equipment reports orders so far this year are 20 percent 
below a year ago and not much improvement is expected until the 
second half of 1976. A major supplier of frames to the automotive 
industry expects heavy duty truck sales to rise by 11 percent this 
year in contrast to a 27 percent drop in 1975. He reports orders 
from truck producers have begun to pick up slowly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steel economists in the District report that orders and shipments 
this quarter will be about 20 percent higher than depressed levels 
last quarter. Demand for tubing and drilling pipe used in the 
petroleum industries has softened, but demand for flat roll steel 
products from automotive and appliance producers has strengthened 
gradually. Orders from capital goods producers are not expected to 
pick up until the second half of this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment in the District has risen very little since last spring. 
Scattered cutbacks in manufacturing employment are still occurring 
in primary metals, electrical machinery, and machine tool 
industries. Employment in fabricated metals and rubber and plastic 
products has stabilized. A large machine tool builder reports that 
it may layoff 1,000 of its 6,000 workers by year-end if orders don't 
pick up strongly. Many manufacturers continue to stretch out the 
workweek and hold down additions to their work forces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contracts for both nonresidential and residential building activity 
fell sharply in the District in recent months. Nonresidential 
contracts last quarter followed the mild declining trend that began 
in early 1975. Residential contracts also slumped last quarter 
following a rebound in the second and third quarters of last year. 
Multi-family units remain depressed with little builder-developer 
interest because of existing high vacancies and relatively low 
rental rates. However, one director noted that sales of cabinet and 
counter-top materials rose to a record last month, and a major 
lumber and home-modernization retailer also noted sharp increases in 
sales of home building materials. Mortgage loan demand is seasonally 
weak in most centers of the District. Net savings inflows in January 
were described as excellent by several savings and loan executives. 
These sources describe savings inflows in February as strong despite 
small losses in deposits to the 8 percent Treasury note. Mortgage 
rates in Cleveland were recently reduced 1/4 percent to 8 1/2 
percent for a 30-year, 70 percent loan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Price developments are mixed. Weak markets for cutting tools and 
steel fasteners have prevented price increases for these products 
despite higher steel and wage costs. On the other hand, recent price 
increases for steel products are holding, and a major plastics 
producer reported price increases for polyvinyl chloride in January 
and February are holding because of the recent strong rebound in 
demand. Our latest survey of manufacturers shows some abatement in 
prices last month but more respondents in February than in January 
expect price increases.
