      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Second District directors, businessmen, and business and financial 
economists who were recently contacted generally indicated that they 
were encouraged on the outlook for continued economic recovery. In 
their view, business inventories are now in reasonably good balance 
with sales expectations. With inventories thus realigned, most 
respondents felt that businessmen would pursue cautious inventory 
policies in the coming months, with stocks growing in line with 
sales. A minority of respondents, on the other hand, felt that any 
strengthening of demand should stimulate efforts to stockpile metals 
and would quickly drive up prices. For the most part, however, 
inflation was seen as moderating somewhat further, except in a few 
trouble spots. Some concern was also voiced over the large wage and 
benefit settlements that are likely to be demanded in forthcoming 
collective bargaining negotiations. Liquidity problems, however, 
were generally not viewed as posing any significant threat to the 
recovery this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inventory situation was generally described as in good balance 
with sales. Indeed, according to one director, manufacturers were 
being, if anything, overly cautious in their inventory building. The 
Buffalo directors expected firms to maintain tight inventory 
control, although they saw prospects of "cautious and watchful" 
inventory buildup. The chief economist of a major chemical company, 
whose firm had only recently escaped from a tremendous inventory 
overhang, confirmed that his company was holding a "tight rein" on 
inventories. The president of a major metal company observed that 
inventories in his industry had finally been brought into reasonable 
alignment with current sales. He felt that any strengthening in 
demand would prompt purchasing agents to aggressively seek to 
accumulate inventories. Among other sectors, one financial economist 
looked for increased liquidation of agricultural stocks held over 
from 1975, and also wondered whether severe cold weather would 
sharply reduce stocks of residual fuels.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the outlook for price increases, a majority of respondents 
expected inflation to diminish in coming months, led by slower 
growth in food prices. At the same time, however, price pressures 
were seen developing in a number of sectors. The chairman of a major 
New York City bank expected overall prices to rise in a range of 5 
to 7 percent for the balance of the year. Buffalo directors agreed 
with this assessment, expecting prices to increase 6 percent—somewhat below the recent rate of increase. A slowing in 
agricultural prices was viewed as one of the primary factors 
contributing to a slowdown in the rate of inflation. A director with 
agricultural interests expected food prices to decline and noted
that there was already some evidence that this was occurring. An 
investment banking economist looked for a slowdown in fuel price 
increases in coming months as the result of the lifting of the crude 
oil tariff. Less encouragingly, he foresaw near-term pressures on 
metals prices developing. The president of a major metals company 
also expected rapid industrial wholesale price increases as a result 
of tight operating margins in most industrial concerns. Short-term 
upward pressures on paper and lumber prices were seen as a remnant 
of the Canadian mill workers' strike.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a related subject, a senior economist at a major manufacturer 
that is facing heavy collective bargaining this year felt there was 
little chance of any abatement in the rapid first-year-of-contract 
wage gains that marked last year. In his view, moreover, nonunion 
wage gains would accelerate in order to "catch up" from earlier 
imbalances. He expected hourly compensation to increase at least 9 
percent during 1976, reflecting not only rapid wage and benefit 
increases but also cyclical increases in hours of overtime work and 
changes in the mix of employment among industries. Another business 
economist, on the other hand, expressed the view that continued high 
rates of unemployment would help to restrain wage increases in the 
nonunionized sector, even if some major unions won exceptionally 
generous settlements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Questioned on the possibility that liquidity problems might retard 
economic recovery this year, the directors felt these uncertainties 
had largely faded into the past—either having been resolved or 
close to being resolved. In their view the supply of funds was more 
than ample to support the continuation of a moderate recovery. The 
chairman of a major New York City bank did note, however, that bank 
lending policies were "more conservative and quality-oriented" but 
could not determine if this would become a significant drag on the 
economy. Another director observed that financial institutions had 
apparently become more aggressive in the mortgage market. While not 
foreseeing any near-term balance sheet imbalances, several 
economists of nonfinancial corporations were concerned over the 
longer-term capital problems stemming from the insufficiency of
        <br/>
        internally-generated funds to meet prospective needs for capital 
investment.
