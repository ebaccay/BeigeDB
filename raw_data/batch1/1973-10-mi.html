      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis

       October 10, 1973
      </strong>

       District economic activity remains strong, and despite difficulties 
obtaining materials and labor, businessmen are quite optimistic 
about the future. District retail sales have not yet let up, and 
consumer installment credit has risen at a substantial rate. 
Furthermore, district retailers look for continued sales gains. 
Despite threats of drought and other growing season hazards, the 
outlook is for record crops in the district this fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although district businessmen did not report any softening in 
district business activity, material shortages are restricting 
expansion. A director whose firm manufactures plastic pipe 
indicated, for example, that plastic resins are in very short 
supply; he expected the problem to be critical for the next several 
months. In addition, delivery times on steel products have stretched 
out considerably. Another director from the upper peninsula of 
Michigan disclosed that material shortages exist in his area and 
many businessmen are having to turn to substitute materials. A 
Minneapolis/St. Paul area director revealed that Twin Cities area 
manufacturers are having difficulty obtaining various raw materials—wood, steel, and fuel—and many manufacturers are encountering 
capacity problems. A large Twin Cities area retailer reported that 
merchandise is available, but delivery times are lengthening. A 
South Dakota director disclosed that farm implements remain 
difficult to obtain and a critical fertilizer shortage exists for 
the fall planting. A Montana director stated that his area's retail 
sales would be stronger if merchandise was available and reported 
that agricultural steel products, fertilizer, and farm machinery are 
in short supply.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only are materials difficult to obtain, but district labor 
markets were generally described by bank directors as tight. A 
shortage of construction workers was reported in the Billings area, 
and the hiring of employees for the service industries was 
considered more difficult than a year ago. A Minnesota director 
disclosed that general laborers are in short supply and reported 
that these workers are quitting jobs with increasing frequency. In 
addition, fewer skilled workers are looking for jobs in Minnesota. 
In the upper peninsula of Michigan, on the other hand, an ample 
supply of general laborers exists, but skilled workers are difficult 
to hire. One Twin Cities area director revealed that trained, 
experienced employees are not to be found, while another stated that 
the current labor conditions are tight but not unmanageable. A South 
Dakota director disclosed that labor market conditions are tight in 
his area, especially for farm and construction workers. Directors 
from Montana and North Dakota, however, indicated no shortage of 
agricultural workers in their areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       No significant letup in district consumer spending has yet to occur, 
and district retailers are optimistic about future sales. Major 
Ninth District department/discount stores surveyed by this bank 
reported summer sales exceeded year-earlier levels by as much as 10 
percent, although a few stores noted some slackening toward the end 
of the summer. Several retailers also revealed that about half of 
their recent sales gains stemmed from price increases. Most major 
department/discount stores, particularly those outside the Twin 
Cities, expect to surpass last year's record sales this holiday 
season.
      </p>
      <p>
       District motor vehicle sales rose strongly throughout the summer, 
departing from the usual seasonal pattern. Small cars and trucks 
were the biggest sellers. The gasoline shortage was generally 
credited with spurring smaller car sales, while the 20 to 50 percent 
increases in truck sales were attributed to sharply higher farm 
income. District car dealers are enthusiastic about their future 
sales prospects and do not feel that the exceptionally high 1973 
sales have cut deeply into their 1974 sales potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on data provided by a selected panel of district member banks, 
consumer installment credit extended by district banks this summer 
continued to rise at a rapid rate. A survey of nonbank consumer 
finance institutions indicated that business was unchanged to 
substantially higher compared to a year ago. Commercial banks and 
consumer finance companies reported raising consumer interest rates 
on new car loans by one-half to one percent recently, but otherwise 
terms for consumer installment credit have remained relatively 
unchanged over the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the district enters the final phase of the harvest season, the 
outlook is for record crops in 1973, despite threats of drought and 
other growing season hazards. The wheat and other small grain 
harvest is completed. The district produced 491 million bushels of 
wheat this year, up 17 percent from 1972 and 19 percent from the 
most recent five-year average. The corn and soybean harvests are 
just under way, and record outputs are almost a sure thing. District 
corn production, estimated at 667 million bushels on September 1, is 
up 8 percent from a year ago, 24 percent from the five-year average, 
and is the largest amount ever produced. The anticipated gain in 
soybean production is even greater. Total output of beans is 
expected to reach 175 million bushels, up 28 percent from last year 
and 39 percent from the five-year average.
