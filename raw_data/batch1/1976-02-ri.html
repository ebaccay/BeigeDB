      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        For the second consecutive month Fifth District manufacturing 
activity in January apparently showed little further improvement 
from recent advanced levels. In our latest survey, District 
manufacturers reported that shipments and the volume of new orders 
softened somewhat after several relatively strong months. Backlogs 
of orders and inventories were down slightly in January, but 
inventories relative to desired levels were higher than in recent 
months. Survey responses indicate no change in employment from a 
month earlier, while prices, including employee compensation, 
advanced across a broad front. Current plant and equipment capacity 
remains in excess at one-third of the manufacturing concerns 
surveyed. By contrast, consumer spending apparently remains strong. 
Retailers surveyed were unanimous in reporting increased sales in 
January, even after a very strong December. Sales of big-ticket 
items relative to total sales advanced slightly. Survey respondents 
remain generally optimistic, as most expect business to improve over 
the next six months. Over the past month bank credit at large Fifth 
District banks has fallen sharply, with both loans and investments 
showing declines.
       </p>
       <p>
        Responses to our latest survey of manufacturers indicate little 
further progress toward recovery in the past month. Shipments 
declined for the first time in nine months, while the volume of new 
orders dipped for the second straight month. Declines in these areas 
were slight, but compare with widespread and sizable increases in 
most recent months. Over one-third of our respondents reported 
declines in shipments, new orders, and order backlogs. 
Manufacturers' inventories apparently fell further but more 
respondents now view current inventory levels as excessive than at 
any time since September. Reports from most individual industries 
seem to be consistent with this general description. One exception, 
however, is the machinery and equipment group, which apparently 
experienced considerable improvement in the level of business during 
January.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment in manufacturing apparently remained about level in 
January as did the length of the workweek. Prices continued to rise 
in most areas, as they have done since early last spring. One-third 
of the manufacturers feel current plant and equipment capacity is 
excessive, and almost all respondents view current expansion plans 
as about right.
       </p>
       <p>
        In contrast with the manufacturers, District retailers surveyed 
experienced a continuation of the strong improvement which began in 
December. All survey respondents reported increased sales in 
January. Sales of big-ticket items relative to total sales increased 
somewhat during the month, only the second such increase in over a 
year. Comments of branch directors substantiate this improvement in 
retail sales and include mention of such areas as automobile and 
boat sales as having experienced recent improvement. Despite some 
increase in inventories at retail, survey results show current 
levels as about right to too low. Twenty-five percent of the 
retailers surveyed also view the number and size of their outlets as 
inadequate. Employment at retailers increased during January as did 
employee compensation. Prices, paid and received, also advanced, as 
75 percent of the retailers report them higher than one month ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        District businessmen remain generally optimistic, expecting the 
level of business activity to improve over the next six months. Most 
survey respondents, both manufacturing and retail, expect 
improvement nationally, locally, and in their own firms over that 
period.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Fifth District banks loan demand continues weak. Consumer lending 
has been essentially flat, with neither installment lending nor 
credit card activity reflecting the recent strength in consumer 
purchases. Business loans continue weak. An indication of the slack 
in business lending is the current very low level of credit line 
utilization. One bank reports an all-time low in its credit line 
usage, 21 percent compared to normal usage of about 42 percent. 
Credit lines are not, however, being canceled or allowed to expire. 
Expectations about the future course of business loan demand in the 
Fifth District are mixed. A large North Carolina bank, for example, 
anticipates that production and inventory loans will pick up in 
April, while a large Virginia bank expects no significant rise for 
at least a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farmers in both the District and the nation indicated in early 
January that they intended to plant larger acreages of feedgrains 
and cotton but smaller acreages of soybeans than in 1975. Planned 
increases in District feedgrain and cotton acreages—6 percent and 
30 percent, respectively—are somewhat larger than those indicated 
nationally. But the planned 8 percent cut in soybean acreage is 
about the same as that in the nation. Although the nation's total 
crop output reached a new high last year, 1975 will not be 
remembered as the best of crop production years in the District. 
With weather-reduced yields per acre and the total acreage of all 
principal crops harvested about the same as in 1974, the only crops 
recording significant production gains over a year earlier were 
tobacco, soybeans, and sweet potatoes.
