       With the possible exception of inventory loans, business loan demand 
at commercial banks in the Tenth District has weakened recently. 
Real estate and personal loan demand remains strong, however. 
Mortgage commitments and savings inflows to savings and loan 
associations continue well above their year-ago pace. Department 
store sales, especially of household durables, are still advancing 
vigorously. Prices generally are perceived by marketing men and 
purchasing managers alike to be rising moderately (as one said, at a 
"manageable" pace), but recent performance of meat-animal prices 
bodes ill for retail meat prices in the near future. Overall, 
respondents were almost uniformly optimistic about the business 
situation for the rest of 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District bankers report little change in overall conditions of 
loan demand, with continued strength in real estate and personal 
loan categories partly offset by some signs of weakness in business 
loans. Strength in real estate loans appears broadly based, 
including both residential and commercial mortgage loans. Most 
bankers interviewed indicate installment lending is moderately 
strong and some report exceptional gains. Several Tenth District 
bankers single out credit card purchases as accounting for increased 
installment loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The recent weakness in business loans reported by most bankers 
interviewed is in contrast to the steady and strong growth in 
business lending in the Tenth District noted in the last three 
Redbooks. No clear pattern emerged in the reasons given for the 
decline; one Kansas City bank reports a large corporate customer has 
engaged in a public financing in order to reduce its bank 
indebtedness. Oklahoma banks, however, report strong business loan 
demand—for example, for expansion by oil drilling companies. 
Although overall district business loan demand appears to have 
weakened somewhat, several banks have recently experienced rising 
volumes of business loans to finance inventory accumulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings inflows to savings and loan associations in the Tenth 
District continue above those of a year ago, but appear somewhat 
smaller than earlier in 1972. Mortgage commitments remain generally 
strong, although some apprehension about possible overbuilding of 
multiunit structures was expressed by associations in Omaha, 
Oklahoma City, Topeka and Denver. Rates paid on savings are stable 
and rates charged on mortgages are generally reported as steady, 
though a tendency toward stiffening was noted by a Topeka 
correspondent and an Omaha firm suggested a slight softening there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stable or slowly rising prices since early this year were reported 
by a majority of purchasing managers surveyed. But more rapidly 
rising prices were noted by a manufacturer of construction-related 
products, a maker of electric cable and associated products and by a 
rubber-tire manufacturer (with reference to textiles and paper). 
Major retail establishments across the district report no sharp run-ups in their suppliers' prices, although increases are occurring. 
Some department stores report they are absorbing such price 
increases at the cost of a profit margin squeeze, but more indicate 
they are passing their cost increases on to customers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most purchasing managers interviewed indicate little if any 
significant change in the terms and conditions of the purchases they 
make. The only firms mentioning longer lead times were lumber and 
construction products firms and an electric cable manufacturer. One 
of these firms has increased inventories to compensate for extended 
lead time, but otherwise there were no inventory changes reported 
due to general economic conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store inventories appear to be behaving about as desired 
by retailers, with several respondents noting inventories were 
running as planned, or budgeted, for this year. In no instance were 
inventories reported to be lower than desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sales thus far in 1972 continue to be above those in the same period 
of 1971 in Tenth District department stores, with durable goods 
sales generally stronger than sales of nondurables. Nearly all sales 
categories showing special strength this spring were durables: 
building materials, furniture, major appliances and other home 
furnishings and bicycles and sporting goods. When areas of weakness 
in sales were mentioned, they generally were specific soft goods 
items. The major exception was men's apparel, an area of special 
sales strength in department stores in several district cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       After declining slightly more than 2 percent in March and April, 
farm prices rose 3 percent during the month ending May 15, mostly on 
the strength of higher meat-animal prices. Slaughter steers have 
since registered further price gains while hog prices have remained 
steady to weak. Seasonal factors, brisk demand and some tightening 
in pork supplies point to a firm price structure through the summer, 
after which meat-animal prices may ease off. Thus retail meat 
prices, after showing some stability during the last two months, 
likely will face strong upward pressures over the next few months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wheat producers in Oklahoma and southern Kansas are making good 
progress harvesting the new crop. Yields are running somewhat higher 
than expected, particularly in those areas of Oklahoma that 
sustained drought and frost damage earlier in the season. In Kansas, 
opinions on wheat prospects are mixed, but a growing feeling is that 
total production may approach the record 312 million bushels 
produced last year.
