      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In light of a series of negative economic indicators, some Tenth 
  District directors are expressing uncertainty about the strength of 
  the recovery. Concern about inflation is also widespread, but 
  inflationary pressures appear to be abating somewhat. The weakness 
  in prices for District agricultural products, however, especially 
  for cattle and wheat, has put many producers in a precarious 
  financial position. Loan demand at savings and loan institutions for 
  single-family houses remains strong, but business loan demand at 
  commercial banks has shown little sign of renewed strength.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nonbank directors surveyed expressed uncertainty over the strength 
  of the recovery. Although the likelihood of a slump was viewed as 
  slight, the recent collection of negative indicators has generated 
  uneasiness in certain management groups. One respondent suggested 
  that we might be experiencing a pre-election pause, with consumers 
  and businessmen holding off spending until a clearer picture of the 
  economic course that will be followed is available. Respondents 
  generally viewed their local economies as in good shape, with most 
  sectors up moderately. The situation in agriculture and ranching, 
  however, was said to be very grim, with cattlefeeders losing $100 to 
  $125 per head and some wheat farmers unwilling to sell their wheat 
  but also unable to borrow any more money on it.
     </p>
     <p>
      Inflation remains a major concern of several of the directors, who 
  expect the CPI to increase from 5 to 7 percent during 1977. Price 
  expectations reported by purchasing agents for several area 
  companies, however, were varied. A steel warehouse and service 
  center reported that most steel items are readily available, that it 
  is "definitely a buyer's market," and that there have been real 
  efforts at stimulating demand with price cuts from the mills. 
"Retail prices shouldn't go up significantly until something happens 
  at our end and I just don't see anything on the horizon to change 
  things," he noted. A lumber company reported that "prices have 
  leveled off at a high note" and will continue there unless demand 
  softens in the housing area. A major purchaser of paper goods 
  identified two different markets: that for coated paper (as in 
  brochures), which is strong, and that for uncoated paper, which is 
"soft." In the uncoated market, no more price increases are expected 
  this year and an 8 percent rise is expected for 1977. Coated paper, 
  however, may rise an additional 5 percent in 1976 and then 12 
  percent in 1977. Finally, a major purchaser of materials for 
  chemical containers expects another 5 to 6 percent tacked on to its 
  paper and steel purchases in the next few months.
     </p>
     <p>
      District bankers are expressing deep concern over the present state 
  of agricultural prices. The recent reduction in commodity prices, 
  while reflecting the typical bulge in farm marketings that occurs 
  during the fall harvest period, has put many producers in a 
  precarious financial position. In particular, cattle and wheat 
  producers have seen their hopes for higher prices vanish. As a 
  result, farmers have sharply increased their requests for renewals 
  and extensions on current obligations. Furthermore, wheat producers, 
  who purportedly will plant as much winter wheat this year as last 
  fall, are trying to line up financing for the new crop. Although 
  many rural banks have good liquidity and are actively seeking other 
  new loan accounts, there seems to be little enthusiasm for making 
  new loans on wheat in the current economic environment. It is
  likely, then, that some wheat farmers will be forced to sell their 
  grain at depressed prices to pay off loans that bankers may call. 
  Cattle producers can be expected to continue making adjustments in 
  herd sizes and feedlot placements. Others will no doubt try to wait 
  for a recovery in the market, and thus will seek alternative sources 
  of financing. The decline in wheat prices, combined with the less 
  lenient attitude of bankers in making or extending loans, is 
  provoking widespread support for higher government loan rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District commercial banks and savings and loans were surveyed 
  on the volume and composition of their recent construction loan 
  demand. Generally, the picture reported by the banks was not good, 
  with multifamily construction especially weak. The one bank that did 
  report some new multi-family demand was not lending due to the poor 
  quality of the projects. There was also little report of renewed 
  industrial loan activity. While some commercial borrowing for new, 
  small shopping centers was noted, major improvement was not expected 
  before early to mid-1977, and then mainly for commercial warehouses. 
  Only about half the respondents expected significant improvements in 
  multi-family construction in 1977 and little mention was made of 
  industrial construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan associations, on the other hand, reported excellent 
  single-family loan demand and continued strong savings inflows. 
  Conventional loan rates averaged about 9 percent with some mention 
  of softening to 8-3/4 percent. In general, those savings and loans 
  who made commercial loans stressed that they were very quality 
  conscious, but that "there was not a lot of quality stuff out 
  there." Some pickup in loans for small apartment houses and for 
  warehouses was mentioned. One Oklahoma respondent noted that 
  insurance companies were undercutting savings and loan rates in 
  attempting to attract borrowers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most bankers contacted for the October survey indicated that loan 
  demand had changed very little over the past month. Some reported an 
  increase in farm loans due mainly to operating loans to farmers and 
  ranchers who are withholding grain and cattle from the market. 
  Several bankers expressed disappointment that the new car models had 
  not yet increased consumer loan demand. Most of the banks contacted 
  have lowered their prime rate to 6-3/4 percent for their national 
  customers. Banks maintaining a local prime rate have reduced it 1/4 
  percent to 7-1/4 percent.
