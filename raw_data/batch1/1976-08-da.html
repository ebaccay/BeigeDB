      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      After slowing last spring, economic growth in the District appears 
  to be progressing at a slightly faster pace. The decline in total 
  employment may have ended, and home building and drilling activity 
  are strong. Manufacturing output, however, continues to sag. This 
  month's survey included banks, savings and loan associations, 
  mobile-home manufacturers and dealers, and natural gas producers. 
  Major city banks report slow growth in loan demand, but rural banks 
  indicate that demand for agricultural loans is strong. Mortgage 
  markets are tightening as demand for housing continues to grow. 
  Sales of mobile homes are up, but financing is unavailable for most 
  prospective buyers. The recent Federal Power Commission (FPC) order 
  to raise interstate gas prices is expected to bring increased 
  drilling, especially in offshore areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      The growth in loan demand at major District banks is lackluster, 
  although some bankers point to some recent improvements that may 
  lead to a significantly higher level of demand by the year-end. 
  Petroleum loans were reported to be strong, and several bankers 
  reported "a slight trend" toward inventory building. Reactions to 
  inquiries on consumer loan demand were mixed. Consumer installment 
  loans and use of credit cards range from record levels to "only 
  modest", and an increase in loan participations was reported by 
  member banks of multibank holding companies located in Houston.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agricultural bankers generally report demand for farm and ranch 
  credit is strong. Farm machinery loans have increased because of 
  higher prices for tractors, machinery, and equipment. And, as a 
  result of large grain harvests, crop storage loans have risen, but 
  loan demand for feeding cattle has weakened with fewer placements of 
  cattle on feed.
     </p>
     <p>
      A consensus of agricultural bankers in irrigated farming areas 
  indicates that the demand for crop-operating loans is up sharply, 
  largely due to increased costs. A banker in the Texas Panhandle 
  area, for example, reported that crop production costs were up 
  nearly a third from 1975 on most irrigated farm operations. High 
  natural gas prices have substantially increased the energy costs for 
  pumping water. In the intensive irrigation farming area around 
  Pecos, one banker indicated that natural gas prices paid by 
  producers are up 500 percent from a year earlier. And, coupled with 
  higher prices for other inputs, irrigation farming has become 
  expensive and risky. Bankers, therefore, are taking a close look at 
  the repayment capacity of irrigation farmers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Adequate funds, however, are available in the District for extending 
  agricultural credit. And half of the agricultural bankers are 
  seeking new farm and ranch loan accounts, even though loan demand 
  has risen. Rural banks also report a strong growth in deposits from 
  a year earlier.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for mortgage loans at savings and loan associations in major 
  District cities is strong, with one savings and loan association in 
  Houston describing the market as the biggest in history. Loan 
  applications for single-family homes priced from $40,000 to $50,000 
  are most numerous. In Houston, there is a strong market for town 
  houses, as renters are finding it cheaper to buy than to pay 
  escalating rents.
     </p>
     <p>
      There appears to be no oversupply of single-family homes. In 
  Houston, there is an acute shortage of improved building sites, and 
  skilled building tradesmen are in short supply. Part of the shortage 
  of lots is attributed to an average six-month delay of red tape 
  necessary to meet the Department of Housing and Urban Development's 
  (HUD's) standards in developing raw land.
     </p>
     <p>
      After slowing in the second quarter, the growth in savings deposits 
  expanded in July. One savings and loan association expected the rate 
  of inflow of savings to slow for the remainder of the year, however, 
  to about half the rate of growth experienced in the first half of 
  the year. The growth in savings is now largely due to purchases of 
  four-year 7 1/2 percent term certificates, followed by six-year 7 
  3/4 percent certificates and passbook accounts. Four months ago, 
  passbook accounts led the growth in savings deposits.
     </p>
     <div>
      A survey of mobile-home manufacturers and dealers indicated a
     </div>
     <p>
      "fantastic" demand for this type of housing. Sales are currently 
  being supported by people who cannot qualify to buy single-family 
  homes. The number of lenders has declined because many lost money on 
  the "easy" financing terms they offered a few years ago, and those 
  still in the market are much more selective in the loans they grant. 
  One manufacturer stated a buyer must be "gold plated" to be granted 
  a loan. According to one dealer in El Paso, sales could increase 
  1,000 percent if more financing were available. However, high 
  insurance costsâ€”as much as $80 per month for a $10,000 mobile homeâ€”have dampened sales in Gulf Coast areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Despite a court-issued stay of the FPC's recent order raising the 
  ceiling prices on natural gas sold in interstate markets, a number 
  of Texas gas producers expect the FPC to win a quick termination of 
  the stay, even if the case is appealed to the Supreme Court. Once 
  the new ceiling prices become effective, producers with contracts 
  that allow price adjustments will file for higher prices. Drilling 
  activity in the Districtâ€”already fairly strongâ€”should quicken, 
  especially in Federal offshore areas of the Gulf where the greatest 
  potential for significant new finds is believed to be. Idled deep-drilling rigs in west Texas should also benefit from higher prices. 
  Gas explorers say they will now look more closely at prospective 
  fields that were judged to be unprofitable at current interstate 
  price levels.
