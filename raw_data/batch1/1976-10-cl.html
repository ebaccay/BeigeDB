      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economists who met to discuss the economic outlook at the Federal 
  Reserve Bank of Cleveland on October 1 were optimistic that the 
  expansion would continue through 1977 and the rate of unemployment 
  would improve gradually. However, they forecast the rate of 
  inflation to step up somewhat from 1976. Capital spending is 
  forecast as a major source of strength in 1977, although no boom is 
  expected. Steel operations are not expected to pick up from recent 
  levels until next quarter. With few exceptions, there is no 
  indication of shortages nor are any expected at least through 1977, 
  unless the economy grows faster than the standard forecast 
  indicates. Upward price pressures remain strong.
     </p>
     <p>
      Twenty-eight economists who met at this Bank expect the expansion to 
  last through 1977. Not one of the group expects real GNP to decline 
  in any quarter next year. Forecasts of gains in real GNP for 1977 
  ranged from 4.5 percent to 6.5 percent, with a median of 5.1 
  percent. The group was not particularly concerned about relatively 
  sluggish performance in recent economic activity, nor did they point 
  to any excesses that might contribute to a slowdown in 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      The most optimistic of the group expect larger gains next year than 
  in 1976 in both consumer spending and capital spending to support an 
  increase in real GNP in 1977 of about 6 percent. In contrast, the 
  less optimistic expect gains in consumer spending next year to be 
  somewhat less than estimated for 1976. New car sales, for example, 
  are expected to rise nearly 8 percent, following a 20 percent gain 
  in 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      &gt;The economists are counting heavily on capital spending as a major 
  source of strength in 1977. Even the least optimistic expect gains 
  in nonresidential fixed investment of about 13 percent from 1976, 
  with the median at 16 percent. According to an economist associated 
  with a large machine tool builder, the current mild recovery in 
  capital spending reflects the fact that the drop during the latest 
  recession was neither as severe nor as long as some other 
  contractions in spending since World War II. His firm's orders for 
  machine tools rose sharply in the last two months, continuing a V-shaped recovery from depressed levels in early 1975. Orders from 
  automotive producers account for much of the recent spurt. Another 
  economist with a major capital goods producer reported that demand 
  for some types of capital goods, including motors and generators, 
  has rebounded sharply in recent months, but that demand from 
  electric utilities and for new plant construction remains weak. 
  According to his estimates, real spending by the electric utility 
  industry for generating capacity is unlikely to match 1970-1971 
  expenditures until the early 1980's, because an estimated 35 percent 
  of the industries' capacity is idle, and because long-range 
  projections of electric power consumption have been scaled down. 
  Plant expansion also is being dampened by environmental regulations 
  that lengthen lead times and by high costs that hold the return on 
  investment on new plants lower than for existing facilities. His 
  firm has no plans for new plant construction but will accelerate 
  spending for modernization and replacement in 1977. A bank economist 
  estimates there should be ample funds to finance capital spending, 
  reflecting further improvement in corporate cash flow and new 
  sources of lending by life insurance companies and foreign banks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel economists have scaled down their estimates of steel shipments 
  and production for this quarter but expect production next year will 
  be about 10 percent higher than in 1976. They are depending on 
  acceleration in capital spending and some inventory building to 
  boost production. Industry plans to add upward of 20 million tons of 
  capacity over the next few years are apparently being held in 
  abeyance because of environmental regulations, high costs of new 
  plants, lower return of new investment, and inadequate prices to 
  finance new plants. One economist expressed the view that the spot 
  shortages that might surface in 1977 can apparently be accommodated 
  with foreign steel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Various industry sources indicate they do not expect shortages to 
  reappear in 1977. One economist reported that projected gains in 
  real GNP of 4 to 5 percent for 1977 do not imply bottlenecks in 
  supplies, although some spot problems may surface, especially for 
  some chemicals. Utilization of capacity in materials-producing 
  industries is projected to increase to about 86 percent by year-end 
  1977, compared with 80 percent last quarter and a high of 93 percent 
  in 1973. If the economy were to expand at a 6 percent or higher rate 
  in 1977, bottlenecks might appear in some other industries, 
  including steel, aluminum, and paper. A financial officer with a 
  petrochemical firm confirmed tightening in demand for some 
  chemicals. Demand for flat-rolled steel products, which were 
  informally allocated by some steel producers last spring, fell 
  sharply during summer months, and these products are no longer 
  considered in tight supply. Production in the steel industry, which 
  fell to about 80 percent of capacity last month, continued to ease 
  in early October.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is little evidence of relaxation in upward price pressures. 
  Preliminary results from a limited sample of this Bank' s monthly 
  survey of manufacturers show nearly 70 percent of respondents expect 
  price increases in October, as was the case during the summer 
  months. Need for higher prices to finance high costs of new plants, 
  a continued rise in energy costs, and management worry over some 
  type of wage-price guidelines seem to be the most frequently cited 
  reasons. An executive with a fastener producer noted weak demand and 
  heavy imports have prevented a price increase since August 1974, but 
  his company hopes to raise prices for some lines late this year or 
  early next year. One steel source expects that the industry will 
  again seek to raise prices for sheet steel in December or January as 
  consumer inventories are brought down to desired levels. He noted 
  that although scrap prices have declined substantially in recent 
  months, prices of iron-ore, transportation, natural gas, and oil 
  continue upward.
