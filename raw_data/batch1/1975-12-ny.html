      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 10, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending, notwithstanding its sluggishness in recent 
months, is expected to provide the principal near-term stimulus to 
the economy, according to the views expressed recently by Second 
District directors and other business leaders. Business capital 
spending remains lethargic, although a number of respondents felt 
the longer-term need for such outlays might well be building up. The 
respondents on balance looked for a continued modest improvement in 
residential construction. Loan demand was generally characterized as 
weak.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retail trade industry continues to provide the brightest element 
in the economic outlook. The president of a large nationwide chain 
of department stores thus characterized the outlook for the 
Christmas buying season as "glowing." He reported that after a slow 
start in November, which he attributed to unfavorable weather 
conditions rather than to a lack of consumer confidence, nationwide 
retail sales had risen sharply in the recent past and that he was 
"very" optimistic regarding the prospects for the post-Christmas 
season. He stated that while retail sales in New York City were not 
doing as well as nationally, he felt that even there the outlook was 
relatively favorable. A survey by a local newspaper indicated that 
November sales by large New York City department stores were only 
3.5 percent higher than during the comparable period a year ago, 
with merchants attributing this relatively poor performance to the 
adverse effect of the threat of a City default, the 11-percent 
unemployment rate in the City, the City's generally troubled 
economic conditions, as well as unseasonably warm weather through 
much of November. Sales by the suburban branches of these same 
stores, however, were substantially higher; and the combined sales 
of these stores and their branches were nearly 7 percent higher than 
in November 1974. The chairman of the City's largest department 
store reported that his firm's sales in the metropolitan area 
remained "strong" and was generally optimistic regarding the outlook 
over the coming months. New York City apparel manufacturers, 
moreover, reported a strong pickup in orders, associated not only 
with the Christmas season but also with the spring and Easter 
season. Observers reported the outlook for the Christmas buying 
season in Western New York to be favorable, citing a "healthy" 
consumer attitude toward spending, adequate savings, and an increase 
in real disposable income as contributing to this favorable outlook. 
One exception was the Buffalo area, where a retailer reported sales 
trends to be "spotty" and the outlook "not encouraging."
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding business capital spending, most respondents saw little 
evidence of a near-term pickup in that sector. Among others, the 
chairman of a multinational oil firm stated he had not noticed any 
change in the conservative attitude toward plant and equipment 
outlays in the petroleum industry, and the president of a nationwide 
retail firm reported that, in general, retailers continued to act 
cautiously toward the opening of new branches or the expansion of 
existing facilities. The president of a multinational nonferrous 
metal concern indicated that his firm's customers were planning only 
the absolutely essential capital expenditures. He felt that 
businessmen's generally conservative spending intentions were linked 
to the uncertainties surrounding the 1976 economic outlook and the 
vigor of the current recovery. Several respondents, however, 
indicated that underlying pressures for capital outlays might be 
building up. A senior official of a large paper firm thus stated 
that he placed "little faith" in official capacity utilization data, 
which he felt incorporated a great deal of obsolete facilities. 
Moreover, he noted that over the coming years the paper industry 
would be obliged to invest $1 billion or more to meet the 
requirements of the Environmental Protection Act. Several other 
respondents, including senior officials of utilities, metal 
container manufacturing, and chemical firms, expressed concern over 
the magnitude of the outlays their firms and industries would have 
to undertake to comply with this Act. The chairman of a large New 
York State utility thus stated that while there might not be an 
immediate demand for capital expenditures in the public utilities 
sector, the eventual expenditures for environmental control facing 
the industry were a "real sleeper." A number of respondents also 
expressed concern over the high and rising cost of replacing 
existing facilities, and the adverse impact of this development on 
their firms' cash-flow positions.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to residential construction, several respondents viewed 
immediate prospects as relatively poor, or only slightly improved, 
reflecting the high cost of construction and maintenance, the 
continued availability of existing houses and apartments, and the 
uncertainties regarding the economic outlook. The president of a 
manufacturing firm, however, expected further moderate gains in 
single-family home construction and a "considerable" comeback of 
apartment buildings over the next 15 months. And a senior official 
of a thrift institution in a resort area reported that construction 
activities in his area had picked up in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding loan demand, loan officers at large banks in general 
reported a weaker demand than they had anticipated late last summer 
and did not look for any significant pick-up over the near term. The 
Buffalo branch directors characterized the current and prospective 
state of loan demand as "stagnant" and unlikely to improve 
significantly until mid-1976 at the earliest. The president of a 
retail firm, however, expected loan demand in the retail industry to 
increase as retailers rebuilt inventories. Similarly, the president 
of a nonferrous metal firm felt that corporate loan demand has begun 
to show signs of reviving as inventory accumulation and capital 
outlays in certain sectors recover.
