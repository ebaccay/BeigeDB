      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although bank directors in early August were generally favorable 
  about the District's economy, other sources indicated some concern 
  about the economy's performance. Many directors were optimistic 
  about consumer spending for their areas, and District retail sales 
  held up quite well, but an actual resurgence in consumer spending 
  had not occurred. Also, our latest agricultural credit conditions 
  survey indicated a weakening in farm earnings and a cutback in farm 
  spending. Several directors reported a considerable amount of 
  residential construction in their areas. Apartment construction and 
  nonresidential construction, however, were not strong throughout the 
  District. Looking toward fall, directors looked for economic 
  policies—particularly those regarding agriculture—to play an 
  important role in the Presidential campaign.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although many directors reported favorable retail sales gains in 
  recent weeks and were encouraged about the future, other information 
  indicated that no resurgence in consumer spending had taken place. A 
  director whose firm is a major producer of consumer goods stated 
  that food and soft goods sales revived in June and July and expected 
  business to be good this fall. Economists for two major retailers 
  headquartered in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area were not so 
  optimistic. They reported that, since their firms' sales had yet to 
  revive, their outlook for the second half of this year was 
  weakening. One economist said that he had not made a downward 
  revision of his sales forecasts for the last half of 1976 but had 
  less confidence in them than earlier. The other stated that his firm 
  had forecast a 10 percent sales increase for the second half of 1976 
  but was currently anticipating only a 5 to 6 percent gain. And both 
  firms adopted a more cautious position on inventories than they had 
  earlier this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The results of our latest agricultural credit conditions survey, 
  taken in late July, indicated that weakened farm earnings had tended 
  to dampen agricultural spending. Many agricultural bankers appraised 
  farm earnings as being somewhat worse in July than they had reported 
  in April, and 51 percent of those surveyed reported recent farm 
  earnings lower than a year before. In assessing the prospects for 
  the next three months, bankers were slightly more pessimistic—55 
  percent expected lower farm earnings than last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The present crimp on earnings seems to stem largely from low grain 
  prices, the continued withholding of 1975 crops from the market, and 
  unprofitable cattle operations. Expectations that earnings could 
  worsen have been generated by inadequate rainfall in much of the 
  District's crop regions.
     </p>
     <p>
      As might be expected from their assessment of farm earnings, 
  agricultural bankers reported cutbacks in spending by farmers. 
  Forty-one percent of the bankers responded that recent spending was 
  lower than at the same time last year, and 48 percent expected 
  spending in the coming three months to continue lower than a year 
  before. These figures are substantial revisions of their responses 
  in April, when only 31 percent reported low spending and 25 percent 
  expected more low spending for the next quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most directors reported quite strong residential construction 
  activity but mostly in just the single-family market. A director 
  whose firm is a major producer of temperature controls cited 
  information indicating that single-family construction was much 
  stronger in the Ninth District than in the nation. He expected that 
  strength to increase in the third quarter. With regard to apartment 
  building, he mentioned a national association of home builders 
  survey, which found a rather sharp second-quarter recovery in 
  multifamily construction that was expected to gain momentum during 
  the remainder of 1976 and into 1977. Also, a recent Twin Cities 
  metropolitan area apartment survey reported that vacancy rates had 
  declined to quite a low level, a usual sign that a pickup is due. 
  However, many observers felt that rental rates were not high enough 
  to justify new apartment construction in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from directors on building activity in their respective 
  areas showed nonresidential construction weaker than residential 
  construction. However, the director whose firm manufactures 
  temperature controls believed nonresidential construction had begun 
  to recover and should be very strong by 1977, up 10 to 15 percent in 
  constant terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors agreed that economic policies would be a major part in 
  this year's Presidential campaign. One director thought that 
  policies regarding inflation would be important to either side 
  because of the apparent voter concern in that area. Another 
  expressed concern that spending promises made during the campaign 
  could generate inflationary expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      A matter of concern to many directors is the particular role of 
  agricultural policies in this year's campaign. A Montana director 
  said that recent supply and demand conditions point toward a 
  weakening in wheat prices—a weakening which would benefit the 
  Democrat's argument for reimposition of price supports. That 
  director also expected criticism of the Ford Administration for 
  imposing agricultural export embargoes which are associated with 
  falling prices.
