      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 13, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Deceleration occurred in the stronger sectors of the Southeast's 
  economy, but the lost momentum is considered temporary. The outlook 
  for moderate prices of lumber and wood products has become more 
  favorable. However, curtailment of natural gas supplies and 
  increased rates for natural gas and electricity are creating upward 
  price pressures. Retail sales, with the exception of new 
  automobiles, flattened in August and September. Tourist traffic, 
  although still strong in some areas, has also been disappointing. 
  Offsetting these weaknesses, some improvement has occurred in 
  portions of the construction and real estate sector. Diverse 
  indicators of general business conditions, on balance, suggest an 
  uptrend in economic activity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several developments affecting the outlook for prices have been 
  reported by directors. Demand for lumber has decreased by more than 
  normal for the season and prices have declined. Concern has been 
  expressed in previous reports about the effect on prices of lumber 
  and wood products of legislation restricting clear-cutting in 
  national forests. Prospects now appear good that Congress will 
  produce "an acceptable piece of legislation."
     </p>
     <p>
      Several energy-related developments also have potential price 
  effects. Electrical utilities are pressing for sizable rate 
  increases. The recent action by the Federal Power Commission raising 
  the wellhead price for natural gas takes effect in Tennessee during 
  late October. Customer rates will increase from 17 to 21 percent. 
  Nevertheless, curtailments of gas supplies to industrial users are 
  expected to amount to 24 percent of requirements. These curtailments 
  will necessitate substitution of alternative fuels such as propane 
  and liquefied natural gas which are much more expensive and more 
  hazardous to handle. Furthermore, delivery problems resulting from 
  limited railway tank car and barge capacity may complicate the 
  problem of obtaining adequate, reliable supplies. Finally, the 
  Tennessee Valley Authority is investigating new methods of burning 
  high-sulfur coal in steam-powered generating plants. This research 
  may permit Tennessee to rely more heavily on coal deposits located 
  within the state.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the retail level, department stores are expected to emphasize 
  seasonal promotions during October in an effort to boost lagging 
  sales increases; price concessions are anticipated. Sales of new car 
  models are proceeding without any evidence of resistance to the 
  higher prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within the construction and real estate sector, some further 
  brightening is occurring in Southeastern condominium markets. 
  Several reports have been received that unfinished, apparently 
  abandoned projects have been revived, completed, and placed on the 
  market. In the Atlanta area, units in such projects have been sold 
  at public auction. Some unsold projects are being rented. But, 
  despite the declining overhang of unsold units, the condominium 
  market remains soft in Florida, Tennessee, and the Atlanta area.
     </p>
     <p>
      "No-frills" housing is being constructed in parts of the District. 
  In west Florida, substantial numbers of standardized, inexpensive 
  units have been built. This approach has also been followed in 
  Alabama but has not been well received. Apartment construction is 
  becoming increasingly attractive in several areas. Occupancy rates 
  are rising in parts of Alabama and Tennessee. New construction is 
  beginning or is receiving serious consideration. But, in central 
  Florida, the only effect of increased occupancy has been to end a 
  price war.
     </p>
     <p>
      Renewed interest has also developed in warehouse and shopping center 
  construction. A permit for foundation work has been issued in 
  Mississippi for a large regional shopping mall; plans for additional 
  commercial construction projects have been submitted for approval in 
  several Alabama cities. Government construction remains a strong 
  point, with a new state capitol building under construction in 
  Florida, and planning is under way for a new convention center and 
  hotel complex in Orlando, Florida. In Louisiana, the Red River 
  Navigation Project is receiving annual funding of about $100 
  million.
     </p>
     <p>
      Unfortunately, the improved outlook in real estate and construction 
  is offset by some weaknesses in retail sales and tourism. Although 
  sales of new automobile models appear to be consistently strong, 
  according to initial reports, general merchandise retailers indicate 
  that sales flattened or became sluggish in September. However, 
  according to most reports, retailers retain highly positive 
  expectations for the upcoming holiday season. Inventories appear to 
  be well in line. However, many retailers are stressing seasonal 
  promotions in an effort to stimulate sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      In view of these mixed results, a report from a Florida boat 
  manufacturer is informative. A 25 percent increase in sales volume 
  compared to last year is attributed to higher unit cost as much as 
  to higher unit volume. Larger and higher quality units are being 
  purchased, while less expensive units are difficult to sell. This 
  observation is consistent with recent findings of a disparity in 
  consumer confidence between higher income consumers and low- to 
  moderate-income individuals.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist activity presents a varied impression. A south Florida 
  director feels that Miami is increasingly by-passed by tourists in 
  favor of central Florida and the Caribbean. Occupancy rates in Miami 
  are down. Some softness is also apparent in central Florida, 
  although certain attractions continue to record gains. Northeastern 
  Florida tourism has turned up again after a period of declines. 
  Tourist traffic is at record levels in Tennessee, both at Opryland 
  and in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park.
     </p>
     <p>
      Finally, an array of indicators of general business conditions 
  appeared in this month's directors' reports. In Alabama, sales of 
  energy-saving building products such as double-paned windows have 
  risen. In addition, engine and stand-by generator sales are strong, 
  reflecting increases in public construction projects such as 
  hospitals. Mining equipment sales are also good. However, declining 
  sales of lift trucks are interpreted as a reflection of a general 
  slowing of the economy as a consequence of their widespread usage. 
  Cargo transported into Florida by trucks has risen 21 percent, year 
  to date, reaching its highest point since late 1973. Truck leasing 
  and rental, after a steady 20-month decline, have risen rapidly in 
  the last 60 days. The reversal is regarded as evidence that 
  consumption is increasing, necessitating increased shipments to 
  maintain a steady flow of goods. Increased truck usage by firms 
  engaged in building trades, redistribution of wholesale hard goods, 
  and fertilizer and chemicals is noted. Increasing TVA power sales to 
  industry, following a lengthy decline, indicate increasing 
  industrial activity in Tennessee.
