      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The November survey of Fifth District business conditions shows 
improvement in many areas of activity. Manufacturers report 
increases in shipments, orders, and backlogs, while inventories 
continue to decline across a broad range. Overall, inventories 
appear to have been brought into line with desired levels, but there 
remain firms and industries which view current levels as excessive. 
In manufacturing, the number of employees and the length of the 
workweek are up from the previous month, and increases in average 
hourly earnings are widespread. Some upward price pressures continue 
in evidence. Over one-third of the manufacturers surveyed view 
current plant and equipment capacity as excessive, but there 
continues to be little interest in revising current expansion plans. 
Retailers surveyed report sales improved substantially and sales of 
big-ticket items relative to total sales increased for the first 
time in well over a year. The district's farm income has improved 
further, gaining 2 percent over a year earlier for the January to 
August period. At Fifth District banks, business and consumer 
lending grew moderately in October but real estate lending leveled 
off. Investments have declined, and bank credit has shown little 
change.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Of manufacturers participating in the November survey, over 50 
percent report increased shipments during the month and nearly as 
many show increases in new orders. Backlogs appear to have increased 
slightly; inventories of both finished goods and materials have 
declined further. Compared with earlier surveys, fewer firms are now 
reporting reduced materials inventories and more are reporting 
reductions in finished goods. The diffusion of survey responses 
suggests that inventories have been brought into line with desired 
levels, although only about one-half of all respondents view current 
levels as satisfactory. The remaining one-half are almost evenly 
divided between those who view current inventory levels as excessive 
and those who view them as inadequate. Textile mills surveyed 
generally view inventories as being in excess, while apparel 
manufacturers hold the opposite view. Furniture and chemical 
manufacturers feel current levels are about right, while in the 
machinery and equipment industry responses vary from firm to firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Survey responses of manufacturers further suggest some increase in 
employment and a lengthening of the workweek since the last survey. 
Nearly one-third of the respondents report increases in these areas. 
Employee compensation and prices paid continue to move generally 
upward, joined this month by prices received. Over 35 percent of 
manufacturers continue to view current plant and equipment capacity 
as excessive, but there is still no strong sentiment for altering 
current expansion plans. Seventy percent of manufacturers, a higher 
percentage than last month, expect the level of business activity 
nationally to improve during the next six months, while half of them 
foresee improvement in the level of production in their respective 
firms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The November survey of district retailers shows a strong upward 
movement in sales and the first relative increase in sales of big-ticket items in well over a year. Inventories at the retail level 
apparently have increased somewhat, but three-fourths of the 
responses indicate that current levels are about right. Despite 
little change in employment, over 85 percent of the retailers report 
increases in employee compensation. Prices, received and paid, are 
generally up over the previous month. Survey responses further 
indicate a basically optimistic feeling about the outlook for the 
next six months, as almost two-thirds of those surveyed expect 
improvement nationally, locally, and in their own firms over that 
period.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the banking sector, business loans outstanding for weekly 
reporting banks have increased moderately compared to the past 
several months but currently stand 7 percent below last year's 
level. What strength exists is centered in seasonally strong 
industries, especially retail trade and the food processing and 
tobacco areas. Loans to public utilities, however, have also 
experienced a recent spate of activity. Consumer lending continues 
to increase at a sluggish but steady pace. Total investments of 
weekly reporting banks declined by 1 percent from September to 
October but are still 15 percent above year-ago levels. Holdings of 
treasury bills have increased, but those of longer-term U.S. 
government securities have declined. Savings deposit flows have 
picked up after falling off in September. CD attrition has stopped, 
even though rates offered by district banks have not increased 
appreciably in recent weeks. Borrowings from the Fed by member banks 
have declined to their lowest level since June. Net federal funds 
purchases have remained about level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Farm income for the first eight months gained 2 percent over a year 
ago. This increase contrasts with a 4 percent decline nationally. 
This season's flue-cured tobacco prices have continued to average 5 
percent below a year ago, but marketings have picked up sharply in 
recent weeks and are now running a little ahead of last year. The 
value of gross sales has therefore risen significantly but is still 
around 2 percent, or some $27 million, under a year earlier.
