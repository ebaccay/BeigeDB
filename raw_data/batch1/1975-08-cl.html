      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 13, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from directors, financial officers, and economists suggest 
an end to the recession and a beginning of recovery. Output in 
consumer goods industries, retail sales, and residential 
construction have strengthened further from lows last spring, and 
nonresidential construction contracts apparently reached bottom 
earlier in the spring. Unemployment in the District peaked in March, 
but little improvement has occurred since then. Steel and capital 
goods industries remain weak. Upward price pressures appear to be 
more widespread than in several months.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Conversation with manufacturers point out a dichotomy between 
producers of consumer goods and producers of business and industrial 
equipment. Production and shipments of consumer goods generally have 
been recovering, as the worst of inventory reduction has been 
completed. An economist for a tire producer reports that business 
reached a trough around January-February and that output has been 
rising since then. In the case of passenger tires, the shape of the 
recovery has been nearly a "V", as production has been increased in 
line with sales. A supplier of glass to the auto industry and an 
executive with a fastener firm also reported that orders and 
production have picked up in recent weeks. A financial officer with 
a household appliance maker reports a turnaround in sales of vacuum 
cleaners, although another producer reported plans to continue to 
cut stocks of electric and gas ranges in addition to the 25 percent 
reduction since last December. According to an economist with a 
leading producer of soap, detergents, and household products, sales 
in recent weeks have risen above year-earlier figures for the first 
time this year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical and plastic producers in the District also report a rather 
sharp recovery, owing to drastic liquidation of stocks in recent 
months. A major producer of plastics stated that operations last 
month soared to 75 percent of capacity from the 50 percent rate in 
May. A petrochemical producer reports that operations have picked up 
to about 70 percent of capacity, compared with 50 to 60 percent 
during the trough in January-February. Steel and capital goods 
producers continue to report weak or declining trends in orders, 
although steel orders in July were probably at the low for the year, 
according to steel economists. For one firm, orders for August 
delivery are slightly better than for a comparable period in July, 
and orders for September are stronger than for August. One economist 
estimates that liquidation of steel will be about as severe this 
quarter as last, while another estimates that the bulk of the 
liquidation occurred last quarter. A financial officer with a major 
aluminum producer reports that orders and production have been 
rising slowly since the March low. Several capital goods producers 
and suppliers report weak and declining order activity. A chief 
financial officer with a firm that produces farm machinery reports 
easing in activity, while sales of heavy trucks picked up in recent 
weeks from dismal levels earlier in the year. Sales of truck tires 
remain weak, and no pickup is expected until the fourth quarter. A 
major roller-bearing firm reports that orders from farm implement 
producers and freight car manufacturers turned down, and a director 
with a gear firm reports orders receded from advanced levels last 
year.
      </p>
      <p>
       In general, financial officers and economists contacted do not 
expect shortages of materials or capacity to hamper early stages of 
recovery. Two directors, however, fear that capacity shortages will 
retard a recovery in their industries because long depreciation 
schedules hold down replacement and modernization of obsolescent 
facilities. Our contacts in the steel, aluminum, coal, chemicals, 
and rubber industries indicated there is ample room for expansion of 
output before approaching peak capacity operations that would cause 
bottlenecks and shortages of supplies. An economist with a steel 
producer reported operations were no more than 60 percent of 
capacity, an aluminum producer reports present utilization of 74 
percent, and two chemical producers are operating in a range of 70 
to 75 percent, all of which are well below the peak rates of 1974. 
Moreover, none expect recovery in their industries to be much higher 
than 80 to 85 percent by the end of 1976.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shortages in natural gas supplies represent a potential obstacle to 
recovery in steel and other industries dependent on this energy 
source. Three steel economists report that curtailed supplies of gasâ€”as little as 40 percent of normal usage beginning Novemberâ€”would impede a recovery in steel. One major steel producer said 
limited supplies would force shutting their plants one week each 
month during this winter and that his firm is beginning to stockpile 
propane as an alternative energy source. Another has begun to 
stockpile gas supplies and is also drilling wells in northeast Ohio 
in areas close to steel-producing locations. A third producer will 
attempt to substitute oil for natural gas if allocations are as 
severe as now indicated. A large forging producer in northern Ohio 
plans to drill forty wells for his own use rather than convert to 
oil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment in the District has not yet shown any improvement from 
the latest low in March. Nonmanufacturing employment has risen 
gradually in recent months, but employment in durable goods 
industries, especially steel, is still weakening. There are only 
isolated cases of recalls among firms contacted, mainly related to 
consumer goods industries. A producer of household goods is 
recalling 400 workers, and a producer of flat glass for automotive 
is recalling 145 workers. For most firms that have reported a 
recovery under way, employment has stabilized, and no plans for 
large-scale recalls are in prospect until sustained improvement is 
experienced. Steel firms continue to lay off workers, and one large 
producer furloughed 1,000 workers on August 1.
      </p>
      <p>
       Upward price pressures have surfaced, especially in those industries 
where recovery has been under way. Several directors expect that the 
rate of inflation will accelerate. One fears "roaring inflation" 
will slow a recovery, and another expects resumption of double-digit 
inflation in 1976. A small producer of copper products raised prices 
2 to 3 cents per pound, and a major producer of aluminum raised 
prices 2 cents per pound to offset labor and materials cost 
increases that occurred when their markets were weaker. An economist 
with a coal company remarked that coal prices are likely to increase 
later this year or early next year as demand strengthens. A steel 
economist justified the publicized increases on steel because of 
higher prices for materials (ore, nickel, chrome) and labor costs; 
he expects competitive forces will hold the overall increase down to 
4-5 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential construction contracts continued to recover in June. 
Deposit inflows to savings and loan associations slowed somewhat 
more than seasonal in July, while mortgage loans closed rose to the 
best level for any month in the past two years, according to a 
financial economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. An 
executive with a savings and loan association reports a slower 
growth in deposits, coupled with strengthening in commitments, will 
sharply reduce their liquidity by the end of August and may result 
in some need for borrowing. Another official reported an unusually 
good volume of deposits occurred in July and August, with the bulk 
in certificates. Mortgage rates in the Cleveland area rose about 1/4 
percentage point and averaged about 9 percent for an 80 percent 
loan.
