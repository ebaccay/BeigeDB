     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Minneapolis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Ninth District employers apparently are continuing to feel the 
effects of weak economic conditions, and are still paring work 
forces and reducing production schedules. Results of our latest 
quarterly industrial expectations survey reveal that District 
manufacturers are not anticipating any significant sales increases 
over the next six to nine months. Consumer spending, for the most 
part, is still weak, although some directors felt that retail sales 
were picking up in their areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area employers apparently are still in the process of reducing their 
work forces and adjusting their work schedules. The largest layoff 
over the last month occurred at Honeywell, Incorporated, where an 
additional 341 workers were separated because of a continuing 
reduction in defense spending. Seventy-five workers were laid off by 
a
      <br/>
      film-processing manufacturer in the twin cities, and a furniture 
and flooring manufacturer in upper Michigan furloughed forty-five 
workers because of a lack of orders, reportedly because of the 
slowdown in school construction. In addition, directors and officers 
of the Bank felt that overtime work for the most part was 
nonexistent and were either aware or had heard of cases where 
employers had reduced work-weeks to less than five days. A local 
professional engineering society reported that 10 percent of the 
engineers in the twin cities were out of work.
     </p>
     <p>
      These further cutbacks in employment are consistent with District 
manufacturers' expectations regarding their sales. According to the 
results of our latest industrial expectations survey, taken during 
the first two weeks of November, area manufacturers have revised 
downward their sales expectations during this quarter and the first 
quarter of next year. Following a year-to-year sales decline of 3.7 
percent during the third quarter, their sales in the fourth quarter 
to be about 1.3 percent below a year ago. This is the first time in 
13 surveys that District manufacturing sales have shown a year-to-year decline and is the first time that District manufacturers were 
anticipating lower sales than a year earlier. On the brighter side,
District manufacturers expect their sales in the first quarter of 
1971 to be up 1.3 percent above a year earlier and then to exceed 
the year-earlier level by 4.2 percent in the second quarter. 
Although these sales gains imply no significant recovery in District 
manufacturing activity, this is the first time in a year that 
manufacturers expect their sales to strengthen, even weakly, over 
the forecast period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Also on the brighter side, one of our directors who attended a 
conference sponsored by the First National Bank of Chicago stated 
that bankers are generally optimistic regarding business conditions 
in 1971. According to him, only 10 percent of the 1,100 bankers from 
all over the country who attended the conference felt that business 
would weaken further next year. Of those attending the conference, 
45 percent felt that interest rates would decline during 1971.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumers are still watching their expenditures very closely, but 
there are some scattered indications that consumer buying may be 
strengthening. Directors from Michigan, Wisconsin, and Montana for 
the most part felt that Christmas buying was up from a year ago, and 
one director noted that traffic has been extremely heavy. On the 
other hand, one Twin Cities director felt that consumer buying 
attitudes had not changed in the past month or so and that consumer 
spending was still very sluggish. Retail sales during the 
Thanksgiving weekend, which are usually taken as an indicator of the 
Christmas sales season, were described as "very disheartening" by 
one major Minneapolis retailer, and many retailers in Minneapolis-St. Paul feel that consumers will remain cautious throughout this 
buying season. A director from South Dakota felt that consumer 
buying attitudes are still very conservative. This relative 
pessimism was reflected in lower sales for both soft goods and 
durables and has been chiefly caused by the recent large decline in 
livestock prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors of this Bank feel that District state and local 
government construction expenditures next year will not differ 
markedly from this year. Local legislators, however, have not yet 
formulated their plans. A few directors were able to cite specific 
large planned expenditures, but most commented that communities in 
their areas apparently were not planning major construction 
improvements. In some cases, public facilities were already adequate 
while, in others local legislators either are reluctant to impose 
higher taxes to finance the construction of public facilities or 
have been turned down by the voters in recent bond issue requests. 
Primarily in Montana, they are stymied by statutory ceiling rates 
that they can pay for borrowed money.
