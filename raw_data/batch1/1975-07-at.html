      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      "Improving" seems to be the key word in most sectors of the Sixth 
District economy. The agricultural outlook is bright with bumper 
crops expected. Car sales are showing some moderate strength in 
parts of the District. Inventories now seem to be at desired levels 
for most businesses, except primary metals manufacturing. 
Construction of single-family homes is improving; new defense 
contracts will also aid construction activity. Several District 
businesses are negotiating sizable contracts with Middle East oil 
companies. Tourist activity throughout the region continues to be 
strong.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Bumper crops are expected in many parts of the District. In Alabama, 
  farmers are making good progress in planting and cultivating. Most 
  crops, especially tomatoes, are very good. Florida's tomato crop is 
  also very good this year, and prices are at high levels. However, in 
  Louisiana, heavy rains and backwater flooding this spring have 
  caused considerable damage to timber and pasturelands. Loss 
  estimates run as high as $50 million. Tennessee crops are generally 
  excellent, but there is concern over the current lack of moisture in 
  this area. The high level of production costs continues to affect 
  District farming. One report from an eastern Tennessee county 
  indicates that the number of farm auctions has risen to between 
  three and five per week.
     </p>
     <p>
      New car sales, while improving, fail to show any substantial 
  rebound. Reports from Alabama, Florida, and Louisiana, however, 
  indicate that used cars are selling very well. Foreign car sales are 
  also brisk. The Jacksonville Port Authority reports foreign car 
  imports continuing at a rapid rate. New car sales are reported as 
  spotty in Tennessee. However, in Nashville, a Cadillac dealer sold 
  25 cars in 7 days; he reports that May was his third best month 
  since he has been in business. Used cars are reportedly selling at a 
  fantastic rate in the Nashville, Tennessee, area.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tennessee informants report that retail sales of both high-priced 
  and low-priced items are doing well. The slack seems to be in the 
  middle-priced items. Several Tennessee manufacturers report orders 
  up and are now rehiring. However, farm machinery, glass, and 
  industrial lighting manufacturers continue to cut back their work 
  forces because orders remain at low levels and inventories are still 
  excessive. Most retail stores appear to have inventories back to 
  normal levels but remain conservative in restocking because of 
  uncertainties over the strength in retail sales. One director voiced 
  apprehension over the impact on retail sales of the expiration of 
  unemployment compensation benefits later this fall.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors were asked to make a special survey of inventory 
  conditions of local businesses. For the most part, businesses now 
  say that inventories are at desired levels and no further reductions 
  are anticipated. Some believe that inventories are too low. However, 
  steel manufacturers' inventories are cited as being too high. No 
  expectations of renewed materials shortages in the near future were 
  voiced by the directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposit inflows at savings and loan institutions continue to 
  accelerate in most parts of the District. More importantly, mortgage 
  commitments are now on the rise. Most parts of Alabama report 
  substantial gains in building permits, and real estate dealers 
  report continued increases in sales of current housing inventories. 
  For the first time in over a year, there appears to be a definite 
  upturn in single-family housing activity on the lower western coast 
  of Florida. Several Government defense contracts will also give a 
  boost to construction activity. Government funds of over $66 million 
  are expected to be approved for housing construction projects at 
  Georgia's Fort Stewart complex. Louisiana's Fort Polk is to receive 
  over $100 million for permanent housing; the funds have already been 
  approved by the U.S. Armed Services Committee. As strange as it 
  seems, Florida's housing industry may receive a boost from Middle 
  East oil countries. Deltona's "component homes" plant in South 
  Florida is now closed down, and this has added to the region's 
  unemployment. This company is now working on a new home line for 
  overseas shipment to the Middle East. If the project materializes, 
  the plant will soon reopen. An Alabama company has also recently 
  completed a $42 million contract with Saudi Arabia to build 1,000 
  modern prefabricated townhouses.
     </p>
     <p>
      Foreign oil money will also give a boost to the economies of 
  Birmingham and Mobile, Alabama. A Birmingham-based firm is in final 
  contract stages with the Arabian Sheikdom of Abu Dhabi for a $52 
  million water pipeline project. The 33,000-ton pipe order will be 
  shipped through the Mobile, Alabama, port. Martin-Marietta 
  Corporation of Orlando, Florida, has received a $30 million Air 
  Force contract. Three Alabama Army bases are to receive nearly $60 
  million in Government funds in fiscal 1976. Several construction 
  projects at medical complexes in New Orleans and Atlanta should give 
  a boost to these cities' economies. However, in Atlanta, 
  construction laborers went on strike July 1, stopping construction 
  on $150 million worth of downtown hotel projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tourist trade remains very strong in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, 
  and Tennessee. Reports from Tennessee indicate a record year for 
  tourism. Tourist traffic is particularly strong in Nashville. The 
  new Nashville Hyatt Regency is already booking conventions through 
  1981. Tourist traffic in Georgia, according to travel statistics, is 
  up nearly 20 percent from a year ago; and, as mentioned in earlier 
  reports, tourist activity on the western coast and central parts of 
  Florida remains up 50 to 80 percent from last year.
