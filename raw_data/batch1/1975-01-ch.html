      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 15, 1975
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The economic situation in the Seventh District has continued to 
worsen rapidly. Most companies and governmental units are laying off 
workers or are pursuing a very tight policy on new hirings. With 
heavy capital goods still an exception, output is declining in most 
manufacturing sectors. Inventory-reduction programs are now 
widespread, as shortages of many materials and components have 
turned into surpluses. Many consumers have cut spending of big-ticket items and are using credit less extensively. Firms selling in 
Canada report that demand continues to be relatively strong there, 
both for consumer and capital goods. There are no early prospects 
for a revival in construction, either residential or nonresidential. 
Farmers intend to plant very large acreages this year. Hog and 
poultry production is being reduced very substantially. Most 
analysts expect real gross national product (GNP) to decline further 
in the first and second quarters, perhaps with industrial production 
bottoming-out in the third quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rapid rise in unemployment compensation claims to record levels 
has swamped official agencies, especially in the Detroit and Chicago 
areas but also in many smaller centers. The extent of the 
unemployment problem in both the Chicago and the Detroit areas is 
probably unprecedented since World War II, with no early turnaround 
in sight.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent days, thousands of people have jammed Chicago's City Hall 
to apply for 977 "public service jobs" allotted under the Federal 
program. Most consumer goods producers and some capital goods 
producers have laid off workers. Some have substantially extended 
normal Christmas or January "vacations", with salaried workers often 
included. Various state and local governments have either reduced 
staff or have frozen hirings, pleading budget restraints. No 
important employers appear to be hiring actively.
       </p>
       <p>
        A substantial majority of firms are cutting inventories, often 
hoping to cut their total by 20 percent or more in two or three 
months. Inventory reductions are dictated, in part, by financial 
stringencies, but more commonly by the return to a "full-fledged 
buyers' market". Lead times have been reduced very rapidly, and 
vendor dependability has improved. Prices are "being negotiated 
again", and prices of many materials and components have softened.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virtually all types of steel are now available, despite production 
problems associated with shortages of coal and other materials. 
Plates and structurals for capital goods, however, are still on 
allocation. Fabricators of steel for industrial structures are still 
operating all out, but little new business is being booked. A 
producer of farm equipment says it may have to lay off workers 
because it has depended on steel from the Gary open hearth furnaces, 
shut down on January 1 by EPA order. One steel company expects total 
mill shipments to be off 10 percent in 1975 from last year. The 
first quarter may be off 17 percent, partly because of unexpectedly 
large imports of high-priced foreign steel in recent months. Raw 
steel output will be fairly well maintained as mills rebuild 
depleted inventories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories of all major petroleum products are "very comfortable". 
Most companies are pushing exploration at full speed, but no new 
refineries are planned and some projects have been stopped in 
midstream. The problem is availability of crude. Refineries are 
operating at 85 percent of capacity, including imports of natural 
gas liquids, compared with virtually 100 percent prior to the oil 
embargo. The President's desire to cut oil imports by 1 million 
barrels a day is regarded as unrealistic, because domestic crude 
output is still declining.
       </p>
       <p>
        Producers of heavy capital equipment for basic industries continue 
to operate at capacity, but backlogs are declining. A very large 
producer of earth-moving equipment says lighter equipment is now off 
allocation, and all but the very heaviest machines will be off 
allocation by midyear. Reported declines in net new orders for some 
capital goods are exaggerated because firms have deliberately 
"purged" or "dried out" these backlogs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Order backlogs for heavy trucks "dissolved" in the fourth quarter. 
One expert believes sales of heavy trucks will be off by one third 
in 1975. Inventories in the field turned out to be much larger than 
had been thought, and some fleet owners purchased many trucks that 
have not been operated. Some orders had been duplicated, and 
substantial advance buying had occurred to beat the brake standards 
set for March 1. Postponing these standards again could hurt sales, 
because truck producers have been stocking the necessary components.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales of general merchandise are reported to have improved 
just prior to Christmas. Most consumers are buying cautiously, but 
sales of high-priced items, e.g., autos, furniture, and houses, have 
been relatively well maintained. Widespread price cutting by 
retailers, starting in November, may not be adequately reflected in 
the consumer price index. Real volume has been higher for some major 
chains. Retailers are trying to cut inventories as much as possible 
by January 31, the end of their fiscal year. Some banks and 
retailers report a rise in consumer delinquencies, but not of 
alarming proportions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inventories of new autos are very heavy relative to sales, 
especially for subcompacts and imports. Nevertheless, reduced first-quarter output schedules are probably firm for all but one producer 
"who has no schedule". The atmosphere in Detroit is almost 
desperate. Sales of used cars have been very good, prices have been 
strong, and "independent" dealers have been prosperous.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sales of houses and apartments have remained very slow. Inflows to
savings and loan associations have improved, but most of them wish 
to pay off high-cost debt. Illinois savings and loan associations 
are not making commitments past June 30, when the treasury rate 
reverts from 9.5 percent to 8 percent. Land development of all types 
"collapsed" in the fourth quarter.
