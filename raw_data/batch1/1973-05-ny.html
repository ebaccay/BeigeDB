      Beige Book Report: New York

       May 9, 1973
      </strong>

      <p>
       According to Second District directors and other business leaders 
contacted recently, consumer spending continues strong, in part 
stimulated by expectations of higher prices. Residential 
construction also remains at a high level, on balance, although 
signs of tapering off have emerged. Shortages of raw materials, of 
energy, and of some semi-finished and finished products appear to be 
growing. The further recent devaluation of the dollar, combined with 
the previous devaluation, in general was expected to bring about an 
improvement in the country's international trade balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most respondents reported continued strength in consumer spending 
despite increased consumer uncertainties regarding the economic 
outlook, notably a growing concern over inflation. It was the 
consensus of the Buffalo branch directors that the deterioration in 
consumer confidence had in fact been reflected in a "rather broad-
based" increase in retail sales, which some of the directors viewed 
as an attempt by consumers to "beat" anticipated price increases. In 
the case of automobiles, the desire to avoid paying for the 
additional safety and pollution-control devices mandated for 1974 
was noted as a factor pushing up current sales. The president of a 
large nationwide chain of retail outlets stated that despite surveys 
showing a decline in consumer confidence, retail sales continue very 
strong, with sales of durable goods leading the way. And the 
president of a chain of department stores in the New York City area 
similarly reported a good demand for durable goods, which he also 
linked to a desire to avoid paying anticipated higher prices. This 
respondent, however, felt that in general the pickup in business on 
the East Coast was lagging behind the national performance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The respondents in general continued to find the home-building 
picture strong although a number saw some evidence of a tapering 
off. A Rochester banker, who reported construction in his area was 
still booming, said that there has been a significant shift from 
apartment building to condominium and town house construction, and 
that construction of single-family residences was proceeding at an 
active, but more selective pace. The chairman of the board of a 
multinational oil corporation and the president of a large 
nonferrous metal-producing corporation both reported they saw no 
evidence of a cutback in residential construction. A senior official 
of a large Rochester multinational firm, however, reported some 
decline in residential building, characterizing last year's national 
high housing start rate as "not sustainable." Another director felt 
that the housing boom gave indication of tapering off. In regard to 
nonresidential construction, an upstate banker mentioned the high 
level of commercial construction that was still related to the 
rebuilding of businesses destroyed by Hurricane Agnes last June, 
However, a New Jersey banker reported a glut of office space in his 
area, while the president of a New York City real estate firm 
reported that at least 20 million square feet of commercial and 
industrial building space was currently vacant in the city.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in recent previous months, the respondents referred to a growing 
list of shortages of certain resources. The official of the 
Rochester multinational firm stated that raw material shortages were 
widespread, including such items as wood products, coal tar 
derivatives, and other products. A Buffalo manufacturer expressed 
concern that a period of tight supply was imminent, as evidenced by 
the fact that his firm was being confronted with 20- to 30-week lead 
times for many raw material items. A New Jersey banker reported 
inventories of firms in his area to be low, with six- to eight-month 
delivery times for new orders. The owner of a large upstate 
agricultural enterprise mentioned a shortage of protein in all 
forms, which was increasing the cost of feed items for poultry and 
livestock. A number of respondents commented on the petroleum 
products shortage. According to the chairman of the international 
oil company, worldwide supplies of crude oil remain tight, and U. S. 
production of fuel oil has peaked and is expected to decline. The 
recent relaxing of oil import restrictions should help, but lie felt 
that environmental controls were hindering domestic output. Similar 
sentiments were expressed by a senior official of a firm producing a 
wide variety of petroleum products. The president of the nonferrous 
metals producer noted that power shortages in certain areas were 
adversely affecting aluminum output.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dollar devaluation was viewed as likely to improve this 
country's international trade position, both on the import and 
export side. True, the higher dollar costs of oil and nonferrous 
metal imports were cited as adverse factors. The New Jersey banker, 
however, said that export sales have increased substantially—although he felt it was difficult to estimate the extent of the 
basic improvement due to price increases and sales to Russia and 
China. The Buffalo branch directors generally agreed that the 
exchange rate realignments would have a "positive" impact on our 
trade balance. One director specifically mentioned that a Rochester 
machine tool firm, which exports about 70 percent of its output, now 
expects its overall sales to increase substantially. On the import 
side, the president of the large nationwide chain of retail outlets 
expected the devaluation to slow the growth in the dollar amount of 
imports of his firm. He stated that in terms of cost, the balance 
had now been swung in favor of certain domestic goods, for example, 
some types of consumer electronics. Also, a Buffalo director felt 
the devaluations have made it easier for this country's automobile 
industry to compete with imported cars. He also noted that the 
domestic shortages noted above in part reflected a switch by many 
buyers from foreign to domestic sources.
