      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        After a three-month lull, Third District economic activity is again 
picking up. The sluggishness in manufacturing which began in 
December has given way to noticeable expansion, and the retail 
sector continues its strong performance this month. In 
manufacturing, new orders are up substantially from last month and 
there is a modest net accumulation of inventories. At the same time, 
employment is higher and the average workweek is longer. Prices in 
this sector are up, but the price pressures are about the same as in 
February. The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is 
for additional growth. Area retailers report healthy sales and look 
for further gains through the fall. Bankers in the region indicate 
that loan volume is still soft.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturers responding to this month's business outlook survey 
report that business conditions are substantially better than last 
month. This represents a return to expansion after a three-month 
period of sluggishness. In the current survey, 53 percent of the 
respondents report a higher level of business activity while the 
proportion indicating improvement in the December- through -February 
period averaged less than half of this. New orders are significantly 
higher, with almost half of those polled reporting increases. 
Employment and the average workweek are moderately higher as well. 
At the same time, inventory liquidation has given way to net 
accumulation this month, with a third of those surveyed reporting 
increases as compared with one fourth indicating declines. This is 
the first report of overall inventory accumulation in a year and a 
half.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outlook in manufacturing for the next two quarters is for 
additional gains. Nine out of ten businessmen surveyed anticipate 
expansion. New orders are expected to be higher by Labor Day, and a 
slight net accumulation of inventories is projected. At the same 
time, close to 60 percent of the manufacturers polled plan to hire 
additional employees and 24 percent anticipate lengthening the 
workweek. In addition, four out of ten respondents plan to hike 
their spending for plant and equipment over the period.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers in the area report good sales performance. Sales were 
expected to be about 10 percent above year-ago levels, and retailers 
indicate that current volumes are above that. Moreover, the growth 
is reported to be broad based with no appreciable difference between 
hard goods and soft goods. The outlook for spring and fall is for 
continued strength. One merchant expects fall to be better than 
spring, and another looks for fall sales forecasts at his store to 
be revised upward by Easter. All of the merchants contacted indicate 
that inventories are in good shape and commitments are lengthening. 
One executive notes that inventory commitments were running about 
five weeks ahead at this time last year while currently they are out 
around eight weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the inflation front, manufacturers report paying and charging 
higher prices this month, but there is no significant change in the 
distribution of responses from last month. Forty percent of the 
respondents report paying more for their supplies currently, and 20 
percent indicate charging more for their finished products. The 
outlook is for additional price increases in the six months ahead. 
Four fifths of those surveyed expect to be paying more for their 
inputs over the period, and three fourths anticipate higher price 
tags for the products they sell. In the retail sector, price 
increases are generally reported to be "modest." One merchant notes 
that he is no longer seeing price cuts in electronics, while another 
indicates a gradual pickup in fiber prices, especially cotton. He 
adds that, with heavy demand, there is no particular problem in 
passing on these higher costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Area bankers generally report that loan volume is flat. Loan demand 
is expected to pick up, but there is a lot of uncertainty as to when 
this will occur. One banker expects loans to increase sometime in 
the second half of the year, "but we keep pushing the timing of the 
expansion farther into the future". Another notes that two views at 
his bank are for an increase by either midyear or "well into the 
last quarter of 1976". This banker adds that the market is very 
competitive with a lot of rate cutting, and he takes this as a sign 
of no expected pickup in loan demand very soon. "The kind of rate 
cutting we're seeing now is not the kind you'd see if people 
expected loan demand to move upward quickly."
       </p>
       <p>
        The bankers contacted were unanimous in their views that short-term 
interest rates will move upward from this point, but there is 
uncertainty as to when the climb will begin. In any case, there is 
no expectation of any significant jump in short-term rates. The 
consensus is for a prime of 7.5 percent six months from now and 8.5 
percent by the year-end. All of the bankers contacted feel that 
recent "problem list" disclosures have resulted in a more 
conservative attitude in granting loans. Nevertheless, city bankers 
feel that this effect is probably not significant. On the other 
hand, one country banker notes that, as a result of the disclosures, 
his bank's board of directors is much harsher on customers when 
scrutinizing loan requests. He adds: "There are a few delinquent 
loans that are being put into liquidation. I doubt that this would 
be happening if it weren't for those disclosures."
