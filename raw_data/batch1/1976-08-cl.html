      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Plant shutdowns and summer vacations have slowed economic activity 
  in the Fourth District. Consumer spending for automobiles, 
  recreation, home remodeling, and new houses continues relatively 
  strong, but sales of department store goods were soft again in July. 
  Recovery in capital goods continues to be spotty. Neither the rubber 
  strike nor the coal strike has disrupted operations of their 
  consumers. Tightness in supplies of certain steel and chemical 
  products appears to have eased as a result of a recent slowing in 
  orders. Several thrift institutions report some deposit losses as a 
  result of last week's 8 percent Treasury note but less than in 
  previous periods of comparable yield spreads.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending continues to be selective and spotty. Car sales, 
  recreation and amusement spending, and home improvement expenditures 
  remain strong. Auto sales in July, especially of medium-size cars, 
  held up relatively well in the largest metropolitan centers of the 
  District. Home improvement business continues to flourish according 
  to banker directors and a director associated with a building 
  materials firm. Another director reported new attendance and 
  spending records for amusement by consumers. Some retailers of 
  department store goods complained that sales were again soft last 
  month. A financial officer with a large department store that caters 
  to middle- and upper-income earners reports that sportswear is 
  selling well, accessories are still selling better than a year 
  earlier, but ready-to-wear apparel is selling poorly. Collections 
  have not been a problem. A financial officer with a large discount 
  chain describes sales of both hard and soft goods as flat.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer demand for single-family housing is strong, and directors 
  as well as officials with thrift institutions report brisk loan 
  demand. One director expects new housing starts to average 1.5 
  million units in 1976 and projects an increase to 1.7 million units 
  in 1977. High costs of single-family units have boosted demand for 
  mobile homes. Construction of multifamily dwellings remains weak, 
  according to several mortgage lenders, although one director noted 
  that gradually improving vacancy rates are contributing to a pickup 
  in demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods are still marked by sluggish recovery and ample 
  capacity. Some producers do not expect to reach their pre-recession 
  peak until 1978. Sales of heavy-duty trucks and industrial lift 
  trucks have been recovering, but significant improvement is not 
  expected until 1977. One official expects that the next peak for 
  these capital goods is unlikely to be as high as the 1974 peak; even 
  if it were, shortages are unlikely to appear because of recent 
  expansion in capacity for trucks, axles, and other material handling 
  equipment. An electronics and printing press firm reports both 
  orders and backlogs last month were at their highest volume in 
  recent years. Capacity for producing printing equipment is judged to 
  be adequate for the next few years because of the large amount of 
  unused capacity, but a shortage of capacity for semiconductors, 
  radio- and TV-broadcasting equipment and other communication 
  equipment will require the firm to double its capital spending 
  beginning this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial officers and economists in the steel and chemical 
  industries view their capacity as adequate to accommodate demand 
  this year and most of 1977, although spot shortages may surface 
  later this year. Steel economists with major producers in the 
  District report that orders and shipments slumped more than usual in 
  July and August. One economist expects a strong rebound in the late 
  summer and fall months and has revised his estimates of shipments 
  for 1976 slightly upward. However, an economist with another steel 
  company has recently revised his forecast downward because of 
  continued sluggishness in capital goods and a lack of inventory 
  buildup by steel users. Tightness in flat-rolled products has eased, 
  although some steel mills are apparently still informally allocating 
  orders. Coke is expected to be in tight supply in 1977 because of 
  environmental standards that are restricting production from some 
  existing coke-oven facilities in the District.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chemical producers report that operating rates for their firms 
  continue to climb moderately. Output in July and August softened 
  because of plant shutdowns of customers. PVC, polypropylene, and 
  chlorine are among products in tight supply, and some spot shortages 
  can surface by the year-end.
     </p>
     <p>
      Neither the rubber strike nor the coal strike has hampered output of 
  users. According to an economist with a major tire producer, the 
  rubber strike can continue for another few months without curtailing 
  auto production. He cited the sustained operations by nonstruck 
  suppliers and small independent tire producers who have been selling 
  the bulk of their output directly to auto producers rather than in 
  the replacement market. According to his view, the replacement 
  market will be affected more seriously than the original equipment 
  market, if the strike continues much longer. The wildcat strike in 
  the coal industry, which has caused an estimated 10 million ton loss 
  in coal output, will have little if any effect on coal consumers 
  because inventories were already well above the normal 65-day supply 
  before the strike. Metallurgical coal will be in tight supply 
  because of restricted coal output, but steel economists do not 
  expect that supplies will hinder a rebound in steel operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      Financial officers with savings and loan associations commented that 
  the full extent of deposit losses resulting from last week's 8 
  percent Treasury note will not be known until the final payment date 
  on August 16. An official with one of the largest savings and loan 
  associations in the District expects heavy withdrawals on that date. 
  Several small- and medium-size associations detected no significant 
  withdrawals of deposits, but they noted that net deposit growth for 
  the last several weeks has wavered between losses and modest gains. 
  Despite some runoff in deposits, none of the savings and loan 
  associations expect to curtail commitments or loans. Liquidity is 
  still above minimum requirements, and deposit growth is expected to 
  recover beginning in September, although at rates below the rapid 
  growth earlier in 1976.
