      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 16, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       There are some signs of weakening in retail sales and a softening in 
the manufacturing sector. Capital goods industries are still doing 
well, but automotive-related business has been hit hard. Large firms 
appear to be weathering the effects of the energy situation better 
than smaller firms. Prospects for the steel industry remain good, 
despite the downturn in autos and housing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department store sales in the District seem to have been a mixed 
situation during the holiday season. One of our directors, with a 
national retailing firm, reported that sales were poor in the 
District relative to the nation. There was strong demand for luxury 
items, which was attributed largely to anticipatory buying, as a 
hedge against inflation or, possibly, as an investment. The same 
director also indicated that he expects additional upward pressures 
on retail prices in the months ahead as a result of higher priced 
goods in the early stages of the retail pipeline. Finally, the 
senior management of the firm is less optimistic about the economic 
outlook than they were last fall, and they are reexamining their 
capital expenditure plans for 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       In contrast, the president of a large department store in Cleveland 
reported that holiday sales were good, although he noted some 
decline in luxury goods. Credit sales were stronger than expected 
because of a highly publicized deferred billing plan promoted by the 
firm. The post-Christmas season, however, has been marked by a 
larger volume of merchandise returns than last year. A vigorous 
promotion to interest customers will be necessary in the coming 
months, according to the executive, because of the rising number of 
layoffs taking place in firms caused by the energy situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our monthly (December) survey of District manufacturers indicates 
further slowing in the pace of manufacturing activity and continued 
upward pressures on prices. There was a significant reduction in the 
proportion of firms reporting gains in new orders, and a continued 
slowdown in the rate of inventory accumulation, employment, and 
hours. In addition, business expectations for January are not 
particularly encouraging. The diffusion index for prices paid 
reached a record high for the third consecutive month.
      </p>
      <p>
       Automotive-related business has dropped sharply in many firms, and 
in recent weeks there have been widespread reports of layoffs among 
auto producers and suppliers in the District. According to an 
economist with a firm heavily dependent on the motor vehicle 
industry, cyclical forces are expected to account for the bulk of 
the decline in new car sales this year. As early as last August, 
this economist had forecast an 8 percent decline in new car sales 
for 1974. He expects that the petroleum situation will reduce sales 
by another 3 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Purchasing agents in the Cleveland area report that virtually 
everything they buy is in short supply and that delivery time 
continues to grow longer. The lead times on orders now being placed 
go well into 1974 and 1975. More than half of the buyers say that 
three to six months are needed for delivery of production materials 
and a year or more for capital equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Machine tool builders in the area report that incoming new orders 
are still strong and that a heavy volume of inquiries indicated 
strength in future orders. Although a few firms report some 
cancellations as a result of the energy situation, the cancellation 
rate is viewed as normal with the current length of lead times. The 
high level of backlogs assures capacity operations in the industry 
well into 1974, even if new orders should decline in the months 
ahead. One of our directors in the machine tool business 
corroborates the strength in the industry and, he adds, the coal 
companies are buying everything they can get their hands on.
      </p>
      <p>
       A leading producer of casting equipment in Cleveland says the 
foundry business is so strong these days that the firm has a year's 
backlog on the books-three times the normal level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Economists from three major steel firms in the District all report 
some order cancellations from the automotive industry. Two 
companies, however, say the decline in steel orders is less than the 
cutback in auto production. According to the steel industry 
economists, the auto firms usually draw down their steel inventories 
when output is reduced, which reinforces the decline in steel 
orders. The auto companies do not appear to be following their 
normal steel-inventory policy, thus far, however.
      </p>
      <p>
       The slack created by the auto firms is being absorbed by other 
steel-using industries. Demand for steel products other than sheets 
remains greater than the steel firms' ability to produce. The steel 
companies are continuing to operate at peak capacity with full order 
books. Some of their concern over possible fuel shortages has been 
alleviated since last month. It now appears that the steel companies 
will receive enough fuel in 1974 to enable them to produce as much 
steel as last year. The 5.5 million to 6 million tons of steel 
shipped from mill inventories last year, but not available this 
year, will just about be offset by reduced steel demand for autos, 
furniture, and appliances. Moreover, imports are expected to be hit 
before domestic steel by any decline in demand, because the price 
differential is so large.
