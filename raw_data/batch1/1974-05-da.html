       May 15, 1974
      </strong>

     <div>
      <p>
       In discussing current economic and credit conditions at the May 9, 
1974, meeting of our Board, the directors expressed opinions on 
inventory positions in their own industries, expected business loan 
demand, status of shortages of supplies and materials, and overall 
price trends.
      </p>
      <p>
       Directors, in the retail field, believe inventories to be 
increasing. largely in the big-ticket items such as furniture and 
appliances, but think a sizable portion of the increase can be 
accounted for by price changes as opposed to large increases in 
numbers of units. The retail business generally has remained fairly 
strong although there has been some leveling in sales. It was 
pointed out that goods to be offered for sale in the next 90 days 
will be at higher prices, and it remains to be seen what consumers' 
reactions to such prices will be. In looking at the southwestern 
part of the United States, generally the opinion expressed was that 
increase in sales are about even with the increase in inflation. The 
cost of maintaining inventories has increased substantially with 
higher interest rates, and there is somewhat of a squeeze on 
profits. Most retailers appear to be holding their inventories a 
little lower than usual in order to avoid committing too far in 
advance.
      </p>
      <p>
       On production, continued shortages of supplies and materials in 
certain areas are causing disruptions. Business is very active in 
energy-related fields. While there have been increases in the 
quantities of units produced, the large dollar figures are accounted 
for in considerable measure by inflation. New price increases will 
be a real factor in how well business fares over the coming months. 
All directors anticipate further price increases and referred to the 
fact that prices of a number of items, such as heavy equipment, 
manufactured goods, and steel products, are set at the time of 
delivery, rather than at the time of ordering. Concern also was 
expressed with the ability to finance large projects in the energy 
field.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bank directors reported that business loan demand at commercial 
banks is continuing quite heavy in this part of the country, 
particularly with large national companies calling upon previous 
commitments. It is expected that such business loan demand will 
continue quite strong. There is evidence of disintermediation as 
deposits are trending downward and money is going directly into high 
yield investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were differences of opinion as to whether interest rates have 
topped out and whether there will be a sharp decline in interest 
rates this year. Most of the directors do not expect significant 
declines in interest rates in the near future. It was recognized 
that if interest rates are not effective in dampening loan demand, 
the alternative will be greater restriction on the availability of 
credit. The principal problem here, of course, is to avoid a credit 
crunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Home-building in Texas is being hampered by tightening mortgage 
markets. A survey of leading savings and loan associations in the 
state revealed that most, suffered sizable deposit losses in April. 
For example, the two largest savings associations in Houston lost in 
excess of $1 million each during the month. Many large accounts, 
those in excess of $100,000, were withdrawn and were reported to 
have been mostly reinvested in Treasury bills. But lenders feel that 
the current round of disintermediation has been less severe than the 
loss of deposits following the implementation of wild card CD's last 
summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, recent deposit losses are proving difficult to offset 
from other sources. The secondary mortgage market is currently 
described by those surveyed as a "buyers market." In addition, the 
Federal Home Loan Bank of Little Rock, which has jurisdiction in the 
Southwest, is maintaining a restrictive policy stance. The variable 
rate on advances was raised on April 30 from 9-1/2 percent to 10 
percent, which is equal to the usury ceiling in Texas on primary 
mortgage loans. Also, by regulation, advances cannot be made to 
cover the loss of CD's in excess of $100,000. Therefore, savings 
institutions in the state that are losing these large deposits are 
now looking elsewhere for funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings and loan associations across the state are responding to 
losses of deposits by raising rates and cutting back sharply on 
loans and commitments. During the last two weeks of April many 
raised their prime mortgage rates on conventional loans to 9 percent 
from 8-1/2 percent. Most of the lenders interviewed felt mortgage 
rates will go higher, probably reaching 9-1/4 percent by mid-May.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mortgage lenders report home buyers are much less sensitive to the 
recent rise in mortgage rates than they were when rates moved up at 
the end of last summer. Buyers generally expect housing prices will 
continue to climb rapidly, and waiting until mortgage rates decline 
is no longer viewed as a means of reducing the total cost of a 
house. However, the president of a large savings and loan 
association in Texas points out that borrower resistance to rising 
mortgage rates stiffens as rates approach whole numbers, and he 
predicts many borrowers will shy away, at least temporarily, from 
the 9 percent rate. The most noticeable impact of tightening 
mortgage markets is that lending institutions are making more 
conservative estimates of the value of homes and are cutting back on 
the size of individual mortgage commitments.
