      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        The significantly improved tone in business and finance in the 
  Seventh District noted a month ago has generally been confirmed by 
  more recent developments. Various forecasts of increases in activity 
  have been raised, are presented more confidently, and are more 
  frequently extended into 1977. Retailers are pleased with recent 
  increases in demand—"across the board". Some new layoffs have been 
  announced, but total employment appears to be rising. With notable 
  exceptions, price inflation seems to be gathering momentum mainly 
  because of increased worker compensation. Mortgage funds are more 
  available, especially for single-family homes. Near-term prospects 
  for a significant rise in total capital spending remain poor.
       </p>
       <p>
        The business expansion is based on the greater willingness of 
  consumers to spend confidently (and to use credit) to purchase 
  products in virtually all categories. One large general 
  merchandiser, who had been very skeptical of reports of improvements 
  several months ago, now says that customers are buying more freely, 
  especially the "middle and top" lines. Inventories are moderate, and 
  profits have improved significantly. Perhaps the most dramatic 
  improvement in this quarter has been in major household appliances. 
  Except for freezers, which were booming early last year, sales of 
  appliances have strengthened and inventories are uncomfortably low 
  at the factory and distributor levels. Recreational vehicles also 
  are doing much better.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand for workers has improved overall, and unemployment claims are 
  down sharply. A producer of diesel engines says that all laid-off 
  workers have been recalled. Similar reports came from a steel 
  company and an appliance firm. On the other hand, a disquieting 
  number of reports tell of layoffs in the near future. A large 
  airline is cutting its headquarters staff by 10 percent to help 
  restore profitability, several manufacturers have announced plans to 
  shut plants in Chicago permanently, new layoffs will occur at a 
  Kenosha auto plant that produces small cars and a Rockford plant 
  that produces large cars, and the city of Detroit has scheduled 
  reductions in staff of 4,000 workers, or 20 percent, by July 1 to 
  reduce the prospective deficit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chicago area teamsters are demanding a 35 percent increase in 
  compensation over three years and an unlimited cost of living 
  adjustment. These demands may be scaled down but not much, judging 
  by negotiations already determined elsewhere. Nonunion truckers are 
  said to be gaining business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Employers in Michigan and Illinois are concerned about a workmen's 
  compensation "crisis". Liberalized laws and new rulings have greatly 
  expanded actual and potential payouts. Insurance costs have 
  increased 50 percent in recent renewals, and costs are expected to 
  go much higher. Some employers are finding that such coverage is 
  difficult to obtain at any price.
       </p>
       <p>
        The outlook for capital goods is mixed, with some firms still 
  operating at capacity and others working off backlogs rapidly. Large 
  mining equipment is still backlogged, but demand for smaller types 
  has weakened. Output of railroad equipment is declining, with no 
  reversal in sight. Producers of trucks have raised output schedules 
  but from very low levels. Farm machinery sales are expected to be 
  excellent this year. A diversified producer of capital goods is "much encouraged" by a pronounced improvement in orders for 
  February, especially for materials-handling equipment. Orders for 
  structural steel and plate used mainly in equipment and heavy 
  construction remain weak, in contrast to substantial strength in 
  light products used in autos and appliances. Demand for heavy 
  castings and forgings also remains depressed. Major architectural 
  firms are reducing staff because of the small volume of proposed new 
  work in the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgage funds are increasingly available from savings and loan 
  associations and other lenders at gradually lower rates. New home 
  mortgages are down to 8 1/2 percent in a number of areas. Mortgage 
  rates on apartments and well-placed commercial properties have 
  dropped under 10 percent. Nevertheless, any improvement in new 
  construction this year is likely to be concentrated in single-family 
  homes. A construction cost index for the Chicago area rose only 5 
  percent in the past year, half as much as in earlier years. More 
  important, bids on new construction projects are down significantly 
  in many cases for the first time in many years, especially for 
  structural steel work, as "hungry" contractors compete for business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Large crop plantings are in prospect in the District. Farm machinery 
  sales have been unseasonably good and are expected to rise for the 
  year. Prices of some types of fertilizer are down very sharply. Some 
  sales of Iowa farmland at $2,000 amaze experienced observers. Such 
  sales are still rare, but it is said that anyone who owns a section 
  of Iowa land is, per se, "a millionaire". Life insurance companies 
  are showing renewed interest in farm mortgages. The recent decline 
  in wholesale beef prices was surprising to observers and is expected 
  to reverse in the second quarter. Further reductions in retail beef 
  prices are expected.
