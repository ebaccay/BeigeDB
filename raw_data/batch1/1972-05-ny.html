      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 17, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Opinions expressed by Head Office and Buffalo Branch directors and 
other business leaders point to further advances in economic 
activity. Plant and equipment spending is apparently being upgraded, 
consumer confidence is improving, and the demand for business loans 
is strengthening. The unemployment situation, however, while 
improving slightly, remains far from satisfactory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most respondents looked for a further upgrading of plant and 
equipment spending over the balance of the year, but were more 
restrained regarding the strength of the upswing than suggested by 
recent surveys. Among the Head Office directors, the chairman of the 
board of a large New York City bank thought the capital expenditures 
outlook was good, but not as favorable as the McGraw-Hill Survey 
indicated. The president of a large nonferrous metal firm stated 
that recent reports of an upgrading of plans for capital outlays may 
be "fairly accurate," but could not confirm these on the basis of 
his business' own experience. The Buffalo Branch directors felt the 
tone in the capital goods sector was taking a turn for the better 
and reported that a number of small businesses were expanding 
facilities and that the demand for improved equipment was 
particularly strong. However, a Rochester retailer, a Head Office 
director, stated that while the largest upstate firm was adhering to 
current expansion plans, several other companies were planning 
cutbacks. Opinions expressed by some business leaders were also less 
optimistic: A senior official of a large electric equipment firm 
said talk about heavy capital spending was not reflected in his 
firm's heavy machinery business, which was slow.
      </p>
      <p>
       As noted in last month's report, the March-April retail sales 
picture has been somewhat blurred by the early Easter, which 
favorably affected March sales. Nevertheless, the views expressed by 
most respondents, on balance, point to the emergence of a brighter 
consumer spending picture. Most of the Buffalo directors thus 
reported a pickup in retail sales following a somewhat disappointing 
Easter season in Western New York, and these directors felt that 
consumers' moods had brightened. Most reported local retailers are 
expecting to meet 1972 sales projections as consumer demand 
continues to strengthen. Among the Head Office directors, the large 
New York City banker found the retail picture fairly encouraging, 
and the Rochester retailer was optimistic about the outlook, despite 
the fact current business in the Buffalo-Rochester-Syracuse area was 
not good. The vice president of a large nationwide chain of 
department stores reported that sales in both March and April had 
been good, indeed better than his firm's expectations, and that on 
the basis of preliminary reports, the trend was continuing in early 
May. He noted special strength in home appliances and furnishings, 
presumably linked to the occupancy of new housing. In his view, the 
consumers have not become reasonably confident, and his firm was 
optimistic regarding the remainder of the year. Moreover, indirect 
indications of gathering strength in consumer sales were also 
evident in the comments of several manufacturers. Thus, the senior 
official of the electric equipment firm reported their consumer 
goods sales were moving well, in some areas with "considerable 
strength," while the president of an upstate manufacturing firm 
reported a significant pickup in his company's sales of auto parts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those directors who expressed an opinion on the business loan 
situation reported a strengthening in such credit, primarily related 
to construction projects. Three of the Buffalo Branch bankers 
pointed to the increase in loans to finance the construction of 
multiple dwellings units, including condominiums. One of these 
directors, while noting the strong demand for construction credit, 
referred to the sluggishness in demand from national firms, which he 
felt were raising needed funds in the equity and bond markets rather 
than drawing on their credit lines. Some of the respondents expected 
an eventual improvement accumulation would bring further increases 
in the demand for business loans. With respect to other types of 
loans, among the Head Office directors, the president of an upstate 
bank reported a strong demand for credit in his area, especially in 
mortgage loans for new apartments (but also for new factories), 
while the chairman of the large New York City bank stated that loans 
to finance companies and real estate loans have been particularly 
heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Directors felt that some improvement-albeit scattered and as yet 
limited-was occurring in the unemployment situation. The president 
of the metal producing corporation reported that there seems to be 
some improvement in Arizona and California and pointed to the 
fractional rise in March and April in help wanted advertising in the 
West and Southwest. The New York City banker felt the situation had 
improved slightly, but remarked that a decline in the overall 
unemployment rate was difficult because of the sizable influx of new 
entrants into the work force. The Buffalo Branch directors generally 
agreed that there had been some recent improvement in the local 
employment situation, but noted that this must be viewed against the 
high unemployment rates prevailing during the winter. They noted 
that the local picture was still not good-while skilled workers were 
again in demand, unemployment among the unskilled would continue to 
plague the area.
