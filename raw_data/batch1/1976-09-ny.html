      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Scattered signs of pickup in the pace of business activity in the 
  Second District were reported by directors and businessmen who were 
  contacted recently. In early September, there appears to have been a 
  substantial rebound in New York City's retail sales. The strength of 
  this improvement was so pronounced that merchants expected its 
  momentum to carry through the remainder of the month. Other sectors 
  of the region's economy appear much less buoyant and continue to lag 
  behind the nation's recovery. In the view of respondents, inventory 
  investment appears unlikely to be stepped up significantly; and 
  while capital spending is increasing, it has gathered little 
  momentum in this District. The financial scene reflects these 
  developments, with loan demand showing few signs of reviving.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales in and around New York City appear to have gained 
  substantial momentum in recent weeks. Executives of several leading 
  department stores reported a surge in consumer buying activity that 
  began with the Labor Day weekend. One department store official 
  characterized sales as "tremendous," and other respondents felt that 
  sales gains were substantial and well above typical holiday and 
  back-to-school buying. The pickup was large enough that a vice 
  president of a national retailer observed that New York sales, which 
  had been lagging the rest of the nation, had now caught up to the 
  nation. The pickup in buying cut across all product lines, but 
  smaller kitchen and personal care appliances were pointed to as 
  leading the advance in one department store.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the view of at least some merchants, Sunday openings have been an 
  important factor in adding further impetus to the recovery in 
  consumer buying. Major department stores in New York City and the 
  metropolitan area last month began to open their doors on Sundays, 
  and Sunday openings appear to be gaining acceptance among retailers. 
  Most retailers were convinced that Sunday hours have added 
  substantially to total sales rather than merely redistributing daily 
  sales within the week. In addition to providing a shopping day to 
  those who work on Saturday, merchants noted that heads of households 
  were more likely to shop on Sunday, thus increasing the likelihood 
  of big-ticket or credit buying. Whatever the cause of the 
  acceleration in consumer activity, most retailers expected the 
  momentum to carry through the month.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors of the Buffalo Branch were less sure of the upturn in 
  consumer spending and were generally gloomy over prospects of the 
  fall selling season. The reluctance of consumers to spend was 
  attributed to a lack of sufficient confidence as well as continued 
  concern about job security. The president of a Buffalo department 
  store chain reported August sales were below a year ago; however, at 
  the same time, the chief executive of a major Rochester retail firm 
  stated that conditions had improved.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to the outlook for business fixed investment spending, 
  Second District directors reported little evidence of a step-up in 
  capital spending plans. The chairman of a multinational oil company 
  observed that the percentage increase in petroleum industry spending 
  would exceed the rate of price increases. One executive in the 
  electrical construction business reported a shift from governmental 
  to private spending as limited evidence of a revival of capital 
  spending plans in Western New York.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods production in the District continues to lag, however. 
  Most producers report some pickup in new orders, but business 
  remains below their earlier expectations. The corporate treasurer of 
  an industrial machinery producer termed the overall recovery of new 
  orders "spotty." One machinery equipment manufacturer felt that part 
  of the flatness of his order book was due to buyers holding back 
  orders until after the September machinery show in Chicago. New 
  orders at a tractor and crane manufacturer had edged up slightly 
  since early summer, but the backlog at this firm has been almost 
  completely eroded. A major steel maker located in Western New York 
  reported that demand for structural steel continued to languish. He 
  explained that the operating rate of his firm's upstate plant had 
  held near the company's average due to the strong demand for flat-rolled products. While some of the sluggishness in capital goods 
  production in the region is due to the sluggish recovery in national 
  business spending, a bank economist emphasized the maturity of the 
  region in this connection. As a result, this analyst felt that the 
  region's capital goods industries could be expected to lag behind 
  the national recovery in investment goods demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business inventories by and large appeared to be in relatively good 
  balance with sales. Most of our directors viewed the early summer 
  increases in inventories largely as the result of weaker than 
  expected sales, but none felt that the increases were excessive. 
  Buffalo directors observed that overall inventory levels were 
  somewhat low in relation to sales and expected moderate stock 
  building over the balance of the year. Retail respondents appeared 
  to be relatively satisfied with their sales-inventory balance but 
  reiterated that tight controls were being held on inventories. One 
  electrical machinery manufacturer, however, reported that 
  inventories were high and that his firm was in the process of 
  working them down.
     </p>
     <p>
      Second District bankers saw little evidence of a recovery in 
  business loan demand as yet in New York City, although some recovery 
  was observed in some outlying areas. For example, one director noted 
  signs of a sustained recovery in business loan demand in the 
  Binghamton area. Most of the Second District bankers contacted 
  outside of New York City expected loan demand to strengthen during 
  the next several months, but a majority of the New York City bankers 
  foresaw flat loan demand for some time to come.
