      Beige Book Report: Dallas

       July 21, 1971
      </strong>

       The presidents of large District savings and loan associations 
generally expect economic activity to pick up moderately in their 
areas. They reported that increases in construction activity have 
bolstered the demand for mortgage loans in recent months. Moreover, 
the greater amount of construction activity, and associated mortgage 
demand, is expected to continue through yearend. They also indicated 
that they have raised their lending rates recently and expect to 
raise them again before the year is out. The banking directors on 
the boards of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas similarly expect 
local economic conditions to improve, but, in addition, they 
anticipate that the rate of inflation and interest rates will 
increase over the next six months. They also feel loan demand will 
increase over this period.
      </p>
      <p>
       The presidents of savings and loan associations generally reported 
the demand for mortgage credit in their areas to be somewhat 
stronger than three months ago. Most attributed this strength to an 
increase in construction activity. But in spite of the number of new 
houses constructed, no buildup of unsold houses has been apparent. 
About half of the respondents reported that the number of unsold 
houses in their areas has remained about the same as three months 
ago, and a third indicated a decline in the number of unsold houses 
in their areas. Moreover, it was felt that these trends in 
construction activity, housing sales, and demand for mortgage credit 
will continue through the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the respondent savings and loan associations, current lending 
rates on 80 per cent conventional home mortgages range from 7 1/2 to 
8 3/4 per cent, averaging slightly less than 8 per cent. Most, 
however, ask for points above these rates. About half of the 
respondents reported that both their mortgage rates and the number 
of points they are asking are higher now than they were three months 
ago. Most of the remaining half reported that their rates and points 
have remained at about the same level as three months ago. The 
overwhelming majority reported no change in their minimum down-payment requirements or maximum maturities on mortgage loans 
compared with three months ago. About
       <br/>
       two-thirds of the respondents 
felt that rates on their 80 per cent conventional home mortgages 
would be from 1/4 to 1 per cent higher at yearend than they are 
currently.
      </p>
      <p>
       Savings and loan association presidents indicated that they are 
having either about the same or slightly less difficulty obtaining 
interim financing as they did three months ago. Most report that 
they are paying about the same rate for these funds as they did at 
that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The banking directors similarly expect the trend in economic 
activity in their areas to improve moderately, particularly in 
construction, industrial goods, and petroleum. But they also 
anticipate that both long- and short-term interest rates, and the 
rate of increase in consumer prices, will rise moderately over the 
balance of the year. Most banking directors feel that loan demand 
will pick up in the next six months, particularly in the consumer 
and construction areas. But they are also looking for the demand for 
agricultural loans to moderate further.
      </p>
      <p>
       Banking directors were also questioned about demand for lines of 
credit and their policies on certificates of deposit and purchases 
of municipal securities. Demands for lines of credit by their large 
business customers have not changed much recently, although a few 
indicated these demands have risen. Most of the recent lines of 
credit have been arranged on the basis of verbal agreements (no fees 
attached). Two-thirds of the respondents said that they have 
recently changed their policies for purchasing municipal securities. 
Of those changing their policies, more than half are buying less, 
mainly to purchase more liquid securities or because they feel that 
interest rates on municipals will increase. Those purchasing more 
municipals indicated they are picking up mostly shorter term issues. 
Only about half of the directors' banks are seeking funds by issuing 
long-term certificates of deposit and are paying from 5 to 5 7/8 per 
cent for six-month funds.
      </p>
      <p>
       District data continue to indicate that a modest economic recovery 
is taking place in this region. Texas industrial production 
continues to increase slowly. Registrations of new cars in Dallas, 
Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio in May were 7 per cent above 
the level for May last year. Similarly, department store sales for 
the four-week period ended July 10 were 6 per cent above the level 
for the corresponding period a year ago. However, Texas dropped its 
oil allowables 2.5 points to a level of 66.2 per cent for August in 
response to seasonal demand conditions. But the other District 
producing states were able to keep their allowables unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation for District agriculture continues uncertain to 
critical for several areas and enterprises because of drought. In 
some localities cotton plantings may be lost, and many cattle herds 
have been drastically cut back or totally eliminated due to feed 
shortages and lack of water. Most recently, the appearance of 
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis has plagued herds of horses.
