     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 15, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Views of head office board members and visiting branch board members 
were solicited prior to the July 9 board meeting in Dallas. The 
following conclusions emerged from our informal survey: (1) sales 
have been weakening for district businesses; (2) there is widespread 
evidence that merchandise is being sold below posted list prices; 
(3) the commercial paper market is regarded as relatively stable, 
but banks have accommodated and expect to further accommodate firms 
that have been borrowers in the commercial paper market; (4) large 
CD rates are up at some banks, with rates at a few small banks 
exceeding 9 percent; (5) corporate liquidity is still a major 
concern; and (6) loan demand remains strong, matching or exceeding 
seasonal expectations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The nonbankers noted that sales appeared to weaken somewhat in their 
industries in recent weeks. Despite the trend in sales, most 
respondents noted that their inventory situation had remained 
satisfactory so that no change in inventory policy had been 
necessary. There was an indication (confirmed by aggregate data for 
the region) that petroleum inventories were too high at present, 
even though sales of the petroleum industry have remained strong. 
Recent reductions have been made in district petroleum production 
allowables, particularly in Texas, to curtail crude petroleum 
mining. The petroleum inventory situation may also improve because a 
shortage of tankers and reduced Libyan production has caused some 
strengthening of domestic demand.
     </p>
     <p>
      The respondents were nearly unanimous in citing that
      <br/>
      price-cutting 
from posted list prices had occurred in their industries. It was 
further indicated that this practice has been on the increase in 
recent weeks. Price-cutting has probably been one response to the 
weakening sales reported in several industries. One district banker 
suggested that a form of price-cutting had been on the increase in 
the banking industry. This was occurring through the use of gift 
premiums, reducing the size of the minimum balance required to avoid 
a checking account service charge, and other innovative promotions 
to attract deposits.
     </p>
     <p>
      A series of questions were asked pertaining to recent developments 
in the commercial paper market. Nonbankers who have been active in 
the commercial paper market, either as issuers or as buyers, 
reported no change in recent weeks in their activity or in their 
policies toward the commercial paper market. Several bankers in the 
area, however, noted that they had recently accommodated borrowers 
who were in the commercial paper market. Of particular note was the 
recent accommodation by one banker of finance companies that were 
known to utilize the commercial paper market. In addition, several 
bankers mentioned that they had outstanding lines of credit to 
companies that were in the commercial paper market and anticipated 
some additional activation of these lines of credit in the near 
future.
     </p>
     <p>
      Banking respondents to our latest survey noted a generally strong 
loan demand. All reported loan demand to be either exceeding or 
matching seasonal expectations. The source of this loan demand is 
apparently from general business, but large real estate development 
projects were particularly singled out by one banker.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent change in Regulation Q rates for large denomination CD's 
with maturities of 30 to 89 days has brought mixed responses from 
district bankers. About half of our survey respondents reported that 
they had increased their offering rates (usually to the 7 1/2 - 8 
percent range, but exceeding 9 percent at a few small banks) while 
half reported they had not changed their rates. Of the bankers who 
had increased rates on CD's, only one reported any reduced reliance 
on sources of borrowed funds, such as Eurodollars, commercial paper, 
or federal funds. To the extent that additional funds are being 
attracted to district banks by the higher CD rates, it appears these 
funds are being utilized to make new loan or investment commitments 
and not to reduce reliance on borrowed sources of funds. Some 
bankers indicated that the recent lifting of CD rate ceilings had 
given a psychological lift to the financial community. At the same 
time, however, corporate liquidity remains a major concern of the 
bankers surveyed. One banker expressed particular concern about the 
liquidity position of smaller, closely held corporations.
