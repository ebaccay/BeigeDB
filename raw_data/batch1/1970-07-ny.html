      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 15, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      In the Second Federal Reserve District, Directors of the Federal 
Reserve Bank and other business executives saw some signs that 
prices were easing, indicated they believed the recent stretch-out 
of capital spending plans would continue into 1971, and expressed 
the opinion that, in general, inventories were higher than business 
firms desired. While it was thought the current strains in the 
financial markets did not pose a serious immediate threat to 
business activity, considerable concern was expressed regarding 
business liquidity.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only two of the Federal Reserve Bank Directors who attended the 
early July meetings at New York and Buffalo were aware of any price 
shading by manufacturers, but more directors mentioned other signs 
of an improvement in the overall price situation. These included 
announced price cuts, particularly at the retail level, as well as 
price shading at the retail level by giving the customer greater 
value. With regard to
      <br/>
      under-the-counter price adjustments, it was 
reported that Bethlehem Steel Corporation had taken a strong 
position against such a marketing practice. As for announced cuts by 
manufacturers, one director noted receiving an announcement of a 
three percent reduction in the price of cans for packaging 
beverages. At the retail level, there has been considerable price 
cutting by automobile dealers as well as by other retail outlets, 
with the aim of either reducing inventories or building sales 
volume.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail store sales reportedly were holding up well, except at downtown stores and during night shopping hours. Sales apparently were 
being bolstered by aggressive merchandising. The head of a large 
chain observed, however, that retail stores need an increase of 
three to three and one half percent in volume to bring profit up to 
last year's level. Contributing to this need were higher costs 
stemming from increases in wage rates, in shipping charges, and in 
shoplifting.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors were virtually unanimous in believing that the more 
cautious capital spending pattern that apparently has developed in 
recent months will continue into 1971. New programs were being "very 
carefully reviewed," and many projects were being slowed down or 
indefinitely deferred. However, projects for which commitments are 
too far along to be canceled or postponed are being completed, as 
probably will be projects designed to cut production costs and 
increase productivity. Although an upstate New York banker remarked 
that there were no signs of cutback in his area, he observed that 
most of the capital spending there was on construction for 
municipalities and school districts, for which firm contracts had 
been arranged "long ago." On the other hand, a community college 
construction project for which bids were recently obtained may have 
to be canceled because the bids are so far above the original 
estimates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The few comments made on the inventory situation suggested that 
inventories were higher than were desired. A New York banker 
commented that inventories in general are eight to ten percent above 
a year ago, and that increased inventories were particularly evident 
in the soft goods area. The chairman of a large manufacturing firm 
observed that inventories were high mainly because business "is not 
selling goods as fast as desired," although special factors such as 
the recent truckers' strike in Chicago had contributed to the 
buildup, as had "a new permanent inflation factor" that has been 
built into inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most directors seemed to believe the current strains in the 
financial markets did not pose a serious threat to business activity 
at the present time, although the head of a large New York City bank 
declared he thought there would be "adverse" effects, but was unable 
to judge whether these would be "serious." Despite the near-consensus that there was no immediate threat, a number of directors 
and other business executives did indicate concern regarding 
financial developments. A banker from upstate New York noted that 
many businessmen who have long-term financings in the offing are 
attempting to arrange standby intermediate or short-term credits as 
possible alternative solutions to their financing needs. An 
investment banker commented that his firm had been marketing four-to-five year securities for many clients, and that if inflation is 
not halted, he sees "an end to public financing of debt issues." A 
large retailer observed that small manufacturers were in serious 
shape with regard to liquidity; they cannot borrow as easily as very 
big concerns, and at the same time big retailers are slower in 
making payments to them than in the past, inasmuch as the discount 
for prompt payment is less than the cost of borrowing money. 
Customer payments to retail stores were also noted as slower than 
usual, The head of a New York academic institution declared the long 
decline in the stock market had cut gifts to private educational 
institutions and had drastically reduced the market value of 
holdings of endowed institutions. Finally, a Wall Street man 
"guessed" that only 300 of today's 500 New York Stock Exchange 
member firms would survive the next six months, but regarded 
mergers, which he believes will accelerate, as desirable.
     </p>
     <p>
      An upstate New York banker commented there is still "considerable" 
demand for credit in the Rochester area, particularly for real 
estate projects, but the head of a giant insurance company observed 
that the demand for "new money" was "somewhat depressed" and that 
requests for policy loans had "leveled." This insurance company, it 
was noted, is moving in the direction of real estate investments and 
equity participations. The chairman of a large mutual savings bank 
remarked, late in June, that although official figures indicate a 
recent pick-up in deposits at thrift institutions, there is no 
evidence of such a movement in New York City. He thought that most 
of the deposit money that was being withdrawn was probably going 
into bonds. He also indicated he was not sure his bank benefited 
from the use of merchandise premiums, and said he would favor their 
being banned by the supervisory authorities.
