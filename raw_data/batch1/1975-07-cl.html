      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The pace of economic activity in some sectors of the District is 
  continuing to improve, particularly retail sales of nondurable 
  goods, housing, and several manufacturing industries. Employment and 
  production are still sluggish in a number of areas of the industrial 
  sector, however. Some manufacturing firms have been liquidating 
  inventories at a rapid pace and plan to continue their inventory 
  reduction programs in the near future. Capital spending, in real 
  terms, is not expected to recover until next year.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major retail chain in the District reported unit sales of 
  nondurable goods picked up strongly during the past two months. 
  Strengthening of hard goods sales is expected later in the year. The 
  firm's buyers note prices for fall and winter merchandise have 
  declined. Price markdowns on apparel and white goods will be less 
  extensive than in recent months because inventories have been cut to 
  desired levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest report of Cleveland purchasing agents suggests that 
  production and new orders continued to decline in June at about the 
  same pace as in May. Inventory liquidation accelerated last month, 
  and employment and prices continued to decline. Those developments 
  are consistent with early returns from our June survey of District 
  manufacturers, except that our survey shows an increase in new 
  orders last month, the first gain since last August.
     </p>
     <p>
      A large producer of consumer packaging materials said orders have 
  improved in recent months. The firm's inventories rose through 
  April, and it plans to liquidate excess stocks until year-end. An 
  appliance industry supplier views its inventories of finished and 
  semi-finished goods as slightly above desired levels. A major 
  chemical firm reports its stocks of chemical products in balance 
  with sales, but plastics inventories are still high.
     </p>
     <p>
      A tire industry source said tire shipments to wholesalers and 
  retailers have recovered strongly. No further inventory liquidation 
  or price-cutting at the retail level is expected because dealer 
  inventories are low. (Shortly after reporting this item to us, the 
  tire firm announced a price increase averaging 5 percent on its 
  tires and tire products.) Tire producers plan to reduce inventories 
  for the remainder of the year by allowing tire production to 
  increase at a slower rate than sales.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the capital goods sector, economists from several machinery 
  companies said they do not foresee a recovery in real capital 
  spending until early 1976. One economist said cancellations of 
  machine tool orders appear to have run their course. New orders 
  received by his firm were level in June, following some improvement 
  in May. Another large machinery company has laid off workers at 
  three plastics machinery plants in Ohio. New orders for certain 
  types of gears have softened recently, according to a director in 
  the capital goods business: On the positive side, a major steel firm 
  reported it will spend $20 million for new plant and equipment in 
  one of the District's most obsolete steel producing areas. A 
  director in the office equipment business said sales turned up 
  sharply last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      A supplier to the truck industry said he foresaw no prospect for 
  recovery this year in the depressed market for heavy-duty trucks. 
  Inventories are very high. Sales of off-road heavy trucks used in 
  oil-drilling areas have picked up slightly, and the firm expects 
  more sales if oil prices are deregulated. The medium-sized truck 
  market is improving; light trucks are recovering significantly, 
  partly reflecting strength in demand for vehicles used on the farm 
  and for recreation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel industry sources said the decline in new orders has leveled 
  off during the past few months. However, recovery in steel output is 
  not expected until the fourth quarter. An economist with a major 
  steel company commented on the nationwide increase in May's new 
  orders for durable goods, which is largely attributable to a rise in 
  steel orders. Steel orders received in May, seasonally adjusted, may 
  be overstated because delivery is usually during the low shipping 
  month of July. Thus, May's increase in durable goods orders may be 
  more a reflection of inadequacies in the seasonal adjustment process 
  than changes in underlying market condition. Steel producers have 
  been offering price concessions to stimulate demand. Steel service 
  centers, which have far more inventory than needed to handle current 
  orders have also cut some prices. Inventories at steel mills are 
  near desired levels, but warehouses and steel users are expected to 
  continue cutting inventories into the fourth quarter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Executives from several oil companies based in the District reported 
  the nation's gasoline inventories are tight. They commented that 
  spot shortages could develop in the months ahead, particularly on 
  the East coast. Right now, oil refineries are maximizing gasoline 
  production and are raising prices to recover some past cost 
  increases. The major concern about the availability of petroleum 
  products is during the fall and winter. If the expected shortages of 
  natural gas occur, cutbacks of natural gas to industrial users will 
  force some companies to convert to fuel oil. This could cause 
  serious disruptions of petroleum product supplies. (As an indication 
  of impending natural gas shortages, a gas company recently announced 
  that it will cut off all natural gas to industries in Central 
  Kentucky effective November 1.)
     </p>
     <p>
      In the housing market, residential construction contracts continued 
  to recover in May. The economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank of 
  Cincinnati said preliminary data from their sample of savings and 
  loans indicate near-record deposit inflows during June. Loan 
  commitments have been rising, but a few savings and loans are still 
  cautious in their lending policies because of low liquidity and the 
  possibility of savings outflows later this year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several banks in the Fourth District have reported weak growth of 
  total demand deposits, which is a normal seasonal development in 
  this District.  Rapid increases in individual demand deposits have 
  been offset by declines in public deposits.
