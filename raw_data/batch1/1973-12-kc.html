      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 12, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The Tenth District economy appears to be slowing down. Loan demand 
has flattened or is declining; real retail sales are off vis--vis a 
year ago; and, the dislocations and depressing effects of the energy 
shortage are now clearly beginning to be felt. Retailers are 
pessimistic about the year ahead. Among District livestock feeders 
and bankers the prolonged period of lower meat animal prices is a 
source of increasing concern. In addition, a strike involving TWA 
has seriously affected the Kansas City economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       A six-week strike by TWA cabin attendants has resulted in a cutoff 
of much of the $12.8 million monthly payroll to the metropolitan 
area and reduced convention and tourist business by about 15 
percent, according to estimates of the City Development Department. 
In addition, the energy shortage has resulted in pilot layoffs to 
accommodate reduced flight scheduling. The decreased demand for 
standard-sized automobiles has led to layoffs for 6,600 workers at 
the local GM assembly plants as of December 17, and there are 
increased reports from small local manufacturers of shortages of 
petrochemical-based plastics which have caused them to curtail 
operations and reduce employment. Several rural school districts 
using natural gas on an interruptible basis have received notice of 
curtailment of supplies and have switched to alternate, but more 
expensive propane systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Department stores are ringing up Christmas sales at about last year 
s pace in dollar volume. Selling especially well are apparel items, 
and stay-at-home durables, such as stereos, and TVs do-it-yourself 
merchandise, and gardening equipment. While most store executives 
expect to finish the year strongly, many doubt that 1974 will be 
very good. Their pessimism in many cases stems from the energy 
crisis, which they think may require closing earlier, may discourage 
the driving shopper, and may interfere with shipments of merchandise 
to the stores.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from auto dealers show car buying behavior here to be 
similar to that for the nation as a whole. New and used 
intermediates are selling poorly; luxuries and compacts are moving 
well. Judging from the sample of those contacted, about half of the 
dealers would prefer rationing to an increase in the price of 
gasoline. Few would say how they felt about the year ahead, although 
one Buick dealer thought sales could be off as much as 50 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail sales and other business in the Kansas City metropolitan area 
cannot help but suffer from a continuation of the TWA strike. Not 
many months ago, the reports coming out of Wichita were especially 
rosy, thanks in part to a booming light aircraft industry. Now, 
however, the energy pinch on general aviation is having severe 
repercussions. In the District's western states of Colorado, New 
Mexico, and Wyoming, the skiing season is getting underway. If there 
is compliance with the voluntary controls, ski areas will surely be 
hurt, although it is too soon to tell by how much. As one of our 
Bank's skiers observed, "It now will take three or four hours longer 
for the bus to reach Colorado from Kansas City, so I end up with 
less skiing and more riding fatigue at the same price." Looking 
further into the future, regional analysts are observing that the 
probable loss in tourism in the western part of the District will be 
largely offset by the accelerated development of major deposits of 
oil shale, uranium, and coal in those states, although such help 
will be some time in coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Continuing a recent trend, farm prices declined another 1 1/2 
percent during the month ended November 15. Lower prices for cattle, 
calves, broilers, and soybeans contributed most to the decrease. 
This prolonged period of lower meat animal prices has caused much 
concern among livestock feeders and bankers in the District, since 
profits have fallen sharply. Several weeks ago, it was expected that 
beef slaughter rates would accelerate to year-earlier levels 
reflecting the buildup in numbers during the freeze period. Once 
this backlog was worked off, prices were expected to strengthen. 
Instead, slaughter rates have generally continued to run below year-ago levels, and the market is still receiving fleshy animals which 
has kept prices down longer than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also contributing to this phenomenon has been a widening of the 
farm-retail price spread on beef. Very little of the sharp decline 
in the farm price has been reflected at retail, which has resulted 
in a lackluster consumer demand for beef. Although some of this 
price stickiness can be justified by higher costs for labor, 
transportation, packaging, and electricity, the recent surge in beef 
margins seems unusually large under the Phase IV guidelines. 
Therefore, for a large part of the District's cattle industry, these 
developments, when combined with the uncertainty over the energy 
shortage, have greatly dimmed the outlook for the period ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tenth District bankers contacted report that total demand is either 
stable or declining., The only exception is one bank in the Kansas 
City area which says its loan demand is exceptionally strong. Our 
weekly reporting bank figures suggest an even weaker loan demand 
picture for the District than is indicated by our telephone survey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rates charged on loans by most banks appear to be uniform and 
unchanged from last month except for one bank whose rate was lowered 
and then raised to the previous level.
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture for deposits appears to be somewhat mixed throughout the 
Tenth District, with no pattern emerging between loan demand and 
total deposits. Most bankers also report CD rates below those of New 
York, some were experiencing small runoffs, and most expected CD 
rates to rise in the future.
