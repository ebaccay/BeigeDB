      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Confidence in the economic outlook in the Seventh District has 
strengthened in the past month. Consumers continue to spend at a 
faster pace. Employment is increasing and unemployment is 
decreasing. Tough bargaining is in prospect on major labor 
contracts. Some business firms have raised their projections of 
sales gains for 1976, and some are raising capital spending plans. 
Order backlogs are stabilizing. Supplies of goods are ample in all 
sectors, but upward price pressures persist for finished products. 
The sales outlook for both cars and trucks has improved. Farmland 
values are sharply higher. Interest rates on new corporate bonds and 
on mortgages have eased.
       </p>
       <p>
        The business atmosphere cannot be described as bullish, but the 
flagging confidence evident two months ago has been replaced with a 
less hesitant view of the future. More purchasing managers reported 
output, new orders, and backlogs to have improved in January. 
Projections of increases in sales of manufactured goods and services 
for 1976 either are being raised or are being stated with more 
assurance. A quarterly survey of consumer confidence in the Chicago 
area, just released, showed a surge to the highest level in three 
years, after having fallen back last time. The upswing in the stock 
market and the decline in interest rates since the turn of the year 
were especially welcomed because these developments were unexpected. 
There are many comments that Congress, the Administration, and the 
Federal Reserve "will not let the economy falter in an election 
year."
       </p>
       <p>
        The stronger tone of retail sales noted in the Christmas period has 
continued in January and February. The list of products that are 
going well has broadened and includes apparel, auto supplies, 
furniture, appliances, recreational vehicles, truck-vans, and 
Citizens' Band radios. A producer of garbage disposal units is 
producing "full blast" again after a severe drop last year. Retail 
inventories generally seem in line. However, recent household goods 
trade shows in Chicago have brought an excellent response suggesting 
that many retailers are planning to restock in expectation of 
further growth in consumer outlays. Consumers are using installment 
credit more freely, and delinquencies and write-offs have improved. 
Loans on new cars are being held at three years, except for 
exceptionally good risks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Job markets continue to improve gradually, but unemployment remains 
very burdensome in the inner cities. Current and prospective labor 
negotiations are uppermost in the minds of many executives. A major 
airline was well pleased with a recent settlement that provides a 
first year wage boost of "only" 8.5 percent. The Teamsters are 
starting talks this week in Chicago. As before, the Chicago union is 
bargaining separately and is expected to set the pace. (Initial 
Teamster demands are very large.) The UAW is pressing for COLA 
increases for pensioners. An appliance union demands "30 and out," 
which management strongly opposes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the industries that have raised sales projections for 1976 
recently are motor vehicles, steel, and airlines. An oil company 
expects a 6.5 percent rise in total petroleum product sales, 
following a 2 percent decline last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among firms that have raised capital spending plans for 1976 
recently are motor vehicles, electric utilities, and chemicals. Oil 
companies say they are cutting back. Machine tool bookings are still 
very weak, but some producers have substantial backlogs. Increased 
sales of some smaller capital goods may be satisfied from field 
stocks for several months. Heavy construction equipment sales 
dropped off sharply late in the fourth quarter and are not expected 
to recover soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Output schedules for trucks, including heavy trucks, have been 
raised substantially recently, but from very low levels. Auto 
companies are pressing programs to offer broader lines of light-weight carsâ€”under 3,500 pounds. There has been an unusual amount of 
juggling of auto output schedules recently to adjust unbalanced 
inventories to buyer tastes, but total assembly schedules have been 
maintained and the tendency has been to raise sights on sales for 
the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inflows of savings to S&amp;Ls have continued at advanced levels. Loan 
commitments are being made more freely and terms are easing. At 
least one Chicago area S&amp;L is offering 80 percent, 30-year loans, at 
8.5 percent, plus "two points." Most loans are at 8.75 to 9 percent, 
down slightly in recent months. Builders and lenders maintain that 
most proposed new apartment projects do not offer prospects for 
profits at present levels of rents. Rents on existing apartments are 
under upward pressure, partly because of sharply higher costs of 
fuel and maintenance.
       </p>
       <p>
        District analysts expect food prices to rise at a faster pace in the 
second quarter more than offsetting a slowdown in the first quarter 
associated with declines in prices of cattle and processed foods 
late last year and early in 1976. Cuts in wholesale prices of 
processed fruits and vegetables are not fully reflected at the 
retail level. Fertilizer inventories are heavy and prices have 
declined recently. Farm equipment sales are expected to be larger 
this year. This Bank's survey of farmland values shows further 
increases in the fourth quarter to levels 22 percent above last year 
on average. Credit conditions at rural banks are much improved this 
year, because of good deposit growth and agricultural loan 
repayments.
