      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 14, 1974
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       The District's economy shows a mixed bag of pluses and minuses, 
according to the most recent reading. The situation for cattle 
producers is now considered more favorable than previous reports 
indicated. Bank lending remains strong in Tennessee despite the 
state's 10 percent usury ceiling. Residential building remains very 
weak. North Georgia's carpet industry is beginning to feel the 
effects of the decline in construction. Activity at four of the 
District's major ports is up over year-ago levels. Tourism continues 
to soar, after being depressed by gasoline shortages earlier in the 
year. Several large contracts have recently been awarded to District 
industries. Spending on pollution control in the region remains 
significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reports from several District bankers indicate that conditions have 
brightened recently for the region's livestock producers. Rains have 
revived pastures somewhat and, for the time being, have reduced the 
need for purchasing high-cost supplemental feeds. Some improvement 
in cattle prices has brightened prospects of cattlemen, eventually 
succeeding in disposing of their unusually large calf inventories at 
favorable prices. Cattle loans continue to be renewed and extended 
to prevent growers from having to sell on depressed markets. Bankers 
are now more optimistic that these loans will be repaid from cattle 
receipts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crop reports are much improved by the recent substantial rainfall. 
Most District farmers stand to benefit from good yields and the high 
prices caused by drought damage to crops in other parts of the 
country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tennessee's 10 percent usury ceiling has apparently had little 
impact on reducing bank lending. Large weekly reporting banks report 
increases in business and consumer installment loans as well as 
lending to nonbank financial institutions. Real estate lending shows 
the only weakness. Apparently, Tennessee banks are able to skirt the 
usury ceilings in some instances by upping compensating balance 
requirements. Some large Tennessee bank holding companies did have a 
decline in second-quarter earnings, however, which may be partially 
related to the state's usury law. Many Tennessee banks, believing 
interest rates have peaked, are shortening the maturity structure of 
their liabilities by shifting from CDs to the Federal funds market.
      </p>
      <p>
       Residential building remains very weak in the District. Latest 
information indicates increased outflows from savings and loan 
institutions. One bright spot is the Atlanta apartment market. 
Atlanta was overbuilt with apartments a year ago, but now there is a 
shortage partly because of the high price of single-family 
dwellings. This may also provide good news for the condominium 
market, which had come to a near standstill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The decline in residential construction is beginning to affect north 
Georgia's carpet industry. According to one area banker, not only is 
carpet demand dropping off, but many materials are still difficult 
to obtain. The net result has been reductions in production and 
employment. This banker indicated that the demand for inventory 
loans by carpet manufacturers is up, with increased prices of raw 
materials given as the reason. There has been little, if any, demand 
for bank funds for capital expansion by the carpet industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ports in New Orleans, Mobile, Jacksonville, and Palm Beach reported 
increases in tonnage shipped recently. Mobile had the third highest 
month in the port's history. The first Russian Merchant ship to call 
at the Savannah, Georgia, port has docked there to load wood pulp 
and cellulose for export to Europe and Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tourism has remained strong. Alabama' s second largest industry is 
tourism, and it may receive a shot in the arm as eight welcome 
stations are to be built along Alabama's borders to "sell" the state 
as a vacation spot. Florida is having a good summer as earlier 
reported. Disney World and Cypress Gardens are doing well. Two major 
tourist attractions in the Atlanta area have reported increases in 
visitors from a year ago. Atlanta' s convention business is booming, 
with activity coming in from all over the world. At the present 
time, there are around 16,000 hotel and motel rooms and, in two 
years, the number will be increased to around 26,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       Representatives from an Atlanta area investment house indicated that 
they have received feelers from Arabs about possible investment in 
District income-producing property; they are currently negotiating 
several investments in the Atlanta area.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several new contracts have been awarded to District industries. 
Textron's Bell Aerospace Division of Michoud, Louisiana, has been 
awarded a $36 million contract to conduct an advanced development 
program for the Navy's proposed 2,000 ton, high-speed surface effect 
ship. Rohn Industries of Winder, Georgia, received a $30 million 
contract from the United States Department of Transportation to 
build seven high-speed turbo trains for Amtrak. Lockheed, Georgia, 
received a $26 million contract for five aircraft for the Canadian 
Armed Forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spending on environmental protection and pollution control 
continues. to be a sizable portion of District investment spending. 
Miami and Tampa, Florida, received two of the largest grants made by 
the Environmental Protection Agency to help clean up water 
pollution. Miami received $41 million; Tampa received $34 million. 
The Tennessee Valley Authority will invest a record $180 million 
this year on pollution-control projects at ten power plants.
