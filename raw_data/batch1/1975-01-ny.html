      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 15, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Views expressed by Second District directors, retailers, and other 
  business leaders who were contacted recently point to a further 
  slowing in business activity over the past month. Retail sales in 
  general have been sluggish, although strengthening somewhat 
  recently; inventories are at, or approaching, excessive levels; and 
  unemployment is on the rise. At the same time, there has been no 
  lessening of liquidity pressures.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail sales over the holiday season were on the weak side but in 
  many cases no worse than the relatively pessimistic expectations. A 
  survey of the seven leading New York City department stores by a 
  local newspaper revealed that, in dollar terms, December sales by 
  these stores within the City had been slightly below those of 
  December of 1973, implying a significant decline in physical volume. 
  Sales of major appliances and other durable goods in general were 
  particularly weak. Dollar sales at those stores' suburban branches, 
  however, were slightly above last year's. The president of a large 
  Rochester department store reported sales by his firm to be in line 
  with his expectations that they would run at about the same level as 
  a year ago in dollar terms. Similarly, a senior official of a large 
  department store chain reported that dollar sales at the firm's 
  western New York affiliates in November and December were about 
  equal to those of the year earlier period, but that physical volume 
  was about 4 percent lower than during November-December 1973.
     </p>
     <p>
      The retail sales picture appears to have brightened somewhat in 
  recent weeks, however, in response to both pre-Christmas and the 
  usual post-holiday sales. Thus, the president of a nationwide retail 
  firm stated that business during most of the Christmas buying season 
  ran significantly below expectations, but that as a result of heavy 
  promotional activities the season had ended on a strong note, with 
  good traffic continuing after Christmas. A senior official of a 
  large New York City department store similarly reported that after a 
  slow start, business had been brisk in the final days of the holiday 
  season, a development also reported by several other retailers. 
  Among others, the president of another large New York department 
  store with branches in the suburbs stated that Christmas sales had 
  been up to his expectations and that so far his firm's January sales 
  had been "producing business" and were heavier than in January 1973.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the view of several respondents, the reduction in consumer demand 
  and the accompanying more competitive selling practices have been 
  reflected in some evidence of downward pressures on prices of 
  finished goods. One retailer stated that price reductions for 
  various items were legion within the retail industry, generally due 
  to overproduction by manufacturers of dry goods, appliances and 
  similar items, and to the desire to reduce inventories. The 
  respondents, however, did not regard the decline in a number of raw 
  material prices as having as yet had a significant influence on the 
  price of finished goods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding inventory positions, the president of the nationwide 
  retail firm mentioned above reported that his firm had been 
  overstocked for several months and was making major efforts to get 
  its inventories into line with consumer demand. A senior official of 
  a multinational chemical concern stated that while inventories had 
  not yet built to excessive levels, he expected increases during the 
  first half of 1975. The chairman of a large New York City bank 
  looked for inventories to rise sharply in response to falling sales. 
  Several other respondents, however, felt that inventories remained 
  at an acceptable level.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District unemployment situation deteriorated further during the 
  past month, particularly in the New York City area and in Buffalo. 
  The November jobless rate in New York State rose to 6.6 percent, and 
  to 7.4 percent in New York City. December figures are expected to 
  show a substantial further rise. There have been frequent reports of 
  layoffs by major firms in various parts of the District, and in 
  recent weeks new claims for unemployment insurance benefits in New 
  York State have been among the highest in the nation. However, the 
  majority of the respondents commenting on the subject as yet 
  discerned little or no easing of the shortage of skilled workers or 
  of highly qualified managerial employees. Some respondents, however, 
  did see, or expected to see shortly, some easing in the situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding liquidity positions, none of the respondents reported any 
  signs of easing in pressures thus far. On the contrary, the majority 
  of the Buffalo directors felt that conditions were worsening. 
  Several of these directors noted that in view of the 
  unattractiveness of the bond and equity markets and the lack of 
  access to national money markets generally, many businesses in their 
  area were seeking commercial bank loans for working capital or to, 
  at least temporarily, finance capital expansion. Others cited the 
  substantial increase in delinquencies on accounts receivables, and 
  the increase in the number of bankruptcies.
