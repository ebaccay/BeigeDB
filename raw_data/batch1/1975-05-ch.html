      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic prospects in the Seventh District continue to be highly 
  uncertain. The best that can be said is that the rate of decline in 
  general activity has slowed. Residential construction has not 
  revived significantly, despite heavy savings inflows to S&amp;Ls. 
  Capital equipment output, in total, appears to be in the opening 
  stages of a long and, probably, steep decline. Desired inventory 
  reductions at the manufacturing level, overall, are far from 
  complete. Consumers' outlays on virtually all hard goods remain at 
  very depressed levels. Prospects for a substantial increase in crop 
  harvests are generally good, although rains have delayed some 
  plantings. Competitive forces are dampening price increases in the 
  manufacturing sector. Many prices have declined recently, most 
  notably prices of processed foods, at both the wholesale and retail 
  levels. Meat prices, however, have increased sharply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because of the Seventh District's concentration on durable goods 
  manufacturing, this region probably has been hit harder by the 
  recession than the nation generally—just as the upsurge in activity 
  was more pronounced here. Order backlogs of most firms have declined 
  sharply. Order cancellations have been heavy, partly reflecting the 
  reductions in lead times that have removed the inventive for 
  anticipatory ordering. Many firms have instituted stringent cost-cutting programs, and have deferred or stretched out capital 
  spending programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      Perhaps the greatest disappointment of recent weeks has been the 
  lack of significant improvement in residential and commercial 
  building, which remains at extremely depressed levels. Most S&amp;Ls 
  have used the heavy savings inflows to repay debt and rebuild 
  liquidity. Forward mortgage commitments are virtually unobtainable 
  in Illinois, where the usury rate is scheduled to drop from 9.5 to 8 
  percent at midyear. Throughout the district, sales of new or 
  existing homes have remained very slow. Chicago area homebuilding 
  permits have been at the lowest level since World War II.
     </p>
     <p>
      Some builders have announced reductions in house prices of 10 
  percent or more, despite rising costs, to attract customers. Recent 
  bids on new construction projects often have been below estimates, 
  and many more bids are being received on proposed projects. There is 
  evidence of a pickup in repair and remodeling work, perhaps in lieu 
  of new construction. Early indications that building trades unions 
  would moderate their demands significantly, have given way to new 
  militancy in the face of very heavy unemployment. Chicago area 
  painters have just gone on strike after rejecting a 6.6 percent pay 
  boost.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tax credit on home purchases has not been of much help, partly 
  because of the complicated rules. Similarly, the increase in the 
  investment tax credit is not a powerful incentive because most 
  industries have idle facilities. Moreover, three percentage points 
  added to the tax credit is only a partial offset to increases of 20 
  to 30 percent or more in prices of equipment in the past 12 to 15 
  months.
     </p>
     <p>
      Large retailers are curtailing expansion plans, partly reflecting 
  reduced residential building. Steel producers are moving ahead with 
  basic expansion programs, despite a sharply reduced level of new 
  orders and renewed concern over imports. Demand for most types of 
  equipment for mining, heavy construction, and water and sewer 
  projects remains excellent. Sales of the largest farm tractors and 
  combines also remain very strong. However, demand for lighter 
  construction and farm equipment, and for most types of industrial 
  equipment is off sharply. Sales of large trucks remain very poor and 
  railroads are said to be canceling orders for equipment. Foreign 
  demand for various equipment is very good, especially from the 
  Communist bloc, OPEC nations, and Germany. Favorable exchange rates 
  encourage sales abroad.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most consumers continue to spend very cautiously. Some producers of 
  laundry equipment and TV sets have announced callbacks of laid-off 
  workers, but any revival of sales has been modest. Demand has 
  remained very weak for mobile homes, RVs, air conditioners, pleasure 
  boats, lawn and garden machines, and, of course, autos (except for 
  imports and specialty and luxury models). Consumers have slowed 
  purchases of processed foods this year. Relatively large inventories 
  of these foods at the wholesale level are associated with price 
  reductions averaging about 10 percent at Chicago area food chains.
     </p>
     <p>
      Spring plantings are on schedule, or ahead of schedule, in Illinois 
  and Indiana. Rains have delayed plantings in Iowa, however, and 
  continuance of wet conditions past mid-May could reduce prospective 
  yields there. Farmers are buying equipment more cautiously. Prices 
  of farmland in the district rose 2 percent, on average, in the first 
  quarter, according to bankers' reports, the smallest quarterly rise 
  in three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      A final note: There is no lack of statements of general views that 
  the recession has bottomed out, and that the second half will see 
  significant real gains in activity. These encouraging 
  generalizations usually are buttressed by references to tax 
  reductions, dampened inflation, easing of supplies, inventory 
  liquidations, slower rates of decline in new orders, large savings 
  inflows, and lessened consumer pessimism indicated by surveys. But 
  very little solid evidence of improvements in particular types of 
  activity can be adduced, and some manufacturing sectors have only 
  begun to slide off.
