      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the District deteriorated significantly last 
  month, and further weakness is expected. Layoffs and shortened 
  workweeks are widespread. It appears many industries are liquidating 
  inventories, although some steel and machine tool firms say they 
  need to rebuild stocks. Signs of weakness are spreading in the 
  capital goods sector, and demand for steel is softening. S&amp;Ls 
  continue to have savings inflows, but mortgage loan demand is weak 
  and housing is still declining.
     </p>
     <p>
      Early returns from our monthly survey of District manufacturers 
  indicate a further sharp deterioration in business during January. 
  Many companies reported declines in new orders, shipments, and 
  backlogs; and inventory liquidation, underway last month, apparently 
  continued. The proportion of firms paying higher prices eased for 
  the fourth consecutive month. One clothing manufacturer said sales 
  and new orders are so low, and inventories so high, that it is not 
  purchasing and therefore cannot take advantage of lower prices 
  quoted by its suppliers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment and hours worked continued to drop in January, and 
  unemployment seems likely to rise further in February. Several large 
  firms announced temporary or indefinite layoffs beginning in late 
  January or February. In the Pittsburgh area, a 40 percent reduction 
  in the amount of natural gas available for industrial use (effective 
  January 1) has caused some layoffs—concentrated in the stone, clay 
  and glass industries. Other firms are shortening workweeks. In the 
  Akron area, for example, many tire company employees who usually 
  work a
      <br/>
      6-day week of 6-hour days have gone to a 5-day week and some 
  to 4-day and even 3-day weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      An economist for a major tire company reports that further weakened 
  sales have lifted inventories of tires to a 9-month supply compared 
  with 6 months recently. Production has finally been cut below sales 
  and additional layoffs are likely, although the worst seems to be 
  over. Demand for chemical products has dropped sharply since 
  November, resulting in a rapid buildup of stocks. Production has 
  been cut in line with reduced sales and output appears to be 
  leveling off. One firm intends to reduce planned 1975 capital 
  spending by stretching out some programs. The firm wants to avoid 
  any further depression of its debt-equity ratio.
     </p>
     <p>
      Signs of weakening in the capital goods sector are spreading. A 
  major heavy-duty truck manufacturer in Cleveland recently closed its 
  plant for a week, and reopened with operations reduced by one-third. 
  Truck suppliers and some machinery firms are laying off workers. A 
  major machine tool company in Cleveland said cancelled machine tool 
  orders exceeded new orders in January for the third consecutive 
  month. The firm's economist noted that backlogs through mid-1976 and 
  the need for inventory rebuilding preclude any decline in 
  employment. This economist, a highly regarded analyst of capital 
  spending, added that he expects the rate of decline in real capital 
  spending to continue during the first half and to increase in the 
  second half.
     </p>
     <p>
      Another major machine tool producer reported that new orders have 
  weakened recently but are still running close to the firm's shipping 
  rate. Although cancellations have increased, back orders stand at 15 
  to 18 months. The firm has not changed its capital spending plans. 
  Its inventories have improved but are still unbalanced, partly 
  because of continued shortages of some materials, notably castings. 
  This firm is still hiring and working a 48-hour week.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major electronic and printing press producer reports orders for 
  presses fell sharply in January following a strong volume of 
  bookings throughout the second half of 1974. The decline was 
  attributed to uncertainties over the investment tax credit. Demand 
  for the firm's electronics products, such as radio and TV 
  broadcasting equipment and computer components, is still strong, 
  with January bookings 10 percent above December 1974 levels. Capital 
  spending plans for 1975 have not been curtailed because of the 
  recession, although the firm may stretch out as much as $1 million 
  of its $16 million increase planned for this year. Stocks are being 
  reduced gradually and are in better balance than they were at the 
  end of the third quarter. No drastic cutbacks in stocks are 
  anticipated because order backlog is 15-20 percent higher than last
  year.
     </p>
     <p>
      The treasurer of a multinational firm that produces office equipment 
  reported orders have fallen sharply recently, from both domestic and 
  foreign sources. The firm has laid off about 1,000 of its 16,000 
  workers since December 1 because of declining sales and large 
  inventories. Inventories are considered excessive, but production is 
  thought to be near the bottom of a "U"-shaped pattern.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for steel is weakening, according to three major steel firms. 
  Customers are canceling or deferring delivery on old orders, and 
  pushing back delivery on new orders. However, there is still 
  substantial strength in the steel industry stemming largely from 
  oil, coal mining, railroad, and farm equipment producers. One steel 
  firm heavily dependent on the automotive and appliance industries 
  has begun laying off workers and reducing the workweek. Steel output 
  in Cleveland has declined recently because a blast furnace at one 
  mill cracked last month. It will probably be March before repairs 
  are completed. The firm is receiving poor quality metallurgical coal 
  resulting in production inefficiencies. Another large steel firm 
  reports bottlenecks in production because of natural gas shortages 
  and because they have operated at full capacity for 2 years without 
  sufficient maintenance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Demand for mortgage loans is seasonally weak, according to some 
  banks and S&amp;Ls in Cleveland. Officers attribute weak loan demand in 
  part to a lack of consumer confidence but also apparently to little 
  easing in mortgage terms. One major bank requires 40 percent down on 
  a 20-year loan, with an interest rate of 9 1/4 percent. Loans with 
  less than 40 percent down are not encouraged. In contrast, some S&amp;Ls 
  are actively soliciting mortgage loans, following 3 successive 
  months of net deposit growth. A $150 million deposit institution 
  that offers a variable rate mortgage is actively seeking loans but 
  has found fewer takers than it wants. Housing starts continue to 
  plummet.
