      Beige Book Report: Philadelphia
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       August 11, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Economic conditions in the Third District are improving, but the 
  pace of improvement is somewhat uneven. Retail activity is mixed, 
  while the manufacturing sector continues to expand. New orders, 
  shipments, and employment are higher this month, while inventories 
  in manufacturing are lower. The longer term outlook in both 
  retailing and manufacturing is still optimistic but less so than in 
  previous months. Reports of higher prices are less widespread than 
  in July. There is brisk activity in the market for existing housing 
  but very little recovery in new construction. Bankers report that 
  weakness in corporate loan demand is spurring requests by business 
  borrowers for concessions on loan terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      District manufacturers, responding to the latest business outlook 
  survey, report a higher level of activity than last month. One third 
  of the businessmen surveyed see an improvement in overall business 
  conditions. Increases in new orders are reported by two fifths of 
  those polled, and a similar proportion say that shipments have 
  increased as well. Neither of these indicators showed any increase 
  last month. At the same time, work forces are larger at 16 percent 
  of the firms surveyed, while the average workweek is unchanged. One 
  key area showing no increase is inventories, which are slightly 
  lower this month after holding steady in July.
     </p>
     <p>
      The outlook in manufacturing for the next six months is for further 
  expansion, although projections of gains are not so widespread as in 
  previous surveys. Of the executives polled, three out of five look 
  for better business conditions over the next two quarters. This is 
  down from last month, when three out of four respondents projected 
  improvement six months out, and well below the monthly average (four 
  out of five) for the first seven months of this year. Specific gains 
  are expected in new orders, shipments, and employment, but for each 
  of these barometers the proportion of respondents anticipating 
  increases is substantially below the levels of the recent past. In 
  addition to expansion in these categories, the average workweek and 
  inventories are each expected to increase over the period. At the 
  same time, 40 percent of the manufacturers surveyed plan to hike 
  their spending for plant and equipment, up somewhat from last month.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to prices, 46 percent of the respondents indicate that 
  they are paying higher prices for their supplies. This is down from 
  last month when 57 percent were reporting increases. At the same 
  time, 27 percent report price hikes for their finished products, 
  about the same as in July. By February, roughly three out of four 
  expect to be paying more for their inputs and charging higher prices 
  for the products they sell. Retailers report only slight price 
  increases by suppliers and attribute this, in part, to the 
  uncertainty about retail sales prospects down the road.
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports on area retail activity are mixed. Some merchants indicate 
  that current sales show little or no growth over the same period 
  last year, while others note increases of 9 to 10 percent. Almost 
  all of the retailers contacted, including some with 9 to 10 percent 
  gains, say that current sales volumes are falling short of the 
  levels they expected.
     </p>
     <p>
      Major appliances and big-ticket furniture items are reported to be 
  particularly soft, while fashion accessories and recreational 
  equipment are singled out as strong sellers. Merchants note that 
  price markdowns on seasonal items occurred earlier than usual this 
  year, and they feel that these have helped generate a sizable chunk 
  of current sales. According to one retailer, "we've reduced prices 
  on seasonal items in the latest period in hopes of avoiding bigger 
  markdowns in the next period". All of the retailers contacted look 
  for a strong September, but several are reconsidering their 
  prospects and buying plans for later in the year. According to one 
  merchant, "we used to be cocky about the fallâ€”now we're just 
  confident". Yet another feels that, "if our December sales this year 
  just equal last year's, we'll have nothing to cry about".
     </p>
     <p>
      The residential housing market in the area is reported to be very 
  active for existing housing, but only slight recovery is taking 
  place in new construction. There are signs that the rental market in 
  the area is tightening somewhat, which may open the way for a few 
  new multifamily units. By and large, however, the outlook is for no 
  substantial increase in new construction over the near term. One 
  mutual savings bank official notes that availability of funds is 
  good and that mortgage rates have declined recently. This official 
  expects rates to decline further in the near future before moving 
  upward by late fall. He even sees the possibility, although remote, 
  of a drop in rates paid on savings if short-term money market rates 
  decline further.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers in the District report that, while consumer loans are 
  increasing, business loan volume remains weak. Most banks are 
  attempting to attract consumer business through either merchandise 
  promotions, lower rates, or extended maturities. The results, 
  however, are "not as good as expected". On the business side, there 
  are no reported signs of any pickup in loan demand. Several bankers 
  do note slightly increased pressure from corporate customers for 
  concessions on loan terms. More requests for fixed rates, as well as 
  early attempts to renegotiate terms on revolving credits, are 
  reported. For the most part, bankers indicate that these requests 
  have been denied. Several bankers feel, however, that, if business 
  loan demand remains weak, they may find it more difficult to deny 
  such requests in the future.
