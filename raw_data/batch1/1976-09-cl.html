     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Cleveland
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       September 15, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in the Fourth District, as in the nation, continues at the 
  moderated pace of the past few months. Directors, financial officers 
  and economists, although somewhat more skeptical than they were a 
  few months ago, are still generally optimistic that recovery will be 
  sustained into 1977. Skepticism in part reflects erratic behavior in 
  consumer spending, modest revival in capital goods and some scaling 
  down in steel orders and output.
     </p>
     <p>
      Directors and financial officers appear somewhat apprehensive over 
  prospects for the economy, but economists expect recovery in real 
  GNP to continue at a rate of 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 percent during 1977. 
  Directors view the recovery as from "very healthy" to moderate. They 
  expect errors in projections to be on the downside. Economists 
  appear less concerned that recovery will slow further from the pace 
  of recent months. Except for an economist associated with a retail 
  chain, there is little fear that the recovery will peak in 1977. 
  Economists view recent weaknesses in retail sales and steel as 
  transitory and the slower pace of output in recent months as typical 
  for the second year of the recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Erratic behavior of consumer spending is one of the key 
  uncertainties expressed by some of the directors and economists in 
  the District. Shifting in consumer spending from autos and apparel 
  to services, travel and food was cited by some respondents to 
  explain recent consumer behavior. Sales of food, meat, laundry and 
  personal care items did not slump in recent months, according to 
  directors and economists associated with food processing and 
  consumer goods manufacturers. Home remodeling continues very strong, 
  according to a director with a major producer of those products. 
  Another director and manufacturer of consumer housewares expected 
  retail sales to remain stable in the months ahead. Most of the
  concern and uncertainty comes from retailers of department store 
  goods. An economist with a national department store chain noted 
  that apparel sales did not pickup in August and expressed concern 
  that the slump in real GAF sales has been caused by a continued 
  squeeze on consumer purchasing power. A director with a national 
  retail chain noted that the slowdown in retail sales has been 
  widespread and has caused an unanticipated buildup in inventories.
     </p>
     <p>
      Recovery in capital goods continues to be gradual and spotty, and 
  comments from directors and economists with these producers tend to 
  reflect different patterns in timing and magnitude of recovery in 
  their respective industries. Orders for machine-cutting tools rose 
  about 70 percent so far this year compared with the same period last 
  year, but backlogs are still not rising, according to one major tool 
  producer. Orders for another large tool builder were up sharply in 
  July and August, to a level nearly double their average for the 
  first half of 1976; but this volume is still about 75 percent of 
  their desired operating rate. A major supplier to heavy-duty truck 
  producers notes its orders have gains strength since the trough 
  early this year. Orders rose 10 percent in recent months, largely 
  because inventory liquidation of heavy-duty trucks is finally over 
  and inventories are back to a normal level. A major bearing producer 
  and supplier to capital goods firms notes its orders from railroad 
  and construction machinery firms bottomed out in recent months, but 
  there is yet no evidence of an upturn. The decline in orders for 
  some type of construction machinery, such as wheel loaders and 
  bulldozers bottomed out last spring, and demand is "just limping 
  along," according to one economist. Demand is expected to improve 
  gradually during the balance of this year but is not expected to 
  recover to previous peaks during this business expansion. Another 
  official with a capital goods firm that produces hydraulic 
  excavators and cranes also sees little prospect for any significant 
  improvement over the next year because of high inventories held by 
  distributors, lack of funds for sanitation, waterworks and other 
  public construction, and squeezed profit margins that prevent 
  contractors from purchasing new construction machinery. Bids for 
  heavy construction work are still running below a year-ago, and 
  contractors are frequently bidding below engineer costs in order to 
  get business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The recent slide in steel output has reduced utilization of capacity 
  to nearly 85 percent of capacity, compared with the second quarter 
  average of close to 90 percent. Steel producers have lowered their 
  estimates of output for the balance of this year to an 80-85 percent 
  of capacity range. Demand for hot-rolled steel products, which some 
  producers were informally allocating last quarter, has softened; one 
  economist commented that the psychology of steel buyers shifted 
  rapidly from fear of shortage to fear of excess inventories. 
  Rescinding of a schedule of price increases on October 1, price 
  hedging that ballooned orders for hot-rolled products last quarter, 
  and lagging revival in capital goods are among reasons cited for 
  scaling down of projections for steel production next quarter. On 
  the other hand, steel economists were not apprehensive that the 
  overall recovery would soon peak, and still expect real growth in 
  1977 at about 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 percent. One economist expects the 
  industry to operate at 90 to 95 percent of capacity during the first 
  half of 1977 but commented that shortages of steel are unlikely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production in the rubber industry is expected to reach about 75 
  percent of capacity in the first month of resumption in work, 90 
  percent in the second month and 100 percent in the third month, 
  according to an economist with a major tire producer. Therefore, 
  spot shortages may appear, especially for snow tires.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers generally seem to express less concern over shortages 
  than they did a few months ago when the pace of recovery was more 
  rapid. Capacity for a variety of capital goods appears more than 
  ample at least through 1977, although some spot shortages, such as 
  castings, can develop as machinery production approaches higher 
  utilization rates. Some chemical products, including polyvinyl 
  chloride, polypropylene, and chlorine, now in tight supply, could be 
  in short supply by yearend if demand continues to strengthen as much 
  as it has in recent months.
     </p>
     <p>
      A small sample of savings and loan associations in the District 
  shows savings inflows during August slowed, and mortgage lending and 
  mortgage terms were relatively unchanged from July. Liquidity of 
  associations was somewhat lower than in July, as some S&amp;Ls stepped 
  up borrowing from FHLBB, partly because deposit flows during the 
  summer months were less than needed to meet commitments.
