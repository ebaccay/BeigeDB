      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 14, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Deficit financing by the Treasury is adversely impacting on 
  borrowing by district firms. This conclusion was reached in a survey 
  of corporate financial officers who, for the most part, described 
  debt markets as in such poor condition that new offerings are not 
  even being considered. Consequently, some expansion projects are 
  being postponed, and a few companies are resorting to private 
  placement of securities. Some firms also warned of continued 
  shortages of capital during the anticipated economic recovery.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several firms that have recently sold bonds had to restructure their 
  issues to improve marketability. A manufacturer of building 
  materials, for example, shortened the maturity of a recent issue 
  from 20 to eight years and marketed only 80 percent of the planned 
  issue. And another large corporation recently announced a $250 
  million offering at 9.25 percent—substantially greater than the 
  yield it had planned just a few months ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      Only one firm surveyed had canceled a proposed debt issue. That 
  firm, a major oil company, planned to use the funds to complete a 
  refinery. Now funds for the project are being borrowed on a short-term basis—both through the commercial paper market and bank 
  financing. But a representative of the firm said that unless bond 
  markets improve, the company will have to postpone future expansion 
  projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      Corporate treasurers expect businesses to respond to further 
  crowding out by putting more pressure on banks to increase existing 
  lines of credit and to open new commitments. However, there are 
  reports that banks are exercising greater selectivity in their 
  lending policies. An official for one utility claimed that banks are 
  becoming increasingly reluctant to raise lines of credit to public 
  utilities. And an electronics manufacturing company, which tried 
  unsuccessfully to increase revolving loan commitments at banks 
  around the country, gave a similar report.
     </p>
     <p>
      Bankers admit to increased loan selectivity, saying they are 
  determined to protect liquidity positions and are not actively 
  seeking new loan commitments. They expressed concern that if the 
  inability of corporations to go into capital markets is prolonged, 
  commercial banks will not be able to meet short- and intermediate-
  term credit needs. They expect the utilities, in particular, to be 
  hard pressed to operate on bank credit if capital markets remain 
  inaccessible much longer. In addition, several bankers said smaller- 
  and medium-sized companies would ultimately bear the brunt of a 
  credit squeeze. Their reasoning was that when major corporations are 
  crowded out of capital markets, they will turn to bankers who will 
  accommodate the larger borrowers first. Inevitably, less credit 
  would be available for smaller companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      The latest employment statistics suggest the district labor market 
  is stabilizing. In Texas the number of jobholders has been edging 
  upward while the unemployment rate has dipped below 6 percent. 
  Moreover, indicators of future labor market strength suggest this 
  trend is likely to continue. Initial claims for unemployment 
  insurance have dropped roughly a fifth from the peak reached earlier 
  this year. And the average workweek in manufacturing has climbed to 
  40.1 hours, up from 39.7 hours in February.
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment in the construction industry in the district, however, 
  continues to fall. But the drop has not eased wage demands. In the 
  north Texas area, for example, work on approximately 1,300 projects 
  was stopped recently when 26,000 trade union members went on strike. 
  Currently, the union is holding out for a 40 percent hike in the 
  hourly wage rate over the next three years.
     </p>
     <p>
      The government program to grant a maximum $2,000 tax credit to new 
  home buyers has been termed "largely disappointing" by area 
  homebuilders and mortgage lenders. Respondents to a survey said even 
  though the program has produced some pickup in homebuilding, it has 
  failed to give the industry a substantial boost. Builders offered 
  several reasons for the ineffectiveness. Not all of the potential 
  home buyers are aware of the program. And ambiguities still exist 
  about which homes qualify for the program. Moreover, builders said 
  houses that have been on the market for more than a few months 
  cannot realistically be sold under the program. Because houses must 
  be sold at the lowest asking price (normally the original price), 
  builders cannot recapture interest expenses that have accrued on 
  those homes that have been on the market for some time. Builders 
  generally view the program as little more than a windfall for people 
  already planning to buy; people who were not serious prospects 
  before the program have not been persuaded to buy. The largest 
  homebuilder in the Dallas area summed up his colleagues' views of 
  the program with "if a couple cannot afford the first monthly 
  payment this summer, a tax break next April will not change their 
  minds."
     </p>
     <p>
      The early fall and back-to-school apparel shows held in Dallas in 
  April were described by market observers as strong. But individual 
  apparel manufacturers were somewhat less enthusiastic. Buying 
  sentiment by retailers, nevertheless, has improved greatly in recent 
  weeks. Nevertheless, apparel production in Texas—which accounts for 
  nearly a tenth of manufacturing employment—is still running about 
  70 percent of productive capacity.
