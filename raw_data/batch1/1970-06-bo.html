      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 17, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Seven members of our Board of Directors and three
      <br/>
      well-known 
academicians were contacted in the preparation of this report. 
Because of noncomparable types of responses as well as wide 
differences of opinion, no general summary seems possible. 
Respondents' viewpoints ranged from serious concern over the 
economic outlook to satisfaction that we are about on course. Their 
comments, as given below, are separated on the basis of real versus 
monetary markets.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       Monetary Conditions and Capital Markets
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Professor Otto Eckstein characterized capital markets as currently 
being in a "most unusual state", attributing this to (1) the 
System's switch to aggregate targets, (2) the continuing high rate 
of inflation and suspicion that it will not abate, and (3) 
uncertainties wrought by Cambodia and—particularly—the stock 
market. With respect to the Fed's current stance, Eckstein 
emphatically pointed out that policy can be judged as having been 
easier over the last few months only by a monetarist's standards. 
Measured from any starting month previous to February 1970, the 
widely touted 10 percent annual growth rate of money stock shrinks 
to 3 to 5 percent. On top of this moderate rate of growth, Eckstein 
interprets the events of April and May as having led to a greatly 
increased liquidity preference on the part of the public, concluding 
that endorsement of a 4 percent rate of monetary growth during the 
current period is "really somewhat cavalier".
     </p>
     <p>
      Professor James Tobin concurred with Eckstein on this view of System 
policy, additionally pointing out that with a 4 or 5 percent rate of 
growth, money supply is shrinking in real terms. Tobin also voiced 
fears that the Fed's excessively tight policy in combination with 
its shift to aggregate targets has forced interest rates to a point 
well above the real rate of return on capital, a state of affairs he 
feels will depress real activity more than we are bargaining for.
     </p>
     <p>
      At the opposite end of the spectrum was Professor Henry Wallich, who 
stated that Fed policy is threatening to become overly easy "no 
matter how money stock is measured".
     </p>
     <p>
      Views varied also on the causes and the implications of the stock 
market decline. Wallich feels the principal explanation is the 
necessary, but painful, adjustment of equity markets to a 9 percent 
bond market. Tobin, on the other hand, feels the decline has been 
serious, stating that it will have both wealth and cost of capital 
effects, and that it is symptomatic of a general economic malaise. 
When viewed from the more regional, micro outlook of our banking 
directors, money market conditions appeared more optimistic. Only a 
month ago all three of our Class A directors were reporting 
commercial loan demands at an all-time high at their respective 
institutions. Two now report that this situation has moderated to a 
degree where their banks can handle it. Our directors also report a 
healthy pickup in deposit inflows over the last three weeks in all 
categories, but particularly in consumer-type deposits. Mr. Kennedy 
noted that for the first time in 1970, deposit figures at his 
institution are now exceeding year-ago levels. Taken together, these 
factors represent a substantial shift toward optimism among our 
banking directors from a month ago.
     </p>
     <p>
      <strong>
       GNP and Real Market Aggregates
      </strong>
      <br/>
      Our academicians shifted positions in their discussion of the 
outlook in real markets, with Eckstein becoming the most bullish. He 
sees the economy currently hovering between recession and no growth, 
but remains convinced that most of the GNP markdown will occur in 
the first half of this year. While he hasn't made a run on his model 
for about three weeks now, he sees total 1970 GNP falling in the 
$982-$985 billion range, with unemployment at 5.0 to 5.2 percent by 
the year-end. Eckstein further offered the opinion that, if we do 
have a recession (however measured), it will be far and away the 
mildest of the postwar period.
     </p>
     <p>
      Wallich similarly sees 1970 nominal GNP winding up in the $980-$985 
billion range, with a nominal fourth-quarter gain of about $15 
billion. While he identified unemployment, prices, and interest 
rates as all behaving worse than expected, he expressed confidence 
that the nominal GNP forecasts made earlier this year will hold up 
quite well. Noting how successive capital surveys have shown a 
consistency, he does not feel that capital expenditure plans are 
collapsing, and he sees the possibility of bringing the GNP deflator 
down to a level of 4 percent by the year-end. On the outlook for 
unemployment in the third and fourth quarters, he was somewhat more 
bearish than Eckstein.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin once again provided the most gloomy assessment, predicting 
unemployment will rise to at least 5 1/2 percent by the year-end, 
and very possibly higher. He did not provide us with GNP projections 
for the next two quarters.
     </p>
     <p>
      Again turning to the micro-oriented views of our directors, the 
picture is quite mixed. Mr. Robertson of the Bangor Punta Corp. 
(aircraft firearms, recreational equipment, farm products, etc.) 
reports that sales are continuing a sharp deterioration in nearly 
all their lines, with the one major exception the capital goods 
produced in their process engineering division. Their layoffs have 
been substantial, and capital expenditure plans have been cut back 
30 to 40 percent. Other directors, however, noted that layoffs seem 
to have subsided in their areas. Messrs. Cabot (Cabot Corp.) and 
Carter (Nashua Corp.) report their capital expenditure plans are 
continuing at or near the levels originally planned, although—apropos of Tobin's point above—Mr. Carter did note that their 
capital spending is becoming increasingly contingent upon securing 
reasonably priced financing. Other queries to our directors produced 
no shift in sentiment from the views they expressed a month ago.
