      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 14, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       According to directors of the head office and the Buffalo Branch and 
other business leaders, Phase II on balance has been relatively 
successful in curbing the wage-price spiral. New developments in 
Vietnam have had little or no impact on business and consumer 
confidence; the recent retail sales picture seemed somewhat less 
bright than last month's and businesses continue to follow very 
cautious inventory policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning Phase II, respondents' current assessments varied 
somewhat but can perhaps best be summed up by the view of a head 
office director, chairman of the board of a New Jersey bank, who 
stated it had both its good and bad aspects and while a wage problem 
still existed, it was not as serious as last year's. Among other 
head office directors, a senior official of a large New York City 
bank gave the program "'A' for effort and 'B' for performance" and 
felt there would be a Phase III. The president of a large nonferrous 
metal-producing corporation thought the program was "hurting" 
corporate profits and thus making return on investment inadequate by 
controlling prices more effectively than wages. A senior official of 
a major metal container firm, however, felt Phase II has helped slow 
the inflationary spiral and, on the basis of his firm's experience, 
has been a definite factor in curbing the magnitude of wage 
increases. A Rochester department store official stated that but for 
controls, wages in his area would "skyrocket." Buffalo Branch 
directors generally agreed controls had been "reasonably" effective, 
and given the number of labor contracts expiring next year, such 
controls would probably be required for at least another year. Among 
other respondents, the chairman of a large nonbank financial firm 
characterized Phase II as a "brilliant stroke," but "regretfully" 
felt it to be but the "first step" toward more controls. A former 
senior official of this Bank, while not assessing the program as 
"brilliant," stated he was surprised by how well it was working.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to most respondents, recent military developments in 
Vietnam have had little or no impact on business and consumer 
confidence. As will be noted below, however, some respondents 
mentioned the situation as a factor possibly slowing the gradual 
rise in retail sales that has been under way since last fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Indeed, the current consumer spending picture that emerges from the 
views expressed by respondents appears less bright than last 
month's. Buffalo Branch directors viewed retail sales in western New 
York as "holding steady," with only minor seasonal fluctuations. A 
leading Rochester retailer characterized the current retail sales 
picture in his area as "indifferent," and reported only "guarded" 
optimism among retailers regarding the outlook for the next few 
months. He felt consumers still lacked confidence, perhaps because 
of Vietnam or because of the wage controls. The container 
manufacturer also was not optimistic over near-term retail sales 
prospects for a number of reasons, including the uncertainties 
created by Vietnam, the effects of Phase II and the coming
elections. He felt the adverse impact of these factors on consumer 
confidence being accentuated by the manner in which they have been 
handled by the news media. The president of a nationwide chain of 
variety stores stated consumer spending had not been "buoyant" this 
spring, and "the consumer is not carrying the economy yet." This 
feeling was shared by the president of a "popular priced" textile 
manufacturer who, however, looked for a gradual pickup over the 
balance of the year. A senior official of a high priced, high 
quality New York City department store reported his firm's business 
had been fairly good in May and had picked up further in early June. 
He expected a continued moderate increase in sales over the coming 
months, but felt consumers remained restrained and reported his firm 
was only cautiously optimistic.
      </p>
      <p>
       This relatively lackluster consumer spending picture found its 
counterpart in reports of a continued lack of strength in business 
inventories. Some businessmen commented that with the help of 
computers to determine the minimum required, users and retailers did 
not wish to tie up working capital to carry excess inventories. The 
department store official mentioned above stated his firm's 
inventories were currently somewhat "heavier" than at this time last 
year, but they were not "crazy" over this situation and were 
actually trying to reduce them. The Rochester retailer reported 
stores in his area also were "continually" attempting to control 
inventories. The nonferrous metal producer reported no increase in 
copper inventories; the container manufacturer also saw no inventory 
increases in that industry. A New York City banker saw little 
evidence of strength in the inventory picture in his bank loan 
developments: while its total loans are well ahead of last year's, 
the increase has not been accounted for by "industrial and 
commercial" loans. Similar views were expressed by the New Jersey 
banker. And Buffalo Branch directors almost all felt there appeared 
to be no strengthening in business inventories. The only exception 
was the director of the upstate food processing firm who reported a 
buildup of food packaging material in that industry.
