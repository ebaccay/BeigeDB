       Business conditions remain strong in certain basic industries such 
as coal, oil, steel, and machinery, but shortages are still 
hampering output. Some firms are coping with inflation by increasing 
the use of escalator clauses. Inflation is contributing to some 
hoarding and speculation in inventories. Recent strength in business 
loan demand largely reflects the need to finance higher-valued 
inventories and rising accounts receivable at a time when real cash 
flow is deteriorating.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to our directors, materials shortages continue to 
constitute a major problem. One machine tool executive reported that 
nondelivery of vital components has slowed the entire production 
process. A director from a large business machines firm, however, 
said that the raw materials situation is improving. Another director 
indicated that basic materials industries are going to expand 
capacity significantly (until now, pollution control expenditures 
have absorbed a high percentage of their capital equipment 
spending.) One director noted there is no longer an oversupply of 
large cars, in fact, it appears that the auto companies may have 
over-reacted in their shift to small car production. Demand in the 
coal industry is so intense that, according to one director, "coal 
at $35 a ton includes logs, bone, slag...anything." A banker 
reflected that coal machines, which formerly would have been 
financed over 5 years, are now financed over 2 years. One banker was 
concerned over increased personal loan delinquencies and the 
alarming moves of some individuals to consolidate loans and then 
take our new lines of credit. Consumers appear to be maintaining a 
high level of spending according to one of our directors associated 
with a major retail chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       A number of large industrial firms in the District were questioned 
on recent developments in pricing policies, working capital 
positions, inventory situations, and capital spending plans. The 
responses suggest an increased use of escalator clauses in long-term 
contracts for products bought and sold. Indexing (in one form or 
another) is also increasingly common in contracts and orders 
involving long lead-time items. The steel industry continues to 
quote prices at time of delivery rather than at time of booking. A 
major coal producer said that since last month coal prices have been 
quoted at time of shipment with all cost increases based on an 
escalator clause. In addition the firm recently wrote several long-term contracts calling for upward price adjustments whenever the 
rate of return on investment falls below the rate specified in the 
contract. Liquidity positions are mixed. Some businesses report 
ample cash positions (steel, oil, coal, chemicals, nondurable 
consumer goods). They have been net suppliers of funds to the 
commercial paper and CD markets. Firms in the machinery, tire and 
packaging industries have been borrowing heavily from banks and the 
commercial paper market to finance inventories and accounts 
receivable. Virtually all firms report increasing receivables, which 
they say is typical during periods of tight money and rising prices. 
Several machinery companies commented on a general tendency for 
their customers to delay paying bills as long as possible. One major 
oil company by contrast has reduced its receivables and improved its 
liquidity position by withdrawing about 2.5 million credit cards 
since September, thus forcing its customers to pay cash. In turn the 
firm is required to make immediate payment to the Arab countries for 
purchases of crude.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firms contacted generally want to build their stocks-mainly to 
protect current production and sales schedules but in some instances 
as a hedge against price increases. Steel producers would like to 
rebuild depleted stocks but find it impossible because of strong 
customer demand. Some of the steel inventory accumulation by 
customers has been price-hedging according to the steel mills. Steel 
producers are also desperately in need of coal supplies. Oil 
companies have been unsuccessful in trying to build stocks. 
Machinery companies report inventories must be built before 
production can be increased. Shipments are being held up for lack of 
materials and component parts. Shortages of raw materials have also 
prevented chemical and packaging firms from increasing their
inventories as much as they would like. Several firms however 
pointed to the growing risks of speculating on certain price 
volatile raw materials.
      </p>
      <p>
       Capital spending plans are not being altered as a result of current 
financial or economic conditions. Several firms mentioned that 
shortages of materials could possibly result in their spending being 
stretched out. As a general matter, firms intend to finance fixed 
capital investment from external sources of funds. One steel company 
with large spending plans said it would be reluctant to borrow now. 
They will first liquidate some of their marketable securities and 
use reserves set aside for capital programs before resorting to 
external financing at current interest rates. A rubber-chemicals 
producer said high interest rates might adversely affect spending 
plans for the tire industry, but borrowing costs are easily 
recovered for investment in chemicals and plastic goods because of 
higher returns.
      </p>
      <p>
       The increase in business loans by District banks continues to be 
strong, although at a slightly reduced pace from March. Bankers 
indicated that loan demand involves, in large part, takedown of 
lines-of-credit to finance inventories and increasing accounts 
receivable. The commercial paper rate differential and delay in 
going to capital markets also help to explain the strength in 
business loan demand. A number of bankers, however, report that some 
loans are not being repaid at stated maturity. Corporations are 
caught in a cost squeeze due to the underestimation of increased 
costs. Bankers report a decrease in foreign commercial bank lending 
and some slowdown in loans to nonbank financial institutions. As a 
general matter, banks are being conservative and selective in 
accommodating loan demand by REITs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There seems to be mixed opinion on prospects for bank credit. Some 
of the bankers contacted see little letup in business loan demand 
because businesses will increasingly feel a liquidity squeeze. Also, 
they expect continued heavy demand for financing capital programs. 
On the other hand, a few expect a letup in bank credit as the spread 
between the commercial paper rate and the prime rate narrows.
