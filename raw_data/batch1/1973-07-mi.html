       Bank directors had mixed views on how Phase IV should be structured, 
but generally supported tighter fiscal policies to accompany the new 
wage-price control program. District labor markets were 
characterized as tight, and skilled workers were in many cases 
scarce. District businessmen continued to be confronted with 
shortages; in some instances a lack of materials has actually slowed 
District business activity. Further advances in District consumer 
spending were reported and District retailers anticipated no 
immediate letup in their sales growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bank directors' opinions varied on how Phase IV ought to be 
structured. Two directors believed Phase IV should concentrate on 
those industries that are significantly contributing to our current 
inflationary situation—industries where price increases are the 
most visible. Another view was that big companies and unions should 
be required to inform the government of proposed wage and price 
increases. One director wanted Phase IV controls to be as flexible 
as possible, and another director voiced opposition to mandatory 
wage-price controls. One director expressed a personal dislike of 
wage-price controls, but believed that such controls would be 
necessary for some time in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although their views varied, bank directors generally favored 
tighter fiscal policies to accompany Phase IV. A cutback in the 
investment tax credit was favored by one director and another felt 
several measures to tighten fiscal policy would be necessary to deal 
with our current inflationary situation. Rather than raising taxes, 
one director advocated cutting expenditures. Another director voiced 
his opposition to increasing personal taxes because, in his opinion, 
tax increases would only result in higher wage demands since 
inflation has already eroded a considerable amount of workers' 
purchasing power.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the bank directors' responses, District labor markets 
were characterized as tight. Employment conditions have improved 
recently in the upper peninsula of Michigan, and a Wisconsin 
director indicated that unemployment was not a problem in his 
community because local industries were expanding. A South Dakota 
director reported gains in his state's manufacturing activity and 
disclosed that workers were in short supply. A Minnesota director 
reported an abundance of summer and college educated workers but a 
lack of workers for permanent year-round blue collar jobs. A 
director from southeast Montana revealed employment gains in his 
area and stated that labor shortages existed for workers in the 
service industries and farm workers. A director from Bozeman, 
Montana indicated a shortage of construction workers in his area. A 
North Dakota director, on the other hand, disclosed no lack of 
employable workers in his state.
      </p>
      <p>
       Various material shortages continued to confront Ninth District 
businessmen .and in some instances shortages have curbed District 
business activity. A South Dakota director indicated that spare 
parts for agricultural machinery were in very short supply and that 
new farm machinery was almost impossible to obtain. A small 
manufacturer in his area has been unable to expand operations 
because of a lack of steel. A director associated with the 
construction industry revealed that cement and reinforcing steel 
continued to be in tight supply and indicated that a lack of spare 
parts was also a construction industry problem. Two large 
Minneapolis/St. Paul manufacturers reported difficulties in 
obtaining electronic components and one firm disclosed these 
shortages have slowed down production. Also, a lack of kraft paper 
has restrained the output of another Twin Cities firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several directors indicated that their areas' businessmen were 
continuing to express concern over the gasoline situation, and 
gasoline shortages have affected the District's tourist industry. In 
the upper peninsula of Michigan a 10 percent decline in tourist 
business from a year ago was attributed to the gasoline supply 
situation. In North Dakota slow business at that state's major 
tourist attraction was also attributed to the gas supply problem. In 
South Dakota no expansion in tourist activity was foreseen. In 
Montana, on the other hand, tourist business has been good so far 
this year. One Montana director voiced the opinion that the concern 
over gas shortages has caused individuals to take their vacations 
earlier and his area experienced a good June tourist business.
      </p>
      <p>
       District consumer expenditures have continued to expand and further 
increases in consumer spending are anticipated throughout the summer 
and into early fall. Large Ninth District retail stores reported 
recent sales running 8 to 10 percent above a year earlier, with 
particularly strong sales outside the Minneapolis/St. Paul 
metropolitan area. Most survey respondents attributed their sales 
increases to improved farm income and to strong sales of durables 
accompanying new home purchases. Survey respondents expected sales 
increases in the 8 to 10 percent range to continue through the 
summer, with possibly some tapering off this fall. Retail sales in 
rural areas were expected to remain strong through 1974.
      </p>
      <p>
       Area automobile dealers reported phenomenal rises in new car sales 
this spring: trucks and smaller cars were selling particularly well. 
Several dealers noted that sales of smaller cars were well in excess 
of their manufacturers' capacity to produce these models. Most 
dealers stated that gasoline mileage has become of great importance 
to new car buyers and cited this as a major reason for the sharp 
rise in sales of smaller automobiles. Truck sales this spring have 
been 20 percent to two-thirds higher than a year ago, with most of 
the increase again attributed to higher rural incomes. Auto dealers, 
however, were concerned that current high sales may be displacing 
potential sales for the 1974 model year.
