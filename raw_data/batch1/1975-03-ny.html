      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Second District directors and other business leaders who were 
  contacted recently on balance took a rather dim view of the near-term economic outlook, but most expected a turnaround in business 
  activity during the later part of 1975. The retail sales picture 
  remained uninspiring, particularly in New York City. More 
  encouraging was the reported significant reduction in retail 
  inventories, and the improvement—albeit limited—in certain 
  manufacturers' inventory positions. Comments regarding business 
  capital outlays reflected a note of caution in that sector. There 
  continued to be reports of a softening of prices of certain raw and 
  semi-finished products and, at the retail level, of further price 
  concessions, including a spreading of the "rebate" device. The 
  District unemployment rate continues well above the nationwide 
  average, although the most acute problems seem to be concentrated in 
  New York City, Buffalo, and northern New Jersey.
     </p>
     <p>
      None of the respondents commenting on the swiftness of the 
  deterioration in the economy foresaw a bottomless downward spiral. 
  Considerable uncertainty, however, surrounded the timing of the 
  turnaround, with the respondents in general looking for a recovery 
  to take place later than suggested by some official forecasts. Among 
  others, the chairman of a large airline stated that, at this 
  juncture, he saw no indications of a turnaround as yet. The chairman 
  of a large metal producing firm expected the upswing to be delayed 
  until the start of the fourth quarter, when he looked for an 
  improvement in auto sales as new models were introduced. Among the 
  Buffalo branch directors, those from the Buffalo area, which has 
  been hit especially hard by the downswing, felt that it might well 
  be year-end 1975 before the turnaround takes place. On the other
  hand, a director from the Rochester area, where business activity 
  has remained relatively strong, expected the turnaround by summer or 
  early fall. Among other respondents, the chairman of a diversified 
  international chemical concern stated that the recession would be 
  worse than had been generally expected, and the chairman of a 
  conglomerate stated that he could not get enthusiastic until retail 
  sales picked up, and would not predict when that would occur.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding consumer spending, New York City department stores, 
  following a poor January, had another poor month in February. 
  Similar conditions prevailed in Buffalo. Sales elsewhere in New York 
  State continued to perform somewhat better than in the State's two 
  largest cities. An official of a trade association reported that 
  while sales at some New York City stores had picked up somewhat, 
  business at others had declined, and that on balance February sales 
  at City department stores would be somewhat lower in dollar terms 
  than in February 1975. On the brighter side, however, his impression 
  was that there had been a slight improvement in recent days, a view 
  also expressed by some retailers. Moreover, he reported that the 
  merchants he has been in contact with were somewhat more optimistic 
  than last month, and looked for an upturn as the spring season gets 
  underway.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of reports indicate that further progress has been made 
  toward reducing retail inventories, in good part reflecting 
  significant cutbacks in merchants' purchases from their own 
  suppliers. In this context, the chairman of a very large New York 
  City-based department store chain with branches across the country 
  stated that while his firm had been badly overstocked last November, 
  it has now managed to significantly reduce its inventory position. 
  He also felt this was true of the retail industry generally. 
  Similarly, a senior official of another nationwide department store 
  chain stated that as a result of an aggressive reduction program, 
  his firms' inventories were now 20 percent below their level in the 
  comparable period in 1974. At the manufacturing level, the chairman 
  of a chemical firm reported that his firm had reduced inventories to 
  desired levels, and the chairman of a health and cosmetics products 
  manufacturer stated that his firm had no overstocking problem. 
  Another observer noted that while there has been a general attempt 
  by industry to reduce inventories, a decline in sales has partly 
  frustrated such efforts in some cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      A note of caution characterized comments on capital spending. A 
  director stated that businesses were attempting to restore liquidity 
  positions and as a result were scaling down large projects. One of 
  the nationwide retail firm officials mentioned above reported that 
  his firm was completing stores at shopping centers that were already 
  on the way, but was putting "little new on the books". One of the 
  metal producers reported that his firm had completed a new aluminum 
  plant, but was not putting this plant "on stream" at this time 
  because of the softening in the demand for aluminum. An airline 
  official stated there were 100 to 250 too many jets available for 
  the airline industry. (He further predicted that the airline 
  industry would show "zero profits" in 1975.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Regarding prices, the nationwide decline in wholesale prices was 
  reflected in reports of price declines for a number of primary 
  products, including copper, brass, fibers, and raw materials used in 
  the health and cosmetics industry. At the retail level, there were 
  further reports of price concessions in connection with promotional 
  activity and of a spreading of the rebate device to such products as 
  cameras, sewing machines, and home appliances. In the New York City 
  area, rebates are being offered on purchases of condominiums and on 
  leases of luxury apartments.
     </p>
     <p>
      The District unemployment rate continues well above the national 
  average, in large part reflecting the high jobless rates in New York 
  City, northern New Jersey, and Buffalo. The unemployment rate for 
  New York State rose to 9.3 percent in January. It was 10.6 percent 
  in New York City, where many of the City's principal industries—such as dressmaking, printing, construction, and retail trade—are 
  acutely feeling the downswing in economic activity. In Buffalo, the 
  rate was up to 13.4 percent, reflecting the downturn in the auto, 
  steel, and machinery industries.
