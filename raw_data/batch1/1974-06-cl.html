      <p>
       Manufacturing activity in the District appears to have strengthened 
in May for the second successive month, and bank loan demand showed 
little change. At a meeting held in this Bank on June 7, thirty 
economists (primarily from major industrial firms and banks in the 
District) generally agreed that the economy was beginning to recover 
and indicated they expected continued strengthening in output during 
the balance of this year, accompanied by abatement of price 
increases by the fourth quarter. In the discussions, considerable 
emphasis was placed on the crosscurrents of strengths and weaknesses 
in the economy, distortions caused by inflation and price controls, 
uncertainties regarding the impact of monetary policy, and the 
response of labor to the past rate of inflation. According to a 
source in the savings and loan industry, deposits about equaled 
withdrawals in May, following sizable outflows in deposits during 
April.
      </p>
      <p>
       Preliminary returns from our monthly manufacturers' survey suggest 
further improvement in new orders, shipments, backlogs, and 
employment in May. Inventory investment shows some sign of abating. 
The percentage of firms reporting price increases was the highest in 
the 10 years of this survey.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major banks in the District report little change in business loan 
demand in recent weeks. Two Cleveland banks reported what they 
consider a temporary slackening in demand, with the passing of 
earlier shifts of borrowers out of commercial paper. Another has 
experienced some unexpected demand because two large industrial 
customers postponed capital market financing. Construction loans 
present problems to four of six large banks contacted. These 
problems involve requests for maturity extensions and increased loan 
amounts and reflect cost overruns, materials shortages, and, in some 
cases, delayed or canceled takeouts of permanent financing by 
insurance companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The business economists project a 1-percent growth rate for real GNP 
during the second quarter, followed by gains of 2.4 percent and 4.0 
percent in the third and fourth quarters. Over the same period, the 
GNP deflator is projected to rise at annual rates of 8.2 percent, 
7.4 percent, and 6.0 percent, respectively. The unemployment rate is 
expected to drift upward to 5.75 percent by year-end. The projected 
economic recovery is based largely on improvement in the consumer 
sector and strength in capital spending. Some economists raised 
questions as to how much of the recent pickup in retail sales was 
due to tax refunds and whether real income of consumers would 
recover in the near term. The sentiment of the group was that there 
would be an acceleration of nominal wage increases during the second 
half; moderating inflation would, therefore, result in real income 
rising enough to sustain a recovery. New car sales, in particular, 
are expected to remain on an upward course. The median forecast of 
10 economists whose firms depend heavily on the auto market places 
this year's domestic new car sales at 8.1 million units and imports 
at 1.6 million units. Fleet purchases of new cars, which have been 
below normal during the last two to three quarters, are expected to 
bolster sales in the months ahead. Automotive economists also see 
evidence of a recovery in sales of recreational vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the matter of capital spending, there was widespread agreement 
among the roundtable economists that the secular need for increased 
capacity overwhelms normal cyclical forces. According to the 
economists, capital spending ordinarily would be expected to weaken 
under conditions of tight money and prospects for declining 
corporate profits. Some economists noted that much business 
investment is planned on the prediction that long-term interest 
rates will be lower and demand stronger toward year-end. The 
prevailing view was that, despite high interest rates, the pressures 
for capital spending are on the upside. Basic process industries, 
such as steel, petroleum, and chemicals, are considered to have the
best liquidity positions for financing their investments. On the 
other hand, utilities appear to be reassessing their spending plans 
in view of the dramatic shift in their cost structure and 
uncertainties regarding growth prospects. Automotive economists hold 
the view that sales of heavy trucks will begin to decline later this 
year, partly because of increased costs associated with antiskid 
devices. It was reported that capacity limitations and shortages 
have held down the recent physical volume of capital outlays. A 
shortage of casting capacity, for example, has contributed to a 
short supply of engines, which has in turn held down shipments of 
trucks. Steel shortages also have inhibited shipments of numerous 
capital goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several steel industry economists said steel shortages will become 
even worse during the second half. Shipments have been above 
industry capacity for two years. With mill inventories depleted and 
the deferment of needed maintenance, the steel industry's ability to 
ship in the second half will be less than in the first half. 
Moreover, if there is a coal strike in December, the steel industry 
will be forced to shut down because coal and coke supplies are very 
tight. Little relief in the steel situation is expected during 1975. 
A steel economist expressed the opinion that the economy's potential 
growth rate next year could be restricted by the limited 
availability of steel.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the roundtable group, sectors of near-term weakness in 
the economy include housing, the net export balance, and inventory 
investment. An economist with a Federal Home Loan Bank reported that 
the savings and loan industry would have sufficient funds to ensure 
1.6 million housing starts for 1974 if there is no massive 
disintermediation. At any rate, housing is projected to begin 
recovering very slowly beginning in the fourth quarter. The net 
export balance is expected to decline for the remainder of the year. 
Inventory investment, following a pickup in the second quarter, is 
expected to ease slightly in the second half. It was noted that 
there has been an unknown degree of inventory speculation. As prices 
of certain raw materials come down, inventory building should 
subside.
      </p>
      <p>
       An economist with a major agricultural corporation discussed the 
outlook for grains and meat. Wheat and feed grain crops are expected 
to be sufficiently abundant to cause some price declines between now 
and next fall. Prices of livestock and hogs, however, are expected 
to rise 10 to 15 percent at wholesale, while broilers could rise by 
one-third.
