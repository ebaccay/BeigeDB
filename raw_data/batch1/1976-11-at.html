     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 10, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A mixed pattern of recovery persists in the Southeast. Production in 
  the textile and apparel industry is weak while paper output is high. 
  Fears of wage and price controls have fostered price hikes; but some 
  leveling of prices is reported following earlier increases. A 
  shortage of coking coal exists, while a future shortage of beef 
  appears likely to occur. Capital investment remains weak in the 
  Southeast. Business has improved for hotels and motels. Strength in 
  consumption is chiefly confined to autos and hard goods, although 
  colder weather has stimulated apparel sales to some degree. Some 
  recent evidence suggests that spending growth may be occurring 
  primarily among relatively affluent consumers, while less well-heeled customers remain cautious.
     </p>
     <p>
      Production in the textile and apparel industries is flat, except for 
  denim. Weak demand is attributed to higher prices in the absence of 
  any major style changes. Stores in several areas report reluctance 
  to build inventories in the face of recent slackness in demand. Some 
  price reductions have been made by manufacturers to reduce 
  inventories. Synthetic yarn prices are expected to remain stable, 
  but cotton yarn will rise in price. Constant restyling has 
  maintained strong demand for denim fashion jeans. Manufacturers are 
  forced to import fabric to meet demand. Labor is short in some parts 
  of the industry; plants located in smaller towns enjoy a more 
  abundant supply of labor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The paper business appears to be lagging behind changes in the 
  general economy. Newsprint sales have increased slightly because of 
  increased use of advertising inserts. Plants in the South and the 
  rest of the U. S. are running near full capacity, but Canadian mills 
  have excess capacity. A price increase of about 10 percent is 
  anticipated in response to higher energy costs. Demand for 
  supermarket bags is strong, but sales of textile industry packing 
  material are weak. Converters who use paper to make finished goods, 
  such as envelopes, tablets, and cigarette packages, are operating at 
  about 70 percent of capacity. They are experiencing a cost-price 
  squeeze. In contrast, a manufacturer of flexible packaging material 
  for the food industry has experienced strong sales increases but 
  reports cost pressures for raw materials such as cellophane.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several reports of price increases mention fear of wage and price 
  controls as a precipitating factor. One manufacturer's transaction 
  price is 16 percent below his list price because he wants to avoid 
  being tied to a low price. He also notes that many of his suppliers 
  are selling below quoted list prices. A steel manufacturer also 
  remarks that the threat of price controls is increasing prices. His 
  company is experiencing weak demand and is operating at 85 percent 
  of capacity. Yet he anticipates a 10-percent increase in prices in 
  early 1977.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major producer of synthetic fiber reports that dacron is still 
  being sold below cost. High profits attracted new entrants, and 
  overcapacity has prevented recovery of increased raw material costs. 
  This plant now operates at two-thirds of maximum capacity, but 
  inventories have been reduced and price increases are anticipated. 
  Timber prices, which had risen above the highs reached in 1972-1973, 
  have softened in recent weeks.
     </p>
     <p>
      A producer of coking coal for steel manufacturing notes a shortage 
  of its product. Prices for coking coal, unlike other coal prices, 
  have not been depressed but are being forced up because safety 
  regulations have reduced productivity and have entailed substantial 
  compliance costs. Producers of beef and sugar cane remain faced with 
  such an adverse cost-price squeeze that they are likely to shift 
  into production of other crops. Future shortages of beef appear 
  likely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital investment in southeastern industries remains weak. In the 
  paper industry, investment for expansion is considered unprofitable 
  at present price levels. Most of its spending is for pollution 
  abatement. Some textile manufacturers are replacing inefficient 
  equipment in addition to making necessary pollution control outlays. 
  A pipe manufacturer notes that "the capital goods sector is dead," although he expects his business to increase as housing and capital 
  investment expand. Coal producers in Alabama require substantial 
  additional capital investment to meet an expanding demand for coal, 
  but question whether the return is adequate to compensate investors 
  for their risks. A manufacturer of boilers reports the lowest sales, 
  nationally, since the depression. Utilities and manufacturing firms 
  are reluctant to purchase boilers for existing plants because they 
  are uncertain about the type of fuel they will be using.
     </p>
     <p>
      Business has grown for hotels and motels, as business travel, 
  corporate meetings, and conventions have picked up. Rate resistance 
  is limited, the more luxurious rooms are in demand, and higher-priced meals are being ordered. Still, higher costs are creating 
  difficulties in restoring profitable operations. Increased minimum 
  wages and energy costs are primary factors. Overcapacity in various 
  areas has limited the opportunity for price increases. Despite these 
  problems, certain areas remain attractive for hotel investments. In 
  New Orleans, one large chain is building a new hotel while another 
  is adding a second tower to its present facilities. In addition, a 
  new $.5-billion development combining office, hotel, condominium, 
  and retail space will be built in New Orleans.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the consumption sector, apparel sales remain weak, but sales of 
  autos and hard goods are strong. The onset of colder weather has 
  begun to boost retail clothing sales. Reports that better quality 
  merchandise is in greatest demand echo recent evidence that buying 
  of homes and boats is concentrated in the higher-priced lines, while 
  sales of less expensive lines remain weak. They suggest that much of 
  the strength in consumption spending may be confined to a relatively 
  affluent upper stratum. These fragments are also consistent with the 
  hotel industry trends noted above.
