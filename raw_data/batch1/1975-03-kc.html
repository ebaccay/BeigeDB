      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Interviews and local newspaper reports point to some improvement in 
  the Tenth District new housing industry. Tenth District builders, 
  home builders associations, and savings and loan institutions all 
  indicate a degree of cautious optimism for 1975. Employment has 
  improved at automobile manufacturing plants in the Kansas City area. 
  Retail sales remain soft, while inventory levels appear to have 
  stabilized. Winter wheat prospects are still regarded as good, 
  although potentially damaging dry conditions do exist in some areas. 
  The pronounced decline in farm product prices could pose a serious 
  financial problem for some producers. Total loan volume at Tenth 
  District Banks has declined in recent weeks, while deposits have 
  moved slightly upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan associations report a fairly heavy inflow of funds 
  in January and February, mainly into passbook accounts. One officer 
  notes that, while he does not foresee any large drain-off of funds, "the 'smart' money is waiting for some higher rate that seems 
  inevitable when the Government has to look for financing for the 
  rebate program". Despite this fear, mortgage rates are softening and 
  money is becoming available for the qualified buyer. A Kansas City 
  official comments that "raising the Missouri usury ceiling (from 8 
  percent to 10 percent) did not have the immediate effect we thought 
  it would, but sellers seem to be finding out they can now sell and 
  not be charged points".
     </p>
     <p>
      Savings and loan officials view the construction picture as rather 
  cloudy. One man in Oklahoma City notes that construction has been 
  slow but is picking up, with most activity in single-family homes. 
  Apartment building has dried up, however. An interviewee in Omaha 
  reports that the main market is in old houses and thinks this may be 
  due to the energy scare, with people wanting to live near the center 
  of town. Representatives of home builders associations and builders 
  themselves stress that while current sales are small by past 
  standards, they do appear to be on an improving trend, and this is 
  encouraging. Low inventories were widely reported, a situation 
  achieved by design due to uncertainty. One builder in metropolitan 
  Kansas City notes, however, that he is holding back on building at 
  this time because some 1,500 newer resale homes will be coming on 
  the market soon due to the Richards-Gebaur Air Base transfer.
     </p>
     <p>
      The president of a Nebraska home builders association comments that, 
  while labor and materials costs have stabilized, "we builders worry 
  about what will happen once the economy gets going again". A major 
  Kansas City builder states: "We are quite optimistic about 1975, 
  judging from our activity and work load so far this year. We realize 
  it is early in the year to predict, but that is really a plus for us 
  in that conditions are easing and we have most of the year to 
  benefit from it."
     </p>
     <p>
      Employment at the three automobile manufacturing plants in the 
  Kansas City area has improved significantly in the past two months. 
  The Ford Claycomo plant has recently returned to full production. 
  While the two General Motors plants continue to have workers on 
  indefinite layoff, this number is smaller than was the case in 
  January.
     </p>
     <p>
      Among department store retailers, sales have continued to soften 
  since January 1, although some strength has been seen in the past 
  week. Inventory levels now appear to be generally stabilized, with 
  little need seen to cut back further from current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although the prospects for the District's winter wheat crop are 
  still regarded as good, some concern is being expressed about the 
  very dry conditions that exist from central Kansas and Nebraska 
  westward into Colorado. A continuing deterioration of farm prices 
  could pose serious financial problems for District farmers faced 
  with steadily advancing production costs. During the past year, crop 
  prices have declined 14 percent while meat animal prices have fallen 
  28 percent. A reversal of the present price trends is not likely in 
  the near future, according to current projections. Production of 
  most 1975 crops is expected to exceed last year's levels, and 
  livestock prices are expected to remain in a depressed state during 
  the coming months as the oversupply of cattle is worked down.
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of large Tenth District banks reveals a further decline in 
  total loans outstanding during recent weeks. This change contrasts 
  with an expected seasonal increase and is indicative of the weakness 
  reported in business and consumer loans. The less than seasonal 
  increase in commercial and industrial loans is due, in part, to 
  desired reductions in inventories by firms which, in turn, also 
  reduce new loan requests. Consumer installment credit continues to 
  fall in response to increases in unemployment and to postponement of 
  durables purchases. Nebraska banks, however, report that automobile 
  rebates have raised consumer loan demand to a level comparable to a 
  year earlier. Farm and real estate loans are relatively stable, with 
  grain and fertilizer loans showing some growth among Nebraska banks. 
  On the supply side, several banks stated that their loan 
  accommodations remain highly selective.
     </p>
     <p>
      Deposits moved slightly upward over the last few weeks, with 
  strength in demand deposits and consumer time deposits offsetting 
  weakness in large negotiable certificates of deposits (CDs). The 
  large inflow of consumer-type time and savings deposits reported by 
  many banks has not reduced their efforts to solicit these deposits, 
  which continue to yield the maximum allowable rates. Large 
  negotiable CDs declined sharply, as banks adjusted their offering 
  rates relative to reduced yields on most short-term financial 
  assets. A withdrawal of United States Government demand deposits 
  prompted several Oklahoma banks to liquidate Treasury securities 
  pledged against such deposits. Many banks that are experiencing a 
  net inflow of deposits but a reduction in their loan portfolios are 
  taking the opportunity to augment their cash positions.
