      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Although our directors express more optimism this month, they are 
  cautious and anticipate no great surge of activity as yet. Some 
  express grave misgivings about Federal fiscal policy fearing that 
  the funding of the projected deficit will frustrate private 
  borrowing-investment programs. Others are less concerned; they 
  recognize that the deficit is a symptom of general malaise. For 
  February the New England unemployment rate was 10.4 percent: Rhode 
  Island's rate was 14.2, Massachusetts' was 11.0, and Connecticut's 
  rose to 9.2 percent.
     </p>
     <p>
      Our directors report that banking is attempting to improve liquidity 
  while engaging in moderate loan expansion programs. To some extent, 
  big borrowers of quality have been able to liquidate bank loans; 
  consequently, loans are down, and are concentrated with riskier 
  customers. Certificates of Deposit and Federal Funds borrowing have 
  been reduced as well. Bankers report seeking to expand consumer 
  credit and short-term commercial loans which entail a minimum of 
  long-term commitment. However, there seems to be no aggressive 
  selling of loans; there is an attitude that if the customers do not 
  materialize, the government securities market will provide an outlet 
  for funds. The outlook is for the prime to drop maybe 50 basis 
  points by mid-June; then, in the third or fourth quarter, it should 
  move upward.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors are noticing a reduction of inventories taking place. 
  Attempts to assess the situation for consumer goods lines in 
  Connecticut reveal that the long pipelines between retailers and 
  manufacturers are becoming "flatter." A director speculates that a 
  rebound in retail sales will lead to factory orders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Due to the reduction of inventories or acclimation to the slump, 
  retailers are less pessimistic. However, this does not foreshadow 
  optimism yet: A most successful major retailer in nondurables is 
  planning a 4 percent dollar volume gain (from 1974) for spring and 
  fall. Consumers are watching their purchases and seeking value for 
  their money. Even supermarket chains are pursuing extensive 
  promotions since they are only meeting their pessimistic 
  projections.
     </p>
     <p>
      A major New England electric utility is considering a public power 
  takeover of its generating facilities. Before, this was unthinkable; 
  now it is a viable option.
     </p>
     <p>
      Capital goods suppliers respond that orders are weaker, deliveries 
  stretched out, and the outlook is lean. One firm reports reducing 
  its own capital outlays 20 percent from recent plans. There is no 
  need for more capacity.
     </p>
     <p>
      In summary, there is optimism based on a slower slide of indicators. 
  Even directors that are beginning to sense that a foundation for 
  recovery is being laid, expect a sluggish economy for 1975, as well 
  as unemployment rates more than .5 percent above current levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Professors Houthakker, Duesenberry, Samuelson, Solow, Tobin and 
  Eckstein were available for comment this month. They all agree that 
  the economy has yet to hit bottom and that a credible recovery has 
  yet to be assured. Monetary policy is the key to the rebound.
     </p>
     <p>
      Houthakker feels that recent Federal fiscal actions may be too 
  stimulative and too disruptive for private financing plans. He is 
  advising that M1 growth should average 5 percent, assuming that 
  velocity observes its secular rate of decline. Once the recovery 
  commences, inflation may be a real concern: He cites the European 
  recovery and the rise in commodity price indices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Duesenberry is reasonably content with recent policy. However, he is 
  anxious to provide for growth of the monetary aggregates consistent 
  with recovery: This may require temporary rates of expansion of 8 
  percent. He notes that household saving is heavily directed to 
  passbook accounts and in the early stages of recovery; resisting 
  expansion of the aggregates could frustrate investment and growth.
     </p>
     <p>
      Samuelson senses a restoration of nerve, marking an end to the 
  recession. But the weakness of basic demand in durables, 
  construction, and investment goods requires continuing attention by 
  the Fed. "It's too late to flood the market, but too early to fight 
  the next inflation." He does not advocate exclusive interest in M1 
  or M2 , but insists that the stimulative impact of monetary policy 
  is measured by the performance of the economy.
     </p>
     <p>
      Solow agrees that it is necessary for the Fed to support a recovery, 
  and that fears of inflation must not paralyze accommodation. Most 
  forecasts of recovery assume fairly aggressive monetary policy; a 
  denial of this assumption threatens the existence of a rebound. At 
  any rate, he also argues, there is too much slack in the economy to 
  worry excessively about inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tobin also argues that there is such a long distance for recovery to 
  go (once it gets started) that inflation should not be our major 
  concern. He advises aggressive short-run monetary policy tapering 
  off as the recovery gathers momentum; the Fed could explain that 
  large growth rates of over some temporary period need not imply that 
  we are locked into such a policy over the long haul. He finds it 
  incredible that the prime is stuck above 7 percent and long-term 
  rates are so high. Final demand is weak and there is a risk of a 
  weak rebound leading to stagnation: "Turnaround is one thing, 
  recovery is another." "People should derive little comfort in second 
  derivatives when levels and first derivatives are so low." In his 
  opinion, the economy is weak and much more stimulation is required 
  for a return to well-being.
     </p>
     <p>
      Eckstein sees the Fed playing the central role for recovery. A 6 
  percent money target is tantamount to resisting recovery. High 
  interest rates and slow money growth undercut the rebuilding of 
  private confidence; the Federal Funds rate may have to go below 4 
  percent and M1 growth above 8 percent. He states that there is a 
  real fear among businessmen that in 12-18 months, a money crunch may 
  be necessary; a "swing away from stimulus now would be grossly 
  premature," however. Once the economy regains its footing, a 
  tapering of money growth is in order.
