      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 9, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Opinions expressed by Federal Reserve Bank Directors and other 
business leaders point to relatively good, albeit not spectacular, 
retail sales over the Christmas season, but little change in the 
sluggish capital expenditure picture that has emerged in recent 
months. Continued strong upward pressures on wages and prices are 
widely expected, and while most of those questioned were less than 
enthusiastic over the use of wage and price controls, many felt the 
need for additional Administration action in this area. The 
Directors felt that liquidity remained a problem for certain firms.
     </p>
     <p>
      With respect to consumer spending, retail sales in the Rochester 
area, which last month had been characterized as "terrible", were 
now reported by the President of a department store in that city to 
be better than during past Christmases. The President of an Ithaca, 
N.Y. bank found retail sales in that city to be reasonably good, 
with four out of five businesses doing better than expected, while 
the President of another upstate bank saw sales in his area as 
"looking good". The President of a large New York City department 
store, who in recent months had been more optimistic than other 
retailers contacted, was somewhat less sanguine this month. His 
firm's business had been very good in September and October, but 
flattened out in November. Nevertheless, he did feel that "the best 
part of the game was still ahead", and that business would gradually 
pick up in December. He was "certain" that the dollar value of his 
firm sales over the Christmas season would exceed last year's. He 
was not as certain, however, that the increase in dollar terms would 
be large enough to offset the rise in prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      Little new information on the plant and equipment picture emerged 
from the discussions, with the outlook about unchanged from last 
month—namely, some cutback from original plans, and an increased 
proportion of outlays going into environmental control. The Chairman 
of the country's largest manufacturer of electrical equipment 
estimated on the basis of orders for capital goods on his firm's 
books that plant and equipment outlays would increase nationwide by 
only two or three per cent next year, with the entire increase due 
to price inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sentiments regarding prices and wages developments were fairly 
gloomy. It was felt generally that the General Motors wage 
settlement would have a strong impact on wage demands and 
settlements in other areas. The Chairman of the electrical equipment 
firm saw nothing in sight to keep unit labor costs from rising 
sharply in the next two or three years, and he believes that the 
rise in productivity this year was a ''one shot deal'' and won't be 
repeated, and that the country has "built-in inflation". Concern 
over the size of wage settlements and over continued upward 
pressures on prices was also expressed by several directors and 
other business leaders.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most directors and other business leaders were less than 
enthusiastic over the use of wage and price controls. However, 
several were relatively open minded toward this approach, while many 
of the respondents felt additional action on the part of the 
Administration to limit further wage and price increases was needed. 
The Chairman of the electrical equipment manufacturer reported that 
the Business Council, which he headed until recently, had made it 
clear to President Nixon that Council Members don't want wage and 
price controls because they are convinced they will never work. One 
director, however, commented that the time was approaching when wage 
and price controls must be adopted, and another director felt that, 
while controls would not be workable over any extended period, such 
controls might have a useful psychological effect for a short 
period. A partner in large investment banking firm noted that 
incomes policies have failed all over the world where they have been 
tried, but felt it was up to the United States to seek to find a 
solution to the problem of full employment without inflation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The directors in general felt that liquidity was still a problem for 
certain firms. Two upstate bankers stated it was a serious problem 
for the marginal, smaller companies. The Chairman of the Board of a 
large manufacturing concern felt the problem was "spotty" but also 
affected some sizable companies, while another director stated that 
liquidity problems were "serious" in the airline, aerospace, and 
electronic industries and that it would be 18 months before some 
companies in these industries could "see daylight".
