      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       December 12, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Reports from area businessmen indicate that energy shortages are 
beginning to affect the District's economy. A wide range of 
industries has already or is expected to be affected by direct 
shortages of energy or petrochemical 
by-products. Labor shortages 
and order backlogs also remain acute in most industries. Some 
stockpiling of materials which are in short supply was noted. The 
effect of currency realignments has improved demand for many 
products while causing shortages of some materials. In general, area 
businessmen expect a marked slowing of the District's economy next 
year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Manufacturers of automobiles, boats, chemicals, textile and apparel 
goods, along with poultry producers, advertising firms, telephone 
companies, airlines, residential builders specializing in second 
homes, and the tourist industry have all been affected or will be 
affected by the energy shortage. The two large Atlanta area General 
Motors auto assembly plants have announced that more than 6,000 
workers will be temporarily laid off beginning December 17 to permit 
retooling for smaller cars. Further reductions in schedules and 
employment have been announced by airlines headquartered in the 
District. Miami-based Eastern Airlines has announced that nearly 
5,000 employees will be laid off, partially because of fuel 
shortages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several boat manufacturers in Florida and Tennessee have closed 
temporarily because of a shortage of petroleum derivatives needed in 
making fiberglass. Telephone companies are having trouble getting 
commitments for gasoline deliveries this year and next. This will 
curtail the large repair fleets of cars and trucks operated by these 
companies. Advertising has also been hit by the energy shortage. One 
Florida broadcasting company reports that weeks ago major oil 
companies canceled all long-term advertising contracts; airlines and 
most national auto producers soon followed. An Atlanta area 
advertising firm indicates that while most national advertisers have 
reduced their budgets, local advertising has taken up the slack.
     </p>
     <p>
      There is also much speculation about the effects of the energy 
shortage on other industries. Man-made fibers, a petrochemical 
byproduct, are in short supply and limiting the output of the 
textile industry. Besides fuel shortages, one textile manufacturer 
noted that wool is in short supply and that he cannot supply 
customers with sweaters this winter. Fuel shortages may also cause 
serious cutbacks in Georgia's $800 million poultry industry, 
affecting transportation, production of feed, and heating of broiler 
houses. The fuel shortage is apparently hurting the resort and 
second-home markets and, in general, changing home-buying patterns, 
favoring inner city locations over more suburban neighborhoods.
     </p>
     <p>
      Although some knowledgeable observers still express optimism about 
Florida's tourist industry, economists for the state reportedly 
forecasted a rise in Florida's unemployment rate, from the present 
2.5 percent to the 6.5 percent range. Motel occupancy along 
Georgia's interstate highways, where customers are mainly out-of-
state tourists, is down, and they are expected to be severely hurt 
by the gasoline situation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Shortages of other materials are plaguing many District 
manufacturers, and there are attempts to stockpile. One large 
chemical manufacturer has reduced deliveries of polyesters by 10 
percent because of a shortage of raw materials made from 
petrochemical feed stocks. Shortages of steel and boxes are also 
delaying delivery time, and his customers have attempted to 
stockpile some of these materials in short supply. The owner of a 
truck leasing firm felt that tires (again produced from 
petrochemical by-products) would soon be in short supply and 
indicated that he was now trying to stockpile a 60-day supply.
     </p>
     <p>
      Area businessmen indicate that the currency realignments have had a 
beneficial effect on demand for their products. One textile 
manufacturer indicated that he could sell his products at higher 
prices overseas and make greater profits in the short run. The 
representative of a hosiery mill reports requests for such products 
as ski and sweat suits that were formerly bought in Hong Kong. A 
bicycle manufacturer also noted that foreign bicycles are now more 
expensive than U.S. bicycles and that his company's sales were 
increasing. The currency realignments may be heightening the 
shortage of materials, however. One textile manufacturer indicated 
that textile material shortages have been aggravated because foreign 
countries have stopped selling to the U.S. now that the foreign 
price is higher. Currency realignments also have intensified the 
steel shortage. One commercial contractor notes that wire mesh and 
bar steel are in short supply and that foreign countries will not 
sell to the U.S. now. Many U.S. scrap dealers are now selling in 
foreign rather than domestic markets because of the currency 
realignments, thus intensifying the steel shortage.
     </p>
     <p>
      Most businessmen contacted were concerned over acute labor 
shortages. Without exception, they were unable to find labor, 
particularly skilled labor. However, they expected labor shortages 
to ease somewhat next year, since the general consensus was a marked 
slowing of the District economy, with shortages of energy and 
energy-related by-products largely responsible.
