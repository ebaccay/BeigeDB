      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       June 16, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District businesses reported no indication of impending 
  shortages and stressed their intention to avoid an overbuying spree 
  like that which preceded the recent recession. Similar positive 
  results were obtained in a survey of major agribusiness firms. These 
  optimistic findings contrast markedly with results reported in a 
  national survey of purchasing managers. On the financial front, 
  business loan demand has increased slightly and some banks have 
  reported that they have begun to rebuild their CD levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Contrary to the results reported in a recent national survey of 
  purchasing managers, Tenth District purchasing managers, executives, 
  and business economists do not anticipate the approach of capacity 
  constraint problems, shortages, or major price increases. The only 
  potential problem areas mentioned were those of iron castings and 
  uranium. On the other hand, several important observations were 
  repeated by a number of respondents. For example, an economist for a 
  major building materials manufacturer expressed serious doubts as to 
  the development of capacity shortages in the national economy. 
  Noting that while some industries were tighter than others, this was 
  due both to cyclical factors and to customers being encouraged to 
  buy (or even to overbuy) in the first quarter by promotions, price 
  breaks, or announced price increases. In his view, these promotions 
  explain the first quarter GNP inventory changes. In the unlikely 
  event that second quarter inventory changes are also strong, he 
  would consider this grounds for concern. Similarly, an energy 
  economist pictured an oscillating inventory picture, with 
  overliquidation in 1975 yielding strong compensating first quarter 
  data, a situation unlikely to be repeated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The major consensus, however, held by a broad range of purchasers 
  and producers of aluminum, steel, paper, wood, textiles, plastics, 
  and various petroleum products was that overbuying was not 
  anticipated and that they themselves would not participate in it. 
  One packaging executive expressed a "quiet optimism that things are 
  moving along with strength and stability." A major paper purchaser 
  noted "much resistance to stockpiling" because of the recent 
  experience and saw no evidence of any attempt to hedge against 
  future shortages. A large plastics and textile purchaser was firm in 
  stating "We're not overbuying, we're playing it lean." Similarly, a 
  major steel user stressed that "Nobody is really going out to buy 
  just anything they can get as was the case a few years ago. Instead, 
  he felt that everybody was trying "to run as lean as possible." In 
  line with these beliefs, it was generally felt that price increases 
  would fall in the 5- to 8-percent range in 1976.
     </p>
     <p>
      The one area where near term concern was expressed was in iron and 
  steel castings. If the economy continues to pick up, the possibility 
  of a severe castings shortage by mid-1977 was noted. Currently, 
  customers of foundries serving automobile manufacturers are on 
  allocation. The major reason for this impending problem, stressed 
  the respondent, was the tremendous impact on foundry costs 
  introduced by EPA and OSHA regulations. According to this source, 
  this factor has led to 20-30 small foundry closings a year and to a 
  significant cancellation of new facilities by existing foundries. 
  Also because of EPA, a paper products manufacturer indicated there 
  is a possibility of tightness in the supply of paper in 1-2 years. 
  Likewise, many other manufacturers complained about EPA and OSHA 
  regulations and costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      A longer-term problem was said to exist in uranium production, where 
  the low price in the early 1970's discouraged exploration and, 
  though the price has risen significantly, the 8-year lead time 
  points to a possible capacity crunch in the late 1970's.
     </p>
     <p>
      Two other comments by respondents were noteworthy. Three producers, 
  one of nylon textiles (supplied by DuPont), one of polyethylene 
  resin (supplied by Exxon), and one of steel, suggested that 
  artificial scarcities and rumors of shortages might have been 
  introduced by the suppliers themselves rather than being due to 
  excess demand. Finally, a large secondary manufacturer of aluminum 
  from scrap stressed that, while processing capacity is ample in his 
  industry, scrap is somewhat short. This situation is being 
  aggravated, he contends, by export of scrap and a "ridiculous Senate 
  bill to give tax credit for building unneeded recycling capacity 
  which will only increase demand for and drive up the price of scrap 
  already in short supply."
     </p>
     <p>
      Conditions in the agribusiness complex tend to mirror these 
  developments in the rest of the economy rather closely. The 
  inventory situation here is being scrutinized very carefully to 
  avoid the problems encountered two years ago. Reporting firms 
  indicated that they are either keeping inventories at minimum levels 
  or are instituting tight controls. However, a few firms mentioned 
  that they have done some hedge-buying recently on steel products in 
  anticipation of impending price increases, but the quantities 
  involved were not excessive. For the moment, very few firms are 
  encountering difficulties in procuring raw materials. Lead times are 
  reported as "normal" in most cases, although there is some evidence 
  that lead times are beginning to lengthen for steel, paper, and a 
  few plastics. However, no one seemed to be overly concerned about 
  input shortages in the foreseeable future. The reports on capacity 
  utilization were mixed. Feed manufacturers did not seem to be 
  pressing against capacity limits at all, and the same thing was 
  generally true for agricultural chemicals. Utilization rates were 
  typically under 70 percent. However, a few agribusiness firms were 
  operating at "full bore" and had plans to expand capacity. Included 
  in this group were a large farm supply cooperative, a farm equipment 
  facility that assembles combines, and a firm manufacturing on-farm 
  storage buildings. Virtually all agribusiness firms in the survey 
  reported price increases for both raw materials and manufactured 
  products, though again, generally in the 5- to 8-percent range.
     </p>
     <p>
      Tenth District banks contacted for the June survey reported small 
  increases in business loan demand over the last month. In most 
  cases, demands were made by local rather than national accounts. 
  Industries mentioned as showing increased loan demand varied—manufacturers, retailers, energy-related businesses, and 
  agribusinesses were all mentioned. One bank said that participation 
  in smaller banks' loans was an important factor. Real estate loans 
  are still weak, although interest does seem to be picking up in 
  commercial projects. Consumer installment loans have been either 
  steady or increasing slightly, with credit card sales holding up 
  better than auto or other consumer loans.
     </p>
     <p>
      Negotiable certificates of deposit were run off during the month of 
  May, reflecting the slowness of business loan demand and continued 
  inflows in savings deposits. However, most banks reported that their 
  CD levels had reached their low point, and several reported they 
  were rebuilding their CD levels.
