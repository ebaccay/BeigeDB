      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       April 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The District economy continues its adjustment to its steep economic 
  decline. Layoffs and temporary plant closings are still reported in 
  many parts of the District. Attempts at inventory realignment are 
  most often cited by businessmen as the reason for these layoffs. 
  Some companies have already made adjustments and are beginning to 
  hire back workers. Capital spending cancellations may be near an 
  end, since few cutbacks were reported in the past month. 
  Construction activity in the residential area remains bleak because 
  of the large housing overhang in many areas, particularly in 
  multifamily structures. Construction is likely to lag instead of 
  lead any general economic recovery. Reports from many parts of the 
  District again confirm the surprising tourist boom.
     </p>
     <p>
      Layoffs continue, but are now being matched by rehires in many parts 
  of the District. Several paper mills have closed their doors 
  temporarily. A Florida paper plant closed its craft mill for a two-week period in mid-March because of economic conditions. About 600 
  workers were idled. A Louisiana paper company has also laid off a 
  number of workers temporarily in an attempt to work off inventories. 
  A huge Louisiana aluminum and chemical plant has temporarily 
  furloughed workers in order to bring inventories in line with 
  demand. A Tennessee chemical plant is also laying off around 250 
  workers because of inflated inventories. Textile firms have not yet 
  recovered. Textile plants in southeast Tennessee and in Georgia 
  continue to operate with reduced work forces and shortened 
  workweeks. The Alabama Power Company has recently released nearly 
  1,800 people and has let another 700 jobs go unfilled. The biggest
  portion of those released were construction workers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Steel fabricators are beginning to feel the drop in demand for their 
  products. One fabricator is slashing prices to move inventories. The 
  company's representative indicates that he can buy raw steel at 
  about two-thirds the price of last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many businesses are now reporting prospects as looking up. 
  Apparently inventories have moved back in line for these companies. 
  In Tennessee, appliance and furniture manufacturers are beginning to 
  call back workers. In fact, one report from an eastern Tennessee 
  furniture manufacturer indicates that production schedules have been 
  increased to replenish inventory stocks. The lumber industry has 
  been hard hit by the economic decline, but a number of people in the 
  industry think that the slump in sales and prices has bottomed out 
  and that a recovery, while it will be slow, is now in sight. Recalls 
  in auto assembly plants in the Atlanta area have given some strength 
  to that area's economy. Several local area economists have mentioned 
  that they are besieged by calls from businessmen wondering when the 
  turnaround in their particular industries will be over. An 
  optimistic interpretation of this development might be that 
  businessmen will actively expand production and employment as the 
  first concrete signs of recovery develop. This might aid the 
  economic rebound.
     </p>
     <p>
      This is the first time in several months that there were no reports 
  of further cutbacks or cancellations in capital spending plans. In 
  fact, several new developments have been announced. These include: A 
  $35-million ammonia plant in Mississippi; a $30-million oil storage 
  capacity expansion plant in Louisiana; and a $10-million addition to 
  a Louisiana chemical plant. In Mississippi, $2.5 million provided 
  from the Emergency Employment Appropriations Act has been allocated 
  for the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Project. It is estimated that 
  an additional 1,000 construction workers will be brought in by the 
  end of the year to work on this project. It has been cited as the 
  largest earth-moving project ever to be undertaken in the 
  continental U. S. Several other smaller plants have been announced, 
  and new contracts let for District manufacturers.
     </p>
     <p>
      Everyone seems set for a pickup in housing activity which has not as 
  yet developed. The forces behind the housing picture are mixed 
  within the District. Reports indicate that funds are much more 
  readily available as large savings inflows occur at S&amp;Ls. However, 
  the housing overhang, partly among multifamily units, remains 
  substantial. The apartment and condominium market seems to be the 
  most overbuilt, particularly in the southeast Florida area. The 
  issuance of building permits for new dwelling units is the lowest 
  since these areas became known as Standard Metropolitan Areas. 
  However, at least in single-family housing, there are some signs of 
  improvement. One large Florida home builder has cut prices by as 
  much as 10 percent in order to stimulate sales. Atlanta's largest 
  condominium builder has recently reduced prices on selected units; 
  within 10 days most of these units sold. A representative of the New 
  Orleans area S&amp;L industry says that half of the inventory of new 
  houses at the beginning of the year is now sold.
     </p>
     <p>
      Mortgage rates have apparently declined more sharply in this area 
  than in other parts of the District. The tax credit for the purchase 
  of new homes was mentioned by only one director. He expected little 
  stimulation for home building from this credit. One final note of 
  optimism was viewed by a South Florida banker, who thought that the 
  stock of unsold condominiums in this area, which are now available 
  for sale, is generally smaller than realized. Many units are tied up 
  in litigation and will have to be refurbished before they are sold, 
  and other units will have to be completed. As a result, the 
  condominium situation is not as serious as believed. Reports from 
  District bankers, however, generally indicate that single-family 
  housing is most likely to recover much more quickly than most 
  multifamily construction.
     </p>
     <p>
      The tourist boom continues. The previously reported tourist boom in 
  Florida has buoyed retail sales in the area; apparently, the boom is 
  more general, however. Reports from the New Orleans area indicate 
  that, within the last three months, tourist and convention business 
  has been well above normal. Downtown New Orleans hotels are running 
  at about 70 percent occupancy rates. Tourism is again flourishing in 
  Tennessee, also. Registrations at Tennessee welcome stations are 
  nearly 10 percent above levels of 1973—the last good tourist year. 
  Camping business is also booming. A recent camping show held in 
  Atlanta produced record sales volumes of camping items. A recent 
  boat show in the Orlando, Florida area produced sales in the first 
  day which exceeded the whole week of the show in 1974.
