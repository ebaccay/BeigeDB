      Beige Book Report: St Louis
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       January 15, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      According to a selected group of Eighth District businessmen, the 
  recession has deepened in the past few weeks. Those firms reporting 
  slowdowns and layoffs far outnumber those reporting expanding 
  operations and rehiring of workers. Consequently, substantial 
  declines in output and employment in the District were indicated. 
  However, some activities continue to operate at relatively high 
  levels. Christmas retail sales were better than expected, but sales 
  of big-ticket items continue to drop off sharply. Crop farming, on 
  average, was profitable last year, while livestock farming is 
  currently undergoing a sharp contraction.
     </p>
     <p>
      Opinions expressed by businessmen about current economic conditions 
  ranged from concern for a worsening recession to perhaps increasing 
  concern about the impact of current and future public policies on 
  inflation. Some felt that monetary actions should be immediately and 
  drastically eased. Most of those interviewed, however, expressed 
  concern that remedies for the recession may bring on even worse 
  evils than the recession itself, such as higher and higher rates of 
  inflation. In general, considerable pessimism was expressed about 
  the long-run possibilities of reducing the inflation, although there 
  was general agreement that price increases would moderate some in 
  1975 from the very rapid increases last year.
     </p>
     <p>
      Retail department store sales in December were reported to be up 
  somewhat from a year ago, while some discount-type stores reported 
  substantial sales increases. Both department and discount stores 
  reported better Christmas sales than had been expected. Sales were 
  slow during the pre-Christmas season but picked up considerably in 
  the final days of shopping, boosting the dollar totals to above 
  year-ago levels. Strong selling items included sportswear, 
  accessories, decorative home items, silver, jewelry, and fine gifts. 
  Sales of appliances, television, automobiles, and big-ticket home 
  furnishings items, however, continue to be severely depressed.
     </p>
     <p>
      Cutbacks in production and employment at manufacturing 
  establishments continued to spread throughout the District in recent 
  weeks. Durable goods manufacturers, which have been hardest hit, 
  include producers of automobiles, lumber, furniture, and appliances. 
  Among the nondurable manufacturing categories, textiles and apparel, 
  shoes, rubber and paper, and other products have undergone the 
  sharpest contractions. In nonmanufacturing activities, construction 
  has undergone by far the sharpest contraction. Housing has been hit, 
  but road and commercial construction has also slowed. Construction 
  of both single and multifamily dwellings in St. Louis was off about 
  35 percent in 1974 from a year earlier. On the other hand, 
  nonresidential construction in the city of St. Louis was up during 
  1974, due to a number of large downtown projects. Most other parts 
  of the District reported commercial construction off from the year-earlier pace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Several product sectors continue to report fairly strong activity. 
  Energy-producing activities, including petroleum and coal mining, 
  continue strong. Farm supplies including fertilizer, pesticides, and 
  machinery continue to experience strong demand as do suppliers of 
  medical and health products. Service industries and government 
  employment have generally continued to increase.
     </p>
     <p>
      Many capital goods firms still report a high level of activity, but 
  weakness in new sales is now beginning to be felt. Some firms are 
  currently working off past order backlogs, which are quickly 
  dwindling as new orders subside. Railroad car manufacturers, steel 
  mills and foundries, environment equipment manufacturers, and 
  suppliers of oil and gas drilling equipment are among those 
  operating at relatively high levels.
     </p>
     <p>
      Loan demand has subsided, and interest rates have fallen in recent 
  weeks. Total bank loans rose less than seasonally during December, 
  reflecting weakened consumer and business loan demand. Savings 
  inflows at banks have remained level in recent weeks, but some 
  pickup was reported in the volume of savings and loan institutions 
  in November and December. Usury ceilings in Missouri were recently 
  raised from 8 to 10 percent, a change which is expected to aid the 
  state housing market.
     </p>
     <p>
      Crop farmers in 1974 fared well though crop yields were often down. 
  The relatively high incomes reflected substantially higher crop 
  prices. In general, rice, wheat, soybean, and tobacco producers 
  experienced a good year, and with relatively high crop prices 
  farmers are expected to plant large acreages in 1975. Cotton 
  producers, on the other hand, suffered from both lower yields and 
  lower prices. A sharp drop in demand for textiles participated the 
  decline in cotton prices. A considerable portion of the wheat, 
  cotton, and soybean crops is reported to be stored on farms, and in 
  some cases harvesting has not been completed.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Livestock producers are sharply curtailing operations, particularly 
    egg, poultry, and hog producers. Cow-calf operators are also 
    experiencing losses as a result of the sharp curtailment in cattle 
    feeding, the large cattle inventories, and sharp declines in feeder 
    cattle prices.
