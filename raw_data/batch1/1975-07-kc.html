      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 9, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      A survey of a number of Tenth District purchasing managers indicates 
that while some further liquidation of purchased inventories is 
still under way the inventory situation has basically stabilized. 
Except for some modest seasonal advances in production, sales, and 
employment, purchasing managers report essential stability in those 
areas as well. However, 2,200 GM employees laid off in January will 
be rehired by the Kansas City assembly plant by mid-August.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Although the Tenth District wheat harvest is running somewhat behind 
normal, recent improvement in the weather picture has permitted the 
harvest pace to accelerate, with reports received on yield and 
quality quite favorable. With prices strengthening, the District 
livestock picture has brightened considerably in recent weeks. Tenth 
District bankers surveyed continue to report weakness in total loan 
demand, although some improvement was noted in business loans in 
recent weeks. Contraseasonal declines in both demand and time 
deposits were reported at many Tenth District banks in June.
      </p>
      <p>
       Contrary to reports in the Wall Street Journal of purchasing 
managers relating a surge in new orders and production, a quickened 
pace of inventory liquidation, and encouraging employment trends, a 
survey of a number of Tenth District purchasing managers does not 
discern those developments occurring to any appreciable extent 
within the District. The term "stability" best describes the 
situation as related by the respondents to our inquiries. Although 
some further liquidation of purchased inventories is still under 
way, there were scattered reports of modest accumulation, mostly 
seasonal in nature. But most purchasing managers report plans to 
hold inventories at present levels. Production and sales have been 
holding steady recently and little or no change in employment was 
reported, nor were any sizable increases or layoffs being 
contemplated for the very near term. However, General Motors has 
announced that 2,200 workers laid off in January will be recalled to 
work at their Kansas City assembly plant by mid-August.
      </p>
      <p>
       The District's wheat harvest is running about 10 days behind normal 
this year due to the late development of the crop as well as poor 
harvest weather in some areas. However, hot and dry conditions have 
dominated the District's weather picture for the last several days, 
allowing the harvest to progress at a rapid pace. Most of the 
reports on yield and quality are quite favorable. In fact, the crop 
has been a pleasant surprise in those areas suffering wind and hail 
damage earlier in the year. Like last year, the farmers seem to be 
holding their wheat in anticipation of higher prices at a later 
date. However, there is a general feeling that a significant amount 
will be sold before the end of the year to pay production expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The livestock picture has brightened considerably in recent weeks. 
Prices have approached, and in some cases exceeded, the highs 
achieved in 1973 following sharp declines in beef and pork 
slaughter. Although feedlot placements have recently begun to rise 
and will probably continue rising the rest of the year, fed-beef 
supplies are expected to remain relatively tight. The seasonal 
increase in marketing from grass later this summer will probably 
push prices down, but the slippage may be less than earlier 
anticipated due to the very sharp reduction that is in store for 
pork output. Based on the most recent hog report, slaughter during 
the second half of the year could fall 20 percent or more below the 
year-earlier figure. Therefore, hog prices promise to be strong for 
the next several months, and this will tend to buoy cattle prices 
throughout 1975. Reflecting these developments, the index of prices 
received by farmers rose 2 percent during the month ended June 15, 
the third consecutive monthly rise. While the future direction of 
this index will depend heavily on the weather, it seems clear that 
retail food prices will continue to increase through the summer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers surveyed in the Tenth District continue to report weakness 
in total loan demand. Declines are still occurring in consumer loan 
volume and in loans for residential and commercial construction. 
Agricultural loan demand also is said to be very weak, reflecting in 
part earlier declines in feeder cattle prices and placements at 
feedlots. As noted previously, however, the livestock picture has 
improved recently. One bright spot in the loan picture is that 
business loans are reported to be picking up in recent weeks. Some 
of these loans were said to be for purposes of inventory 
accumulation. Tulsa area banks also noted a large increase in loans 
to oil and gas drilling interests, with one respondent indicating 
the loans were extended to finance drilling in Alaska. The prime 
rate charged by all respondents was either at or above the national 
level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Deposit outflows have occurred recently at many Tenth District 
banks. Both demand and time deposits appear to have dropped 
contraseasonally during June. Many bankers reported that a sizable 
decline had taken place in their large CD's over the past several 
weeks. However, a few respondents indicated that because of their 
belief that interest rates would rise they had made a recent 
decision to become more aggressive in the CD market and to acquire 
6-month to
       <br/>
       1-year CD's.
