      Beige Book: National Summary

      <strong>
       June 14, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Reports from the twelve districts indicate continued strengthening 
in business activity and greater optimism in general. Consumer 
spending, which has continued strong in most regions, seems to be 
the main source of strength. Greater output in industries closely 
related to the provision of final goods, especially durables, was 
cited as principal source of expanding manufacturing employment and 
increased business loan demand. Inventories have, for the most part, 
remained unchanged. Construction of single-family dwellings has 
continued to boost overall activity. Loan demand at commercial banks 
has increased, with consumer and business loan categories up most 
sharply. In general, wage and price increases have been moderate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most districts reported encouraging strength in sales of consumer 
goods. Part of the gain in consumer purchases was attributed by 
Atlanta, Richmond and Chicago to stronger auto sales; Dallas, 
however, reported a decline in auto registrations. Major household 
items and other consumer durables were strong in some districts. 
Kansas City, Boston and Chicago specifically mentioned recreational 
items. While retail sales rose in the St. Louis district, the 
advance was not as great as anticipated by retailers. Slowness 
characterized retail sales in the New York district, where the 
outlook was less bright than a month ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steel production was reported favorable in the Chicago and Cleveland 
districts. The output levels are considerably different, however, 
for the various steel industry products. Production of steel sheets 
for use in autos and appliances has displayed the most strength in 
both districts, while demand for steel used in commercial and 
industrial construction has remained relatively weak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Manufacturing activity was reported to be increasing in five 
districts. Sales of both durables and nondurables advanced in 
Minneapolis and capital goods orders were strong in Boston. Dallas 
reported gains in industrial production in April with broad-based 
strength across industry lines. Manufacturers that supply national 
markets are reportedly optimistic in the St. Louis district. St. 
Louis, and Chicago as well, mentioned benefits to manufacturers 
resulting from reduced foreign competition. Richmond reported 
strength in district industries. Most districts reported little 
change in inventory accumulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several reserve banks reported significant employment gains in their 
respective districts. Philadelphia indicated over 15 percent of the 
firms responding to a survey added to their payrolls and nearly 5 
percent lengthened their average workweek. In the Chicago district, 
there was an increase in the number of firms adding workers or 
stretching workweeks, but two major-city governments are still very 
concerned about unemployment. While Dallas and Boston reported no 
significant labor market changes, Minneapolis indicated the Ninth 
District's unemployment rate rose from 5.7 percent in March to 5.9 
percent in April.
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction activity has remained strong in most districts. San 
Francisco reported that national construction activity gains have 
aided recovery of the Pacific Northwest because of the greater 
demand for lumber and wood products. Generally, residential 
construction has been strong in the nation, but Atlanta reported it 
appeared to be slowing. Commercial construction has slackened and 
concern has been expressed for possible overbuilding of multiunit 
dwellings in the San Francisco and Kansas City districts. Of all the 
districts, only Atlanta reported anticipation of a surge in 
commercial construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand in general, and business loan demand in particular, were 
noted as being quite strong by most districts. Exceptions included 
New York, where an increase in total loans was not accounted for by 
commercial and industrial loans, and Kansas City, where business 
loan demand has also been weak. Richmond and Dallas reported 
strength in consumer loans, while Philadelphia and Kansas City 
reported moderate gains in consumer lending. Housing and 
construction credit were noted as sources of strength in the Dallas 
and St. Louis districts while in the Philadelphia district future 
strength in construction lending is anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four districts reported continuing strong inflows of savings 
deposits. One of the four, Kansas City, noted inflows were above 
year-ago levels but slower than earlier in 1972. St. Louis, Boston 
and Chicago also mentioned strong savings inflows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most districts cited the importance of the Price Commission's role 
in slowing the rate of inflation. The Minneapolis and San Francisco 
reserve banks indicated prices and wages were growing at reduced 
rates, and retail establishments in the Kansas City district have 
reported no sharp run-ups in suppliers' prices. In the Boston 
district, suppliers' prices have generally been rising gradually and 
one director indicated the pace was faster in the second quarter 
than in the first. In the Philadelphia district, despite 
expectations of no change in prices paid, 20 percent of the 
manufacturing firms which responded to a survey were anticipating 
establishing price increases on their own products in June. Only 7 
percent reported price increases in May.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weather and cattle prices were emphasized in reports on the 
agricultural outlook. Weather conditions throughout much of the 
Midwest reportedly had adverse effects on plantings. Excessive 
rainfall in parts of the Minneapolis and St. Louis districts have 
retarded crop developments and in the case of Minneapolis caused 
some switching from corn plantings to grain sorghums and soybeans. 
Drought conditions have developed in the Atlanta district and the 
northern part of the St. Louis district.
      </p>
      <p>
       Higher beef prices were noted by the Chicago, Richmond and Kansas 
City banks, and the St. Louis bank reported strong sales of farm 
equipment.
