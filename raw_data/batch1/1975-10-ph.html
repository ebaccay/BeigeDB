      Economic recovery is taking hold in the Third District. For the 
third month in a row, area manufacturers report that business 
conditions have improved. New orders and shipments continue to 
increase, and there are additional declines in inventories. At the 
same time, employment has increased and the manufacturing workweek 
has lengthened. However, prices paid for supplies as well as those 
received for finished products are both higher. The outlook for the 
next two quarters is for the expansion to continue. Manufacturers 
expect new orders and shipments to be higher, and no further cuts in 
inventories are anticipated. In addition, these businessmen expect 
both work forces and the average workweek to expand. But it's 
anticipated that prices will continue to climb and capital spending 
will rise only slightly. Area retailers report increased sales and 
look for an upward trend through the spring. Bankers report that 
deposits are level or off slightly, while loans remain flat.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Manufacturers in the Third District, responding to this month's 
business outlook survey, report a higher level of economic activity 
compared to last month. This is the third consecutive month in which 
35 percent or more of the respondents have indicated an improved 
business climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, none of this month's respondents reports a decline in 
economic activity. More than one-fourth report higher levels of new 
orders, and shipments are up for a similar proportion of the 
respondents. Inventories are down, on balance, but the cutbacks are 
smaller than those reported in the previous few months. Of the 
manufacturers surveyed this month, the proportion reporting lower 
stocks exceeded those reporting higher ones by only 7 percentage 
points.
      </p>
      <p>
       In July, by comparison, declines exceeded additions by 43 percentage 
points. The current expansion in manufacturing is also reflected in 
employment, which is up again this month, and in the average 
workweek, which is longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook for the next six months remains optimistic. More than 80 
percent of the executives polled look for an increase in overall 
business activity. Seventy percent expect new orders to be higher by 
April, while 68 percent anticipate an increase in shipments. 
Inventories are expected to stabilize over the period. In addition, 
almost 40 percent plan to add to their work forces, and there are 
plans to lengthen the workweek further. Modest increases in capital 
spending are also expected, but plans are still cautious with almost 
two-thirds of the manufacturers polled planning to maintain current 
levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retail executives report increases in sales after adjusting for 
seasonal factors. Apparel and fashion items are reported to be 
selling well and one contact indicates very good sales of hard 
goods. These executives look for a strong Christmas season and most 
expect sales to trend upward through the spring. Most of the 
merchants contacted feel that consumers are more price conscious 
than in the past and one notes, "as a result, it becomes more 
difficult to maintain profit margins, let alone increase them." All 
of the retailers indicate that their inventory-sales ratios are at 
desired levels, but one anticipates some supply problems by year-end 
because manufacturers aren't building inventories fast enough. Most 
of the merchants report that in terms of credit collections they see 
signs that consumers are finding it easier to pay bills on time.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the price scene, manufacturers report that prices they pay for 
their supplies, as well as prices they charge for their finished 
products, are up from last month. Prices paid are decidedly higher 
with none of the respondents reporting lower prices and close to 60 
percent paying higher ones. Prices charged are up somewhat as well 
with a little over
       <br/>
       one-fourth reporting increases. The outlook for 
the next six months is for additional increases. More than three-fourths of the manufacturers surveyed expect to be paying higher 
prices by April, and 70 percent expect to be receiving higher prices 
for the products they sell. Retail executives report that, in 
general, the prices they pay and charge continue to move up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Area bankers report that, after adjusting for seasonal factors, 
demand deposits are level or down slightly and savings accounts are 
flat. Most of the financial executives contacted report that they 
lost deposits to the Treasury during the latest offering, with one 
banker indicating a gross outflow of at least $15 million. All of 
the bankers surveyed are aware of California Federal S&amp;Ls offering 
of mortgage-backed bonds last month, and the majority report that 
they're looking into it as a possible way of circumventing 
Regulation Q ceilings and of achieving a better alignment of 
maturities. Loan volume is reported to be level or down somewhat, 
and the outlook is for it to pick up as recovery continues. One 
banker reports a slight pickup in consumer lending, and he looks for 
a further increase of 10 percent next year. These bankers look for 
short-term interest rates to rise gradually, and they expect 
inflation to be in the 6 to 7 percent range through next year. The 
majority of those contacted feel that if prices climb at a faster 
pace while M1 grows at 7-1/2 percent or less, the chances of the 
recovery aborting will increase. There is general agreement that the 
tax cut in effect now should not be allowed to lapse, at least until 
the economy expands further.
