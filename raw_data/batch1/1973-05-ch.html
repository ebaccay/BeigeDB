      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 9, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Virtually all sectors in the Seventh District are continuing to 
report rapid gains in orders, output, employment, sales, and 
profits. In many cases, these increases have been well above earlier 
projections that had been deemed optimistic. Many businessmen view 
the strength of demand as excessive and unhealthy. Output would be 
higher in a wide variety of hard and soft goods lines were it not 
for capacity and manpower limitations. Although meat prices have 
edged down, almost all other prices are rising and are expected to 
rise further. Capital expenditure plans are being revised upward. 
Some observers expect a slowing in economic growth in the second 
half, but these views are not generally supported by information on 
shipments and orders. Field conditions have slowed plantings to a 
marked degree. Business loan growth has eased significantly, but, 
overall, demand for credit remains very strong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Two exceptions to the extremely robust picture are motor home output 
and airline traffic. The largest producer of motor homes (in Iowa) 
has cut production sharply because sales, although substantially 
above last year, have been below expectations. (This development is 
not to be confused with the situation in mobile homes where, in 
contrast to weakness expected by some analysts, shipments have been 
far above last year's record.) A major airline finds that growth in 
traffic this year has only been about half as great as the 10 
percent year-to-year rise expected earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Demand for labor continued to rise throughout the district, and 
labor shortages are reported almost everywhere—even in Detroit. 
Some firms have reopened training centers shut down in 1969 or 1970. 
In many factories, average weekly hours are about as long as can be 
scheduled effectively. Absenteeism and turnover have increased. 
Hiring standards have been lowered. New hires of many large firms 
include a large proportion of veterans, minority types, and women in 
an attempt to fill prescribed quotas ("quantified objectives").
      </p>
      <p>
       Union demands are expected to go far beyond the guidelines in most 
negotiations. Six months ago, union leaders were telling truck 
drivers that little, if any, basic wage boost would be sought. 
Current demands are for an 8 percent rise in wages and a variety of 
other items that are said to add up to a 20 percent first-year 
boost. Steel industry executives appear to believe that the 
arbitration agreement will permit a settlement in 1974 without a 
strike or an inventory buildup, but this may simply mean that steel 
will follow the pattern set in the auto industry without a fight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Responding to a special question, 40 percent of Milwaukee purchasing 
managers said recently that material shortages will severely reduce 
ability to produce by midsummer. The most serious problems involve 
fuel, electricity, steel, castings, fasteners, and wood. In all 
areas, buyers continue to report lengthening lead times, and in 
recent months they have noted a sharp deterioration in overall 
vendor reliability and in quality of items received. Almost all are 
paying higher prices each month for some major items.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gasoline and fuel oil supply problem has worsened with supplies 
curtailed or shut off to independent dealers and distributors. State 
governors are calling for emergency measures to meet farm needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lead times on all types of steel have lengthened further, and new 
orders for hot and cold rolled sheet are now scheduled for delivery 
in August and September. A Chicago-area mill that expects to operate 
at capacity through the year is attempting to arrange vacations to 
reduce the summer decline in output. There is no way to increase 
steel output in the near future because of limitations of basic 
facilities, especially slabbing mills. Steel users appear to be 
building inventories, while mills have reduced their holdings of 
finished and intermediate products.
      </p>
      <p>
       Orders for most types of capital equipment are running 25-50 percent 
above last year's improved level. Orders would be even higher if all 
orders were accepted. Freight car shortages are widespread, and 
orders for new cars at last are rising significantly. Sales of all 
types of farm equipment are excellent and some types, especially 
large tractors, are in short supply. The motor vehicle industry, 
both autos and trucks, is operating at capacity. Expansion plans are 
being pushed, but availability of various components will limit 
output for some time to come. All major foreign markets for capital 
equipment are now vigorous again.
      </p>
      <p>
       A recent survey by this bank shows that district farmland values 
rose nearly 6 percent during the first quarter and are up 11 percent 
from a year ago—the largest gains registered since this survey 
started in 1958. Farm mortgage loans are readily available. District 
rural banks are meeting strong loan demand from farm borrowers, 
especially for capital investments.
      </p>
      <p>
       As of late April, only 35 percent of the corn and soybean acreage in 
Illinois had been plowed, as opposed to 78 percent a year ago and 95 
percent in 1971. While these conditions could improve rapidly with 
drier weather, delayed plantings typically result in lower yields. 
Fuel, seed, and fertilizer continue in short supply. With more 
acreage to be planted, needs will be especially large. Many Midwest 
observers anticipate little further decline in livestock prices this 
year. Bad weather has boosted feed prices, and losses of calves, 
poor weight gains, and the banning of DES will hold down meat 
supplies.
