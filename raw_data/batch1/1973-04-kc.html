      Beige Book Report: Kansas City

      <strong>
       April 11, 1973
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Residential construction activity is going on at a rapid pace in 
most tenth district cities, especially for single-family structures. 
The rising cost and short supply of some construction materials are 
being felt by some builders and customers, but funds remain 
available—though more expensive. Savings inflows to savings and 
loan institutions continue to be strong, as does mortgage loan 
demand. District commercial banks are also experiencing strong loan 
demands. Better weather conditions will probably bring increased 
livestock shipments, and the likelihood of a temporary dip in meat 
animal prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       Executives of home builders associations in a number of district 
cities, representatives of several savings and loan associations, 
and some home builders, were surveyed to acquire additional 
information about the residential construction sector, and its 
financing. Aside from being slowed somewhat by bad weather, 
residential construction activity is generally strong in major urban 
centers of the tenth district—with the exception of Albuquerque. 
Activity is stronger in single-family unit building than in multi-family structures, and there is still apparently no overbuilding of 
the former. There is a great deal of speculative building, and some 
tendency for a shift from custom toward speculative building, as 
contractors find little trouble in selling the latter. In Kansas 
City, for example, speculative builders generally have no inventory, 
with many units sold before completion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The impact of the withdrawal of Federal subsidies has varied among 
district cities. The slowdown in construction activity reported for 
Albuquerque is attributed largely to the end of Federal subsidies 
for low income housing, and a lesser anticipated effect is reported 
from Omaha and Tulsa. All respondents stressed the rising cost of 
construction materials, especially lumber, and its influence on the 
price of houses. Furthermore, some materials are in short supply. 
Lumber is not only expensive but hard to get in many places, 
particularly in the types and grades desired. Bricks are also 
reported as hard to get in Omaha, Albuquerque, and Tulsa. Increases 
in the price of concrete and the possibility of a cement shortage 
were also mentioned. On the other hand, both builders and builders 
association executives described funds as readily available, 
although getting more costly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spokesmen for various savings and loan associations corroborated the 
rapid pace of home building activity and most of those surveyed 
believe that it will continue to be strong for a while. Mortgage 
loan demand and commitments were reported as "up," "way up," "out of 
sight" by most respondents, with Denver being the major geographical 
exception. Mortgage rates have already been increased in recent 
weeks by at least one-eighth to one-fourth of one percent by 
institutions in several district cities. A further "inching up" is 
anticipated if mortgage loan demand remains high. Savings inflows 
were very good in the first quarter, although some concern was 
expressed for the future. No serious disintermediation has been 
experienced yet by the institutions surveyed. However, one 
respondent called disintermediation "a definite threat in the rest 
of 1973," and another is worried about a large amount of deposits he 
considers "vulnerable."
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand at tenth district commercial banks continues to be 
strong in almost all categories. Exceptionally strong demand has 
caused some banks to concentrate more heavily in commercial loans. 
The prime rate has risen to 6 1/2 percent at all survey banks, but 
there were few reports of credit rationing or tightening of nonprice 
loan terms. Nevertheless, several banks have become more diligent in 
enforcing compensating balances requirements, while others felt that 
rationing was imminent. Most banks have relied heavily upon 
purchases of Federal funds, CDs, and maturing securities to provide 
funds to accommodate loan demand. Outflows of demand deposits, 
savings deposits, and consumer-type time deposits have been larger 
than is typical for this time of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reactions by tenth district bankers to the proposed dual prime rate 
were mixed. Some bankers felt it would be wise to differentiate 
between national and regional borrowers, as credit demands are often 
quite different for the two groups. Others expressed the view that 
credit-worthiness—not the size of the borrower—should be the 
criterion for establishing loan rates, with a single prime rate 
serving as a benchmark. Virtually all bankers interviewed agreed 
that the dual prime system might be difficult to administer. The 
consensus seemed to be that, under the system, funds would still be 
available to meet the needs of small borrowers even when higher 
rates existed on loans to large borrowers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unusually heavy rains during March proved to be a mixed blessing for 
farmers and ranchers throughout the district. While valuable 
moisture was added to the soil for the new wheat crop, many of the 
low spots in the fields were flooded and heavily damaged. However, 
most, if not all, of this loss will probably be offset by higher 
yields in the undamaged portions of the fields. As a result of the 
wet weather, very few farmers have been able to start the field work 
that must be completed before the spring crops can be planted. 
Further delays will likely reduce corn yields and perhaps induce 
some substitution of soybeans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weather has also greatly impaired the movement of livestock to 
market, partly explaining the strong prices for cattle and hogs 
prior to the boycott. The boycott apparently has had an effect on 
the market, and producers have responded to reduced sales by 
shipping significantly fewer animals to market. On the whole, prices 
have not weakened substantially. An end to the boycott and better 
weather conditions will probably bring fairly heavy shipments of 
livestock, causing meat animal prices to dip rather sharply until 
this backlog is marketed.
