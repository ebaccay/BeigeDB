      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       March 10, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        While drought and wind damage to the winter wheat crop has been 
substantial, timely precipitation could still improve production 
possibilities considerably. Residential construction activity, 
almost all in single-family units, is strong in major metropolitan 
areas of the Tenth District. Financing appears to be more than 
adequate, with inflows to thrift institutions strong and loan rates 
stable after a recent slight decline. Loan demand at District 
commercial banks has also improved recently, with most of the 
strength attributable to regional borrowers rather than national 
accounts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Savings and loan associations in the District's larger metropolitan 
areas reported very strong deposit inflows in January, while 
associations in smaller cities generally experienced good, but not 
exceptional, inflows. February results were more uniformly good, 
though in most instances falling short of January and/or not 
reaching expectations. Generally speaking, relatively large inflows 
are expected to continue in March and April, followed by a 
flattening out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Virtually all respondents report a recent pickup in mortgage demand, 
and in commitments and/or loans. Lending rates have declined 
slightly in recent months. The consensus seems to be that rates will 
be stable to a bit lower in the near term, but perhaps going up 
slightly later in the year. Customers are shopping around for the 
best terms, according to some respondents, with the emphasis on size 
of monthly payments rather than on rate alone. At least one 
association reported lowering returns offered to savers via raising 
maturities and minimum amounts on certificates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing demand appears to be strong in major metropolitan areas in 
the Tenth District. Starts activity continues to be concentrated in 
single-family units, with virtually no strength reported in 
multifamily construction. Inventories of unsold single-family homes 
have apparently been reduced to nearly normal levels, with some 
builders expressing the desire to have a few more homes on hand. 
Most builders and builders' associations contacted confirmed the 
availability of mortgage funds and the stability of rates. Some 
Kansas City builders are suggesting a possible near-term increase of 
10 percent in the price of new homes, primarily due to price 
increases for lumber, concrete, appliances, and trim items. Some 
construction union contracts (e.g., carpenters) in the Kansas City 
area have an April 1 termination date. Builders' anticipations are 
mixed on the possible results of negotiations, ranging from "some 
real wild numbers" because of a desire to "catch up" to "no runaway" 
because of a realization on the part of both labor and contractors 
that the industry is potentially weak and large settlements ''can 
get the public turned off pretty quickly".
       </p>
       <p>
        Market prices for wheat during the spring and summer of 1976 will be 
sensitive to growing conditions in the wheat-producing areas of the 
United States and the world. The 1976 United States wheat production 
has already been adversely affected by drought conditions in the 
southern great plains. Industry sources are projecting production 
decreases of as much as 29 percent from the 791 million bushels 
produced by Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, and Nebraska in 1975. 
This could presage a 1976 United States winter wheat production of 
around 1.4 billion bushels, down from 1.65 billion bushels in 1975. 
Reports from western Oklahoma and Kansas indicate that, while 
substantial damage to the wheat crop has occurred from drought, 
wind, and greenbug infestation, timely precipitation over the area 
could still substantially improve production possibilities. However, 
to date, weather systems have brought only minimal precipitation to 
the driest parts of the Tenth District.
       </p>
       <p>
        While January grain stocks were significantly higher than year-ago 
levels for corn, soybeans, and wheat, the price-depressing impact 
was largely offset by higher demand projections. For corn, 
substantial increases in domestic feed use and in export demand 
appear likely to hold stocks to approximately a 674 million bushel 
level at the end of the 1975-76 marketing year, up from year-earlier 
stocks of 359 million bushels. Sharply increased domestic and export 
demand for soybeans is expected to hold stocks to approximately a 
330 million bushel level at the end of the 1975-76 marketing year, 
up from year-earlier stocks of 185 million bushels. Increased export 
demand for wheat appears likely to hold stocks to approximately a 
428 million bushel level at the end of the 1975-76 marketing year, 
up from
        <br/>
        year-earlier stocks of 327 million bushels.
       </p>
       <p>
        An improvement in loan demand during February was reported by Tenth 
District bankers contacted in a recent survey. Many bankers 
indicated that regional business loans had increased, but borrowing 
by national accounts was unchanged. The strength in regional 
business loans reflected increased financing needs for manufacturers 
working capital, construction activity, capital improvements, retail 
and auto dealer inventories, cattle purchases, and grain elevator 
storage. Although most banks have not yet seen any effects on their 
portfolios from the Midwest drought, one banker said it has caused a 
runoff in his holdings of cattle paper. Bankers also reported a 
pickup in real estate loans, particularly in the one-to four-family 
residential category. Consumer loans were said to be down more than 
seasonally, although auto loans have risen at some banks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand deposit inflows were reported to be strong. Time and savings 
deposits continued to increase, especially in the consumer area. Two 
banks reported declines in time deposits due to the Treasury's 
recent 8 percent note offering. Some banks are running down their 
negotiable certificates of deposit (CDs) due to the lower cost of 
alternative sources of funds, while others are competing for CD 
funds due to increasing loan demand.
