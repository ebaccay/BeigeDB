      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>

      <strong>
       September 13, 1972
      </strong>

      <p>
       The strength in consumer spending which was reported in the most 
recent GNP data does not appear to be uniformly reflected in the 
performance of a number of Tenth District large department stores. 
Reports of strong recent sales were less frequent than were reports 
of only modest to little improvement, with poor weather or discount 
competition usually cited as reasons. On the price front, retailers 
were about equally divided in their reports of further price 
increases from their suppliers, although even those who have 
experienced such increases reported that both competition and price 
controls have served to restrain the degree to which they could pass 
these on to their customers. During the month ended August 15, the 
index of prices received by farmers advanced to a new high, a factor 
which should underscore the sharp rise in Tenth District farm income 
reported in the last Red Book. However, the softness that has 
prevailed in slaughter cattle markets up until last week may dampen 
some of these gains despite the strong uptrend in grain prices. Loan 
demand continues strong at Tenth District member banks, and the 
general consensus of those banks interviewed is that the present 
level of loan demand will hold steady or increase somewhat over the 
remainder of the year. Unlike the near consensus which emerged last 
month in conversations with Tenth District manufacturing firms 
reporting much improved sales, discussions with a number of large 
department stores in the Tenth District elicited mixed opinions. 
With one exception, all respondents reported that sales were up, but 
the degree of recent improvement varied from city to city. Generally 
speaking, the Kansas City and Oklahoma City sales picture was 
stronger than was the situation in Denver. In Omaha, a large 
national outlet reported very strong sales while a local independent 
reported sales below a year ago-the only respondent to do so, citing 
strong competition from new shopping centers which has hurt their 
sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strength in furniture sales figured prominently in most reports of 
improved overall sales. Inventory behavior at the retail level still 
remains conservative. No stockpiling appears to be in evidence, as 
inventory investment is reported keeping pace with the current level 
of sales. Most respondents expressed optimism regarding the 
prospects for sales during the remainder of the year. When asked 
about price increases from suppliers, the replies were about evenly 
divided among those who reported further price increases and those 
reporting that their suppliers were holding the price line. Even in 
those cases where supply prices had been raised, those firms 
indicated that their ability to pass these increases on to their 
customers was constrained by their local competitive situation or by 
current price regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The index of prices received by farmers advanced to a new high 
during the month ended August 15. Since then, grain prices have been 
generally stronger-reflecting large sales to the Soviet Union as 
well as growing demands elsewhere-while livestock prices have 
averaged lower until very recently. Slaughter cattle prices, in 
particular, have been unusually soft, falling almost $5 per 
hundredweight from early July to late August with only a moderate 
increase in slaughter rates. Cattle prices so far in September have 
been stronger. Although cattle prices will probably remain 
reasonably stable, showing perhaps some firmness between now and the 
year-end, hog prices are expected to decline seasonally from the 
near-record high levels that currently exist, as the volume of 
marketing increases this fall and winter. Thus, the recent abatement 
of wholesale meat prices, together with the prospects for some 
further decline, likely will remove most of the pressure on food 
prices during the remainder of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Loan demand continues strong at Tenth District member banks. Among 
larger banks, where detailed data are available, demand is 
especially strong for business real estate and consumer installment 
credit. Tenth District weekly reporting bank statistics show this 
strength, and it is confirmed by interviews with banks throughout 
the District. Several banks report increases in loan commitments 
particularly to finance companies. In Kansas City, grain sales to 
Russia have also produced increased commitments. Commitments for 
real estate construction, agriculture, and international trade are 
also reported to have increased at one Denver bank. In response to 
the strength in loan demand, some banks have instituted changes in 
lending policies. A respondent in Tulsa and one in Denver report 
preferences for lending at shorter maturities. Another Denver bank 
is attempting to hold real estate loans at their current levels in 
order to increase loans in other lines. The general consensus of 
those banks interviewed is for the present level of loan demand to 
hold steady or increase somewhat over the remainder of 1972. In 
order to obtain additional loanable funds, many District banks have 
also become more aggressive in their attempts to attract CDs. In one 
instance, a bank in Oklahoma City has set its rates above those 
obtainable in money market centers. While the aggressiveness partly 
reflects the strength of loan demand, it is also in response to 
weakness in demand deposits that has produced outflows in total 
deposits.
      </p>
      <p>
       With only one exception of the banks contacted, the prime rate now 
prevailing is 5 1/2 percent with about half of the respondents 
having raised the rate in the last week of August. The lone 
exception carries a prime rate of 5 3/4 percent which is justified 
on the basis of local loan demand.
