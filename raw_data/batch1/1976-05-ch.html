      Beige Book Report: Chicago
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       May 12, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Business expectations continue to improve in the Seventh District. 
The greatest immediate concern is the unresolved rubber strike, 
which could drastically curtail motor vehicle output if it continues 
through the current month. Looking ahead, business and financial 
executives anticipate the reappearance of shortages on a widening 
scale as the upswing continues, and an acceleration of price 
inflation.
        <br/>
        The capital goods picture is somewhat brighter. Retail 
sales are excellent on a broad front. Single-family home 
construction activity has increased sharply, but other construction 
lags. Some S&amp;Ls are attempting to dampen the rapid inflow of 
deposits. Demand for business loans at banks remains soft. Farmland 
prices have increased very rapidly. Crop plantings are on schedule, 
or ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rubber strike that started April 21 was expected to cause 
serious trouble after about 30 days. Some cars and trucks already 
are being shipped without spare tires to extend supplies. The tire 
supply situation varies by model and is much worse for trucks than 
for autos, but all vehicle producers would be affected if the strike 
continues into June.
       </p>
       <p>
        New orders have improved in most manufacturing industries. Order 
backlogs either are rising or are declining less rapidly. More firms 
are planning to strengthen inventory positions and various capital 
expenditure programs are being reevaluated in the light of the more 
favorable outlook. The fact that many executives remained skeptical 
of the durability of the upturn until fairly recently means that 
decisions are only now being taken that will promote further 
expansion. Partly for this reason, fears are growing that margins of 
unused capacity have been overestimated, as in 1972.
       </p>
       <p>
        Order lead times are lengthening gradually, and more companies 
complain about a deterioration in "dependability." Supplies of some 
items are already inadequate, including various models of 
appliances, cars, trucks, and motor homes. In the latter case, 
output is limited by availability of components with no improvement 
likely. Steel is expected to be in short supply in the fourth 
quarter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor costs in many industries will rise 8 to 10 percent this year 
and there are doubts that the improvement in worker productivity 
will be sustained. Costs of materials, including steel and major 
nonferrous metals have increased recently, and are expected to rise 
further. Costs of insurance are soaring-auto, homeowner, and medical 
policies by 20 percent or more this year. An oil executive says 
refinery construction costs have doubled in the past three years, 
and may double again in another five years. The rise in housing 
construction costs has been cut in half, to about 5 percent, but may 
accelerate again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Output of heavy trucks, highway trailers, and related components has 
increased rapidly in the past two months. This uptrend is based not 
on actual sales, which remain very slow, but on expectations of 
increased sales, which one expert believes are about to "explode" as 
highway truck tonnage approaches capacity. This observer projects 
heavy truck sales at a new high for 1977.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sales of light construction equipment associated with home building 
have increased, but demand for heavy construction and earth-moving 
equipment has remained at a low level all year. One very large 
company is using this opportunity to build finished goods 
inventories in anticipation of an eventual uptrend in sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Orders for machine tools and sales of used machine tools have 
increased significantly, but order backlogs continue to decline, 
although at a slower pace. Sales of lift trucks and office furniture 
have improved. Demand for farm equipment is excellent. Oil 
exploration activity is slipping somewhat. Electric utilities are 
moving ahead more vigorously on new generating facilities as demand 
increases at a more normal pace.
       </p>
       <p>
        A major Chicago-area steel company with a strong market position 
says its new orders have exceeded capacity since January 1 and that 
output has been at capacity since early February. Promised delivery 
times have doubled since year-end. Many users apparently are 
building steel inventories again. A pickup in demand from the 
producer goods industries could mean general shortages of steel late 
this year. Foreign producers are not pushing sales here as much as 
in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retail sales for March and April probably should be considered 
together because of seasonal adjustment problems. Merchants are 
generally very pleased. Credit sales have increased relatively and 
collections are favorable. Except for subcompacts, car sales have 
been very strong. Motor homes and other "RVs" are booming again and 
some observers expect a new high for 1976. RV sales currently are 
limited by supplies. Except for freezers, all major appliances are 
showing large gains from last year. Sales of TV sets remain slow but 
an uptrend is expected in the fall. Japanese interests have acquired 
another U.S. TV producer, and the market is very competitive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Permits for single-family homes were double last year's level in 
March in major centers, and this uptrend apparently has continued. 
Apartment permits are up somewhat, but remain far below earlier 
years. Some S&amp;Ls; are limiting the extremely rapid inflows of 
deposits by restricting the size of passbook accounts and CDs. 
Typical home loan rates have moved down to the 8.5 to 8.75 percent 
range, and further easing of credit is expected to be reflected in 
reduced down payments. The Illinois usury rate will revert to 8 
percent at year end. This could cause problems if an extension is 
not voted several months before the deadline.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports of 7th District bankers in our most recent land value survey 
indicate that prices of good farmland rose about 7 percent on 
average in the first quarter, to a level 27 percent above year-ago. 
Reports were strongest from Illinois, but all sections of the 
District showed gains.
       </p>
       <p>
        Crop plantings are well along in the cornbelt. The picture in Iowa 
is about normal, while plantings in Illinois and Indiana range from 
normal to ahead of normal.
