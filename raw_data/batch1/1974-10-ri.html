      <p>
       The September survey of Fifth District businesses reveals a 
continued slowing in most sectors of the District economy, with the 
manufacturing sector showing the greatest decline. This decline 
seems to be centered in a few industries, but they are industries 
which contribute significantly to the Fifth District economy, 
including the textile and furniture industries. Construction, 
particularly residential construction, continues in a slump, and the 
effects are beginning to ripple throughout the District economy, 
impacting on employment and production in several important 
industries. New orders declined almost across the manufacturing 
sector, while inventories of finished goods continued to accumulate. 
The six months expectations of manufacturing firms turned decidedly 
pessimistic. In the banking sector, reduced demand and restrictive 
bank lending policies have slowed the growth of business loans 
relative to the first half of the year. The personal savings 
situation shows continued weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Survey responses from the manufacturing sector indicate broad and, 
in many areas, steep declines in the level of activity. Some decline 
in shipments was indicated, but a more accurate assessment of the 
trend might be based on the volume of new orders and the backlog of 
orders. Thirty-seven percent of the manufacturing respondents 
indicated declines in shipments while only 28 percent indicated 
increases. On the other hand, 58 percent reported a decrease in the 
volume of new orders and 51 percent reported a reduced backlog of 
orders. The last six months have shown a consistent, or perhaps 
accelerating, decline in new orders while the volume of shipments 
has generally remained firm. September represents only the, second 
month since March in which shipments, orders, and backlogs each 
showed a general weakness. Additionally, there was some further 
inventory accumulation in the finished goods area. Forty-eight 
percent of the manufacturers surveyed now feel inventory levels are 
excessive. More than twice as many manufacturers reported reductions 
than reported increases in the number of hours worked per week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although there are indications of a general weakening in the 
District economy, a review of the individual industries represented 
in the survey shows a few large industries are greatly influencing 
the overall picture. In the textile industry, shipments, orders, and 
backlogs were all off sharply, inventory levels were considered 
excessive and expectations were generally pessimistic. During 
September, there were scattered reports of textile firms slowing or 
ceasing production. Recent announcements include one-week closings 
of six plants by one firm and the dropping of a product line by 
another.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar conditions are reported by survey respondents in the 
furniture and fixtures industry where shipments, orders, and 
backlogs were down sharply and current inventory levels are 
considered excessive. Expectations among furniture manufacturers 
surveyed were decidedly negative, with one respondent feeling there 
is "no improvement in sight." Conditions in the furniture and 
fixtures industry are, of course, closely related to conditions in 
the depressed residential construction industry. Various reports 
show continuing decline. in building permits issued and high and 
rising unemployment among residential construction workers. Cutbacks 
in other industries are also being tied to the current housing 
market. For the second consecutive month, a major sheet glass 
producer has closed a production facility in the Fifth District. The 
lumber and wood products industry reports conditions very similar to 
those reported by the textile and furniture industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several factors, such as rising prices, tight credit conditions, and 
delays in obtaining materials, are having a depressing effect on the 
expectations of those manufacturers surveyed. Sixty-five percent now 
expect national business conditions to worsen over the next six 
months and almost as many, 58 percent, foresee a similar decline in 
their respective market areas. Perhaps more indicative of the 
general mood, the number expecting their own level of production to 
decrease now exceeds the number expecting it to increase over that 
period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Retailers responding to the September survey present a somewhat more 
optimistic picture, although the responses are difficult to 
interpret. Sales are generally reported to be increasing but it is 
not clear whether this indicates a real increase or merely increases 
in dollar volume. Sales of big ticket items relative to total sales 
continued to decline during September. There is some indication that 
inventories are accumulating beyond desired levels although this 
condition may not yet be widespread.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the banking sector, the efforts of banks to restrict business 
loan activity are having some impact as aggregate business loan 
expansion slowed relative to the first half of the year. There are 
also some indications that business loan demand is slowing as well. 
Commercial and industrial loans outstanding at District weekly 
reporting banks have shown essentially no growth over the past four 
months. Consumer savings deposits at commercial banks remain weak, 
having declined through September. Final July data for S&amp;L deposit 
activity in the Fifth District (excluding West Virginia) shows a net 
decline in savings of $49.8 million. Preliminary data for August 
indicate a net savings drop of $77.2 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Realized net farm income rose an unprecedented 68 percent in 1973. 
But District bank agricultural specialists, in a recent opinion 
survey, indicated a belief that net farm income will decline this 
year because soaring farm production costs will more than offset the 
slight gain in gross farm income.
