      Beige Book Report: Boston
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 9, 1972
      </strong>
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Our directors can barely perceive an upturn in business activity. 
With the exception of a few business lines connected with consumer 
goods, their businesses have experienced neither rising new orders, 
higher desired inventories, longer workweeks nor increased capital 
spending plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been little improvement in the labor situation. With the 
exception of two industries connected with consumer goods, no 
directors reported that their firms were adding workers or 
lengthening workweeks through increased overtime. Aerospace firms 
were either still laying off workers or had just arrived at the 
point where they were no longer anticipating further cutbacks in 
employment. There was a general feeling, however, that productivity 
was showing increases over last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       All our directors indicated that they still were maintaining a 
"tight ship" in regard to inventories and were not trying to raise 
their inventory to sales ratios. In line with higher consumer goods 
sales, an increase in consumer inventories was reported by a few 
manufacturers. The two major New England department stores reported 
that January sales were up strongly over last year's weak January 
sales and were about as strong as December's sales, on a seasonally 
adjusted basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       The directors reported being encouraged by the good performance of 
new orders for consumer goods, but new orders in the aerospace and 
machine tool industries were still below a year ago. One director 
whose company manufactures helicopters said he was not encouraged by 
the higher obligational authority in the fiscal 1973 budget for the 
defense department because this would not be translated into 
payments for a long time. He expects the aerospace industry, 
therefore, to remain on a plateau for several more years.
      </p>
      <p>
       When asked, none of our directors reported that the investment tax 
credit had made them raise their capital spending plans since last 
summer. Several directors noted, however, that their firm's capital 
spending would be above last year's levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our bank directors reported that there continues to be a large 
inflow of savings deposits and that the demand for mortgages at 
current rates is very strong. A large area bank, which accepts 
unlimited deposits, has been so inundated by large savings deposits, 
averaging $2-3 million each, from hospitals and universities that 
they are lowering interest rates by 1/2 percentage point on deposits 
above $100,000 as of mid-February. The bank directors said that it 
was very difficult to discern any increase in the demand for 
business loans, despite lower interest rates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of our directors noted that they were paying significantly 
higher prices to their suppliers. Steel price increases of 7-8 
percent were noted. Another director said that large price increases 
were posted by small suppliers, while the prices charged by large 
suppliers have remained stable. One director reported having 
received approval from the Price Board to raise prices on a number 
of goods, but most of our directors said that they had not raised 
prices, "yet." One director noted reducing the price of marble due 
to stiff foreign competition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Four new wage agreements were reported as having been settled. 
Settlements ranged between 5 1/2 percent to 8 percent. Despite the 
moderate wage increases, one director stated that his firm had had 
"their ears beaten back on work rules and operating nonunion 
plants."
      </p>
      <p>
       The three respondents who were contacted, Samuelson, Shapiro and 
Tobin, agreed that monetary policy should "keep pushing on the 
string."
      </p>
      <p>
       None shared the concern, which has been expressed in the press, that 
lower short rates would have adverse implications for the 
international monetary situation. Samuelson conjectured that 
continued expansion of reserves will help the money supply to take 
off in less than six months. Samuelson would require tangible signs 
of a successful recoveryâ€”more than two months of strong industrial 
production or a GNP gain of over $30 billionâ€”before he would "ease 
off." The pace of real recovery, not a target number for interest 
rates or money supply, should be the policy guide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobin argued that recent experience has made the public less quick 
to accept the monetarist view as their basis for forming 
inflationary expectations. Samuelson pointed out that first quarter 
inflation will reflect more upon the strength of Phase II than the 
possible "excessive" increases in the money stock. Since the "whole 
purpose" of controls, Tobin noted, was to "step on the gas," it 
would be particularly unfortunate to hold back demand in order to 
make the controls work. He felt it would be at least mid-year before 
evidence of a boom momentum could be sufficient to cause a policy 
reversal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shapiro felt that the fiscal 1972 deficit has been overestimated by 
$3 to $6 billion and that, with a $95 billion GNP gain, the 
estimated 1973 deficit may also turn out too high. He did feel that 
it was a tactical mistake not to have lowered the discount rate at 
the time the deficit was announced. The long market is currently 
frightened, he noted, but the long term trend will be down, and any 
rate increases would be transitory. Samuelson feels the relatively 
high current discount rate poses no problem so long as free reserves 
are kept around $200 million and repurchase agreements are conducted 
at low rates.
