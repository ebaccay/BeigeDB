      Beige Book Report: Atlanta
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       February 11, 1976
      </strong>
      <p>
       <p>
        Continued gradual economic recovery characterizes the Southeastern 
economy. A survey of retailers in the Sixth District reveals no 
ebbing during January of the strength of retail sales. Inventory 
rebuilding continues in some areas at rates in anticipation of 
ongoing sales increases. Some stores have begun selective price 
increases, and profits are improving. Still, financial difficulties 
continue to surface in retailing and real estate businesses. Labor 
market developments include the termination of a protracted strike 
as well as the recall of furloughed workers. Tax law provisions 
affecting state revenues may constrain state government spending in 
many areas. International trade is growing in importance in the 
Southeast.
       </p>
       <p>
        An early February survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Atlanta, confirmed by recent reports from directors, indicates that 
the resurgence of consumer spending at department stores has 
persisted. With very few exceptions, retailers' earlier concerns 
that there might be a downturn following the holiday season have not 
been realized. January sales reflect a normal seasonal decline, with 
the result that impressive percentage gains from last year's results 
are being maintained. Most merchandise categories appear to be 
participating in the sustained strength of sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retailers report ongoing price increases on goods they are 
purchasing, but no unusually large jumps are reported in particular 
merchandise categories. Goods, in general, are readily available 
from manufacturers, with the exception of especially popular 
products such as prewashed denim apparel and Citizens' Band radios. 
(Mood rings have sunk into a deep depression; pet rocks are on the 
endangered species list.) Most department stores are reordering in 
line with the increasing trend of sales. Some, in areas where sales 
improvements have been particularly strong, anticipate continuing 
increases and are placing orders in accordance with this projection. 
Nevertheless, restraint in building inventories continues to be a 
primary consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some retailers have begun selective, gradual increases in their 
prices but are proceeding with care. None of these merchants report 
encountering resistance from customers. Several stores mention a 
very gradual increase in the percentage of goods purchased on 
credit, although the percentage of cash purchases remains above pre-recession norms. One report was received of an effort to encourage 
new credit accounts as well as greater use of existing ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other comments from retailers indicate that the solid sales gains 
achieved during and after the holiday season were attained without 
markdowns and heavy promotions which characterized retailing in late 
1974. The profit outlook is, therefore, much improved. Retailers 
note that, as a result of reduced manufacturers' inventories, goods 
obtained at low prices for use during promotions are very scarce. In 
general, the best sales increases are reported by top-of-the-line 
department stores which suffered greater sales erosion a year ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Information of a less positive hue is largely limited to reports 
from Florida, where January sales in some areas have produced much 
less impressive increases than those of December. However, 
independent variety stores in Florida are reportedly reordering in 
line with sales following a very successful Christmas season. 
Concerning trends by type of merchandise in the Southeast, it is 
reported that furniture and carpet sales are encouraging but 
appliance sales in certain areas remain subnormal. Kennedy and 
Cohen, a large electrical appliance chain headquartered in Miami, 
was forced by financial difficulties to close 17 stores located in 
several major cities and to release over 650 employees. The 
organization subsequently filed for protection under the bankruptcy 
laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reports of financial difficulty also appeared in the troubled real 
estate industry. Control of a recently completed 35-story office 
building in downtown Atlanta has been acquired by a large out-of-state bank and an insurance company which had supplied construction 
financing. The building presently has only about six tenants, 
despite the very liberal leasing arrangements being offered. This 
case exemplifies the severely overbuilt condition of the office 
space market in Atlanta. Lessors are engaged in a bidding contest 
for occupants because anticipated rates of entry and expansion by 
firms have not been realized. One real estate consultant reports 
that general office space in the downtown area is about 28 percent 
vacant, with six major new projects only 23 percent rented. A carpet 
supplier notes that about 20 percent of a recent mailing addressed 
to smaller carpet specialty shops and decorators was returned, 
indicating that many of these small businesses have been unable to 
weather the recession in the construction industry. Concern is 
voiced by some branch directors that disclosures of "problem" loans 
in testimony before congressional committees may precipitate 
financial pressures sufficient to force business firms into 
bankruptcy, thereby jeopardizing the employment of many workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        A brighter note about construction activity concerns three new 
hotels oriented toward convention business which have recently been 
completed in Atlanta. A total of 2,850 rooms have been added to the 
city's hotel accommodations, all of which are near the downtown 
area. The negative aspect of reduced construction employment is 
offset by increased services employment produced by the opening of 
the three hotels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional developments in Southeastern labor markets include the 
end of the 126-day strike of flight attendants against National Air 
Lines during early January. One community served by the carrier is 
reportedly seeking to obtain more reliable service by having its 
route transferred to another carrier. Also, 1,800 workers who were 
laid off two years ago, were recalled by the General Motors plant in 
Atlanta as a result of improvements in new car sales; an additional 
500 new jobs have been created. The plant payroll during 1976 is 
expected to double that for last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        A fiscal problem has surfaced in Georgia which may also be affecting 
other state governments. Tax revenues are not expected to increase 
in proportion to increases in income, owing to provisions allowing 
previous years' losses to be carried forward in computing corporate 
income taxes. Carrying forward of losses is expected to place a 
restraint on expenditures by the state government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The role of the Southeast in international trade appears to be 
expanding. Southwire Corporation has entered into an agreement with 
the Soviet Union to market Russian chemical and metallurgical 
technology in the United States. Coca-Cola has contracted on a trial 
basis to supply Russia with lemons from Florida. In addition, a new 
duty-free foreign trade zone is being established south of Atlanta. 
Manufacturing and assembly areas will be provided in addition to 
warehousing and distribution facilities.
