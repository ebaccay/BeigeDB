      Beige Book Report: New York

      <strong>
       February 9, 1972
      </strong>

      <p>
       Mixed opinions were expressed recently by the directors of this Bank 
and of the Buffalo Branch as well as other local businessmen 
regarding the current economic situation. Most were disturbed by the 
implications of the President's budget message, but on balance felt 
that so far Phase II was having a beneficial effect on the economy; 
only scattered improvement was reported in the unemployment picture. 
In general, it was felt that the prospects for increased business 
outlays on plant and equipment had not materially improved over the 
recent past. However, the majority looked for increased inventory 
outlays, reflecting in good part a strengthening of consumer 
confidence, as reported by the retailers that were contacted. Most 
directors that expressed an opinion felt that the international 
currency realignment had not had, but eventually would have, a 
beneficial impact on the country's trade balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concern, in varying degrees, was expressed over the President's 
recent budget message. All of the Buffalo Branch directors saw the 
deficit as adding to inflationary forces, although the majority felt 
that its likely stimulative effect on the economy would not be 
excessive. One of these directors, however, the Vice President of 
one of the largest up-state firms, saw a greater danger of over-stimulation from the projected deficit for fiscal 1973 than from the 
current year's deficit. The chairman of the board of a large New 
York City bank thought that the $87 billion of deficits compiled in 
three years could signal that huge deficits were becoming a fiscal 
"way of life," which would make inflation difficult to check while 
other directors also were concerned over current fiscal policy. 
Among the local businessmen contacted for an opinion on this issue, 
the senior partner of a leading accounting firm felt that the "last-minute disclosure" of the size of the projected deficit has shaken 
public confidence, and had left many businessmen "dismayed." A 
leading New York City banker doubted that expenditures and the 
deficit would reach projected levels, but in any event felt that the 
release of these figures had generated uncertainty in the financial 
markets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentiments were mixed regarding the effectiveness of Phase II. On 
balance the respondents felt that it was having a constructive 
effect. Most regarded the Price Commission as being more effective 
than the Pay Board in reducing inflationary pressures, but a member 
expressed the opinion that the Pay Board has had some psychological 
effect in reducing the size, as well as the number, of wage 
increases demands, a fact which is not reflected in statistics it 
releases. Among the specific comments made, the President of a large 
copper firm said that the Pay Board "hasn't demonstrated that it had 
things under control," a feeling that was shared by the chairman of 
the board of a large New York City bank. Several of the Buffalo 
Branch directors pointed to apparent inequities in the Board's 
rulings, which they felt resulted from the use of different 
standards for particular labor groups. On the other hand, the 
president of a large liquor manufacturing firm reported that the 
"Board had been a definite factor" in keeping down the wage 
increases for his firm in a recent wage settlement, while a 
Rochester businessman noted that fewer of his employees have been 
asking individually for wage increases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the employment situation, the vice-president of one of the 
largest up-state firms expected the increases in hours worked to 
foreshadow additional hirings. The job situation in Rochester was 
reported to have shown a steady improvement since last May. Other 
directors and other business leaders, however, were unable to detect 
an improvement in the current unemployment picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to outlays for plant and equipment, the directors and 
other business leaders expressing an opinion on this subject 
continued to look for little change, in good part because of the 
high rate of unused capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The outlook for increased inventory outlays, however, seems to have 
improved on balance. Buffalo Branch directors shared a feeling 
expressed by one of them that "inventory downward adjustments have 
bottomed out." Moreover, the local retailers that were contacted, 
while reporting that January sales were below expectation in the New 
York City area, in general looked for a good year and indicated that 
they were planning to increase their inventories accordingly. A 
senior executive of New York City's largest department store was 
most optimistic, and looked for a "very very" good year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the impact of the international currency realignments, 
the Buffalo Branch directors felt these measures were a step in the 
right direction but that it was still too early to detect signs of 
an improvement in the competitive position of United States goods in 
world markets. The chairman of the board of a large New York City 
bank expected no real change in the trade balance before 1972. Other 
respondents felt that the realignments would ultimately have a 
favorable impact on their firms competitive positions, but it was 
noted that they did not seem to have much effect on imports from 
Japan.
