      <p>
       The Second District directors and other business leaders who were 
contacted recently generally expressed doubts regarding the 
effectiveness of Phase IV in bringing about price and wage 
stability. Most respondents felt that the dollar-for-dollar cost 
pass-through provision would, with varying intensity, squeeze profit 
margins. Several directors reported that so far tightening credit 
conditions have had little effect on business spending plans of 
larger firms, but some noted it was having a dampening effect on 
smaller businesses. A marked tightening of the mortgage market was 
also indicated.
      </p>
      <p>
       A note of skepticism marked the directors' initial assessment of the 
probable impact of Phase IV on the prospects for price and wage 
stability. Thus, one director characterized this part of the 
Administration's stabilization efforts as a "triumph of political 
expediency over economic reality". This view was shared by a number 
of other directors, who also felt that while the new controls might 
be partially effective as a "stop gap" measure in achieving price 
and wage stability, growing shortages—notably of agricultural 
products—would unavoidably lead to increases in the cost of living 
and in turn to heightened wage demands. The chairman of the board of 
one of the largest New York City banks stated that an assessment of 
the impact of the new measure was difficult, particularly because of 
the uncertainties surrounding the implications for wages of a 
prospective rapid rise in food and certain other prices. In this 
context, he felt that at this juncture the longer term outlook for 
wages and prices seemed closely linked to the extent of the increase 
in agricultural output and production and its stabilizing influence 
on the price level generally. The president of a large metal 
producing concern observed that the controls were causing severe 
domestic shortages of certain internationally traded key materials. 
He felt that the biggest problem associated with Phase IV was the 
30-day pre-notification period for price increases applications by 
large firms, which he deemed much too long, making it "extremely 
difficult" for businesses to respond effectively to changing demand 
and/or cost considerations. The president of an upstate bank noted 
that, in contrast to the widespread support accorded Phases I and 
II, small businessmen in his area were "not at all pleased" with 
Phase IV, and that cooperation in the program was not likely to be 
forthcoming. On the other hand, an upstate manufacturer assumed 
there would be tolerance of and adherence to the Phase IV program 
for a reasonable period of time—at least through April 1974—and 
felt that the mandated controls were tough enough to enable a return 
to a more reasonable and acceptable rate of inflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the effect of the dollar-for-dollar cost pass-through limitation on profit margins, it was the consensus of the 
Buffalo branch directors that this proviso would result in some 
contraction of profit margins in the short run, at least as measured 
on a percent of sales basis. The reduction, however, was not 
expected to be significant, barring a substantial fall in demand. 
The New York banker felt, however, that this rule could create 
significant problems for certain firms and reported that his bank's 
research personnel estimated it would reduce after-tax profits by 
about $2 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of the respondents reported that the dollar-for-dollar pass-through would have an immediate effect on business spending plans. 
Views were mixed, however, regarding the impact of tightening credit 
conditions on such plans. The New York banker reported that he had 
not seen widespread evidence that capital spending plans were being 
deferred as a result of high interest rates and tightening credit 
conditions, although he felt that shortages of equipment and 
material could have a dampening effect on such outlays. A senior 
official of a large multinational firm said that not only have 
tightened credit conditions not had an appreciable effect on capital 
spending, but that there was evidence of a "spend-now" philosophy in 
the face of inflationary expectations. A similar view was expressed 
by the president of the large metal producing firm, while another 
director reported that executives of large firms with whom he had 
contacts had suggested to him that capital spending plans were not 
being materially affected by higher interest rates: cash flows were 
still sufficiently large to finance capital outlays and thus these 
firms were not especially sensitive to interest rate considerations. 
On the other hand, an upstate banker reported that in his area, the 
high levels of interest rates were starting to have a dampening 
effect on capital spending decisions. He reported that among smaller 
businessmen with whom he had contact, borrowing rates in the range 
of 7 1/2 percent or higher tended to have an immediate adverse 
effect on their willingness to commit funds. Similarly, most Buffalo 
branch directors felt tighter credit conditions were bound to have 
an impact on business spending plans. These directors cited 
instances where bank customers were postponing borrowing and 
spending plans, and reported that banks were rationing available 
funds by extending credit to their own customers first.
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been a significant tightening in Second District mortgage 
market conditions according to the opinions expressed by a number of 
directors and major lenders in that market. Senior officials of 
thrift institutions reported that as a result of a net outflow of 
deposits, together with a sizable backlog of unclosed loan 
commitments, little or no funds were available for new mortgages in 
the 1- to 4-family home sector. A New Jersey savings bank thus 
reported it was making loans only to depositors, with a 40 percent 
down payment, and an official of a large New York savings bank 
claimed that at this time "there was no home mortgage market" and 
that his institution was entering into no new commitments for 1- to 
4-family homes. Against this background, the respondents felt that 
the recent increase in the usury ceiling from 7.5 percent to 8 
percent in New York and New Jersey (effective August 15 in New York) 
would have little or no effect at this time on the home mortgage 
market. Officials at the insurance companies, commercial banks, and 
mortgage companies who were contacted reported that construction 
loans and mortgages for commercial properties—apartments, shopping 
centers, office buildings—were available, but at very high rates. 
In this context, several respondents reported a drop in recent weeks 
in the demand for such loans, which they attributed in part to the 
high rates and in part to overbuilding in this sector.
