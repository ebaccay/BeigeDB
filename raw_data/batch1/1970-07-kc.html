     <h1>
      Beige Book Report: Kansas City
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 15, 1970
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The overall economic picture in the Tenth District remains much the 
same as reported in the last Red Book, with construction strikes and 
reduced defense production restricting economic activity in specific 
areas. Firms participating in national markets are, of course, 
reflecting and sharing the sluggish performance of the national 
economy. A survey of Directors and a sample of purchasing managers 
revealed some evidence of favorable back-pressures on prices paid, 
particularly on volume orders and longer term contracts, an 
indication that some suppliers believe prices at least may not 
continue increasing as rapidly as in the past. In most instances, 
however, suppliers apparently are not yet engaging in any widespread 
price concessions or shading of prices from list.
     </p>
     <p>
      A number of firms included in the survey were relatively large users 
of metal, especially steel and steel products, but also of copper 
and brass. Virtually all respondents reported that suppliers of 
steel were holding the line on recent price increases, and there was 
little expectation that this situation would change in the near 
future. Reports from copper users were mixed. For example, one 
reported that the situation for copper remained tight while another 
noted some reductions in list prices for particular copper products 
and an additional shading from list for certain items, such as brass 
strip. One relatively large steel user, whose overall business is 
off, has increased its relative use of foreign (Japanese) steel by 
holding that absolute amount steady and reducing its purchases of 
domestic steel. Although price differentials between Japanese and 
domestic steel are apparently diminishing (depending on type), this 
firm would take still more Japanese steel if it weren't bumping into 
the voluntary allotment ceilings.
     </p>
     <p>
      No clear picture emerged from the responses of firms dealing in 
markets for chemicals and chemical products. One respondent reported 
chemicals prices going up faster in the last six months. Another 
noted that prices were lower on some items where suppliers were 
operating in industries where activity had slowed. A third noted 
that their request for bids on volume purchases had met with 
aggressive response from medium-size companies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Particular industries have their own special situations and special 
problems. A Kansas City lumber company stated that not only was 
business here lousy because of the continuing construction strike, 
but sales to lumber dealers outside Kansas City also were bad, which 
they attributed to the general economic slowdown and to tight money 
conditions. They felt that lumber markets generally were weaker with 
mill prices down although freight charges have been rising. A 
printing concern reported their commercial printing business to be 
off somewhat, but their frozen food packages business doing well. 
According to this source, recently announced price increases for 
paper were rolled back, failing to hold because of the economic 
slowdown. But they expect these prices to go up again in the near 
future, and to hold at that time.
     </p>
     <p>
      Specialized firms tied to other industries that are in trouble 
naturally find themselves in trouble. An electrical equipment 
company which is closely tied to the aircraft industry finds itself 
with significantly reduced sales, a situation expected to continue 
until overall improvement in economic activity is reflected in the 
aircraft industry. This firm sees no improvement in the prices they 
pay, although deliveries have improved. Another firm, specializing 
in production of sewage treatment facilities, attributes the 
slowdown in its business to the inability of local governments to 
purchase because of "tight money" and a reduced availability of 
Federal grants. The prices they pay for everything from janitor
supplies to electrical equipment are still rising, and they report 
no luck in getting price concessions as suppliers continue to stick 
to list prices.
     </p>
     <p>
      One thread of optimism regarding prices may be found running through 
the responses of several of the larger firms in recent months. These 
firms have observed some leveling off in the prices they pay, and 
(outside of steel) a little greater willingness by suppliers to 
negotiate on prices. For example, a large greeting card maker notes 
that more salesmen are calling in person, and appear to be 
scrambling for business. Volume discounts are more available, and 
suppliers seem to be more ready to deal because they are interested 
in keeping their own plants operating. A metals fabricator reports 
that, although metals prices remain firm, suppliers of other items 
are now willing to discuss prices and some price cuts can be 
negotiated.
     </p>
     <p>
      A manufacturer of automatic merchandising equipment reports that 
sellers appear to be more interested now in annual contracts on 
which they will give a little better price in order to be assured a 
share of the business. No such concessions were available a year 
ago, but suppliers seem to be more receptive now. Buyers must work 
hard for price concessions, but they can be obtained. A similar 
viewpointâ€”that the situation calls for hard work by purchasing 
agents in resisting price increasesâ€”was expressed by a 
representative of a large manufacturer of electronic components and 
wired carrier equipment. In their view the general economic slowdown 
has made it possible for purchasing agents to negotiate prices in a 
better atmosphere and hopefully to do better in controlling price 
increases on the goods they buy.
