      Beige Book Report: Richmond
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       October 21, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The October survey of Fifth District business conditions suggests a 
continuation of the recent pace of recovery. Manufacturers continue 
to report increases in shipments and new orders, although 
improvement in the orders picture was apparently less widespread 
than a month ago. Inventories continue to decline, and there is some 
indication that they are coming into line with desired levels. The 
number of manufacturers reporting inventories as excessive is the 
smallest in over a year, although it still amounts to one-third of 
the respondents. Some improvement in unemployment rates is reported, 
but it is not clear that increases in employment are the primary 
factor in this improvement. Our survey of retailers suggests further 
general improvement in sales, while sales of big-ticket items 
relative to total sales seem to have stabilized. In the banking 
sector consumer and real estate loans have continued to post modest 
but steady gains. Business loans, however, continue sluggish in most 
parts of the district. In agriculture, lower prices and a smaller 
volume of sales of flue-cured tobacco have combined to reduce the 
value of marketings some 12 percent, or over $100 million, from a 
year earlier.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Manufacturing respondents to our October survey report continued 
increases in shipments and in volume of new orders. Increases in new 
orders, however, were not quite so widespread as in the previous 
month and backlogs showed little change. The diffusion of survey 
responses this month suggests the greatest, or at least the 
broadest, inventory liquidation of the year. Over 45 percent of the 
manufacturers surveyed report declines in materials and almost 40 
percent report declines in finished goods inventories. One 
respondent stated explicitly that his firm is shipping from 
inventories. This widespread inventory runoff has now continued for 
six months and may be tapering off. One-third of our respondents, 
the smallest number in over a year, still view current inventory 
levels as excessive. About one-sixth report current levels as too 
low.
      </p>
      <p>
       While little change in manufacturing employment during September is 
reported, there does seem to have been some increase in hours worked 
per week. Respondents reporting increases outnumber those reporting 
decreases by three to one. Employee compensation and prices 
continued to move up across a broad range although only one-fourth 
of the manufacturers reported receiving higher prices during the 
month of September. Approximately 40 percent of the manufacturers 
believe that current plant and equipment capacity is excessive, but 
almost 90 percent feel current expansion plans are about right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Concerning the outlook for the next six months, there persists a 
basic mood of optimism although it is not as pervasive as in some 
recent months, and there is actually less optimism expressed in the 
outlook for the respondents' respective industries. Fewer than half 
of those responding expect the level of production in their own 
firms to improve during the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       The October survey of retailers suggests improved sales during 
September, but sales of big-ticket items relative to total sales 
were apparently unchanged. The prolonged relative decline in sales 
of big-ticket items would suggest that although such sales may have 
stabilized, they continue at a very low level. Inventories at the 
retail level declined further during the month and have apparently 
been brought into line with desired levels. The number of retail 
employees appears to have declined somewhat, while our survey 
respondents were unanimous in reporting increases in employee 
compensation. All respondents reported paying and receiving higher 
prices. There also appears to have been some deterioration in the 
outlook as 80 percent of our retail respondents now expect the level 
of business activity and of sales in their respective firms to be 
unchanged over the next six months.
      </p>
      <p>
       Asset expansion among Fifth District banks has followed an irregular 
pattern in recent weeks, with advances in some loan categories 
offset by weakness in other areas. Bank interest in investments has 
also weakened. Consumer installment loan volume at weekly reporting 
banks continued to show strength in September as compared to earlier 
months. Real estate loans also expanded in September and are running 
about 7-1/2 percent above a year earlier. Contrary to expectations 
expressed in August, and again as recently as mid-September, 
business loan volume has been weak. The notable exceptions are loans 
to the retail trade and tobacco industries, where seasonal 
influences have resulted in strong gains. Demand deposit growth has 
continued but the rate of inflow of consumer time deposits has 
fallen and savings deposits have suffered an absolute decline. Rate 
competition is also affecting S&amp;L deposits. CD attrition continues. 
Average daily member bank borrowings increased in September to their 
highest level since January, but net federal funds purchases of 
member banks fell by about one-third from the August level.
      </p>
      <p>
       District cash farm income for the January to July period was up 
about 1 percent over a year ago. The seven-month figure represented 
the first year-to-date period which showed an increase over the 
comparable period in 1974. Flue-cured tobacco prices have improved 
in recent weeks, but the season average price as of October 2 was 
still running 6 percent under last year's level. September 1 
estimates indicate that the district's 1975 production of field 
crops, with the exception of tobacco, soybeans, and sweet potatoes, 
will be under 1974 levels.
