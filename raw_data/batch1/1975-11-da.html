      Beige Book Report: Dallas
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       November 12, 1975
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      Lending activity at the district's largest banks continues to 
weaken. Total loans at weekly reporting banks have edged downward 
since the first quarter of this year. The lackluster pace of lending 
is reflected in the aggregate loan-deposit ratio for these banks 
which continues to fall and now stands 11 percent below the cyclical 
peak in February 1974. Although loan demand is weak, bankers admit 
that restrictive lending policies are playing a major role in 
holding down the volume of loans. In fact, a veteran Fort Worth loan 
officer has said that today's borrowers are facing the most 
stringent credit requirements he has seen in his career with the 
bank.
     </p>
     <div>
      <p>
       Commercial and industrial loan demand are running well below the 
level most loan officers expected during this phase of the recovery. 
There appears to be little inventory accumulation in progress. One 
reason for this is that many manufacturers are finding materials and 
unfinished goods readily available from suppliers. They are taking 
advantage of this favorable supply situation by keeping their own 
stocks low, thereby reducing working capital requirements. In 
addition, the high level of earnings generated over the past couple 
of years by many energy-related firms, particularly suppliers of oil 
field equipment, has reduced the need for bank credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the volume of business loans remains low, the composition of 
demand for funds has shifted markedly. Loan officers report they are 
being besieged by applications for term loans. Moreover, these 
requests are altogether different from the type of term-loan demand 
bankers saw in the early seventies. Then, customers sought term 
loans for "productive" purposes—to finance plant and equipment 
expenditures and for corporate acquisitions. But today, according to 
these bankers, virtually all such applications are from customers 
with depleted working capital who are seeking to improve their 
liquidity positions by converting much of their short-term bank 
borrowing to term debt. Loan officers maintain that these firms have 
not been able to "get their house in order" following the severe 
dislocations of the past couple of years. The vast majority of these 
term-loan requests are being turned down.
      </p>
      <p>
       In real estate lending, reducing exposure to potential REIT losses 
continues to be the dominant concern of loan officers at the larger 
banks. Nevertheless, bankers appear somewhat more optimistic about 
these loans even though there are only a handful of sound REIT lines 
among the banks surveyed. Although payoffs have been slow, in a 
number of cases they have been running well ahead of the pace 
predicted earlier this year. A Houston loan officer, for example, 
says his bank has reduced REIT loans to $40 million, down from $48 
million just a few months ago, and none of these lines are currently 
being carried on a nonaccrual basis. According to an El Paso banker, 
the payback from a REIT bankruptcy has reached 25 percent and is 
expected to go higher, reducing that loss to less than the amount 
the bank had already charged off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bankers report a favorable outlook for expansion in consumer credit 
during the coming holiday season in light of growing indications 
that consumers are stepping up their spending. One positive sign has 
been a sharp decrease in the number of applications for debt 
consolidation loans this year. Credit card usage is on the rise, and 
suburban bankers note that automobile loans have picked up. In 
addition, there are numerous reports of banks offering comprehensive 
service packages in attempts to rekindle consumer borrowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good harvests, increased marketings of cattle, and higher average 
prices since midyear have bolstered crop and livestock sales in the 
Eleventh District. Consequently, cash flows to farmers and ranches 
have improved, and rural bankers report the rate of loan repayment 
has increased while the number of renewals and extensions has 
declined. Although flush with funds, agribankers continue to be very 
cautious in granting credit. Uncertainty over markets and weather 
and the carryover effects of depressed incomes in 1974, particularly 
among cattle feeders, serve to keep collateral requirements firm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nevertheless, agricultural lending this fall is above year-earlier 
levels. Rising production costs and slightly more acreage in 
cultivation have increased the farmer's demand for bank credit. And, 
as a result of good harvests, the volume of crop storage loans is up 
substantially. Also, improved income prospects have led to more farm 
machinery loans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Livestock lending has been bolstered by a large increase in the 
number of calves on feed since midyear. However, strength in the 
livestock sector is being tempered by a reduction in cattle 
purchased for grazing, owing to the dry weather that has lowered the 
prospects for winter foraging. In addition, dairymen continue to 
trim capital outlays in response to the severe cost-price squeeze in 
that industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The men's and women's spring apparel shows held at the Dallas 
Apparel Mart in October attracted a record number of buyers and 
sellers from across the country. Sales were termed brisk as 
retailers attempted to replenish their depleted inventories. Some 
manufacturers felt that many buyers were double-ordering to insure 
delivery of goods. Double-ordering stemmed from the fact that 
shortages of some piece goods have appeared, and some firms are 
finding it difficult to meet delivery schedules. Apparel 
manufacturing in Texas continues to recover, as production is now 15 
percent above the March low. Sales to the national retail chains, 
which represent most of the state's output, have rebounded strongly. 
Several new manufacturing facilities began production last quarter, 
and one of the state's largest garment makers reopened a large plant 
last month that was closed down in February.
