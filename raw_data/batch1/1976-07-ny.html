      Beige Book Report: New York
     </h1>
     <p>
      <strong>
       July 14, 1976
      </strong>
     </p>
     <p>
      The economic recovery in the Second District continues to lag behind 
  that of the rest of the nation, but recent developments have not 
  materially altered the assessment of District directors and business 
  leaders who were recently questioned about the economic outlook. 
  Merchants do not appear overly concerned by the softening of retail 
  activity, which they regard as temporary, but they are generally 
  following tight inventory policies. On the financial front, business 
  loan demand continues to languish in New York City, although a few 
  directors reported scattered evidence of a pickup outside of the 
  city. Commercial banks in New York have begun to respond to the 
  challenge of checking accounts at mutual savings banks by 
  eliminating or lowering checking fees.
     </p>
     <p>
      Consumer spending in this District remained sluggish overall in 
  June, although there were mixed reports of an upturn. The president 
  of a major pharmaceutical concern reported a slowdown in some 
  consumer markets in May and June. The controller of a major New York 
  City department store also reported that sales continued weak in 
  June. In western New York state, the Buffalo directors found little 
  indication of any significant increase in consumer spending except 
  for automobile sales. On the other hand, a Rochester retailer found 
  June's sales, though soft, stronger than May's. Many stores, in an 
  effort to limit inventory accumulation, have begun to mark down 
  merchandise prices earlier this year than usual. In this connection, 
  a senior official of a nationwide chain specializing in apparel and 
  other soft goods said his firm planned June and July markdowns that 
  are greater than normal.
     </p>
     <p>
      Beyond their cautious inventory policies, retailers do not appear 
  overly concerned by the softening of sales activity and have not 
  altered their fundamental assessment of the future. Respondents 
  believe that consumer spending will pick up again in coming months, 
  but do not expect an upsurge as strong as that experienced early in 
  the year. Echoing this view, the president of the pharmaceutical 
  firm discounted the downbeat findings of recent consumer confidence 
  surveys, arguing that they have no predictive value but merely 
  confirm current market conditions. In the view of Buffalo directors, 
  consumer confidence remains favorable as inflation decelerates and 
  real income rises.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of the retail business sector, most other respondents did 
  not appear concerned over inventories. The president of a large 
  distributor of electric equipment said his company's inventories 
  were "in great shape." The treasurer of a metal-fabricating company 
  reported that his once massive inventory overhang had been 
  eliminated and that overall inventories were now "just about at 
  optimal levels." An economist for an oil company felt his firm's 
  inventories were generally in a normal range, with gasoline stocks 
  being built up in anticipation of future tightness.
     </p>
     <p>
      On the outlook for wage pressures, directors of the Buffalo branch 
  felt that demands for wage increases have moderated somewhat. The 
  president of a large utility reported that his company is 
  experiencing record low job turnover and felt that this may allow 
  him to break out of the national pattern of pay increases. 
  Respondents, however, remained wary of aggressive wage demands of 
  unions. One director, who is associated with the automotive 
  industry, felt that the relative moderation of wage demands in that 
  industry was due to the fact that pressures for catch-up pay 
  increases were largely behind us. An official of a nationwide retail 
  chain termed the wage situation in his industry as "stable." With 
  only a small fraction of his work force unionized, he felt that the 
  abundance of unskilled workers eliminated economic pressures to 
  raise wages.
     </p>
     <p>
      Surveying the financial scene, business loan demand in New York City 
  continues to languish and respondents do not see signs of a 
  turnaround. However, the chairman of a major New York City bank 
  indicated that there were signs of recovery in loan demand at some 
  rural and regional banks outside of the central money markets. In 
  New York State, mixed evidence on this point was offered by various 
  directors. One reported loan demand was flat in central parts of the 
  state, while another cited an incipient recovery in the Binghampton 
  area.
     </p>
     <p>
      While New York City loan demand remains sluggish, competition for 
  demand deposits has developed as a result of mutual savings banks 
  bidding for commercial bank customers. Recent legislation now 
  permits mutual savings banks in New York State to issue non 
  interest-bearing demand deposits. A trade association for these 
  thrift institutions indicated that as of the end of June three-fourths of its membership (84 out of 118 members) were offering 
  these accounts. In the few weeks that the accounts have been 
  available, deposits have grown rapidly and already exceed $100 
  million. In response to this rapid growth and aggressive marketing 
  by savings banks, commercial banks have begun to eliminate or 
  substantially reduce checking charges.
     </p>
     <p>
      While the regional recovery generally continues to lag the national 
  economy, there were some encouraging developments in the District's 
  employment situation. The New York State unemployment rate (not 
  seasonally adjusted) declined 0.6 percentage points to 8.9 percent 
  in May, the first time in 30 months that it was lower than a year 
  earlier. In Buffalo, where joblessness has persistently been the 
  worst in the District, the unemployment rate fell from a high of 
  12.1 percent in March to 10.4 percent in May. This is also well 
  below its 11.5 percent rate of May 1975. After holding steady at 
  10.7 percent in March and April, the New York City unemployment rate 
  fell to 10.1 percent. This improvement is somewhat illusory, 
  however, since it was caused less by an increase in jobholders than 
  by a reduction in the work force. Indeed, New York City's recovery 
  from the recession has fallen further behind that of the nation. The 
  city's unemployment rate in May was 3.4 percentage points higher 
  than the national rate, while in January this difference was only 
  2.6 percentage points. Of the five downstate counties surrounding 
  New York City, each registered improvement in the jobless rate, but 
  only one had a rate below the national average.
